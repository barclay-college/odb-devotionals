Editor’s Picks: Top 3 Articles | Social Issues

Author: by YMI

It’s impossible to turn a blind eye to the problems all around us.

For centuries, societies have had to deal with perennial issues like
unemployment, crime and violence, and poverty. Those aside, there
seems to have been a rise of others like terrorism and discrimination
(of different forms) recently.

Like it or not, we are all affected in one way or another. And there
appears to be no end to the problems we face in our world.

How then should we respond to them? Can we as Christians make any
difference?

Here are three articles that give a refreshing perspective to some of
the issues we face in our world today.



Everybody loves a good cause.  We all want to fight for something,
champion it, believe in it, and convince people of it. You need only
to surf the web for a few minutes to stumble across somebody ranting
about something or wanting to change how something is being done . . .
As Christians, should we follow the latest trends and campaigns on
social media? Should we join in the “fight”?



It’s hard to keep track of everything that has been said about Paris,
Beirut, terrorism, and the state of our world in the past few days. So
many perspectives have been raised, and so many emotions evoked. But
what the recent spate of horrific attacks has really highlighted is
this: everyone is susceptible.

Nobody is immune; nobody is safe these days anymore.



Many people struggle to make sense of their illnesses, and worry about
how long they have to endure the illness, and how their lives would
turn out. Having struggled through such adversities with my patients
and their families, I’ve learned that what’s important is how people
respond to their illnesses and try to make sense of them.
