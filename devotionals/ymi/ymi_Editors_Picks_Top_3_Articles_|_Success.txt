Editor’s Picks: Top 3 Articles | Success

Author: by YMI

Success. We crave it. We want it. We love it.

We all desire to be successful in all aspects of our lives. Whether in
school, in the workplace or even in church, it’s always about
achieving better—and more.

But ever wondered why we’re always on this pursuit? When will we
finally attain success? What is success exactly?

Here are three insightful pieces that will shed light on what everyone
seems obsessed with.

Let’s be challenged, and encouraged.

“The reason why I hate attending lessons and going to school is that
you are inherently born with lower IQ, so no matter how much you work,
people with higher IQ will still win you.”

No matter how hard we work—or how talented we believe ourselves to
be—it seems that there will be someone who will surpass our abilities
or achievements.



It would be all too easy for me to sit here and say, “Give up
everything for God. Don’t chase the success of the world. Don’t be so
career-minded.” That’s what I used to imagine myself telling
others—until I faced the dilemma myself.



Since young, I’ve had the privilege of having friends with brilliant
minds who went on to achieve enviable success in school and at work.
Many of them graduated from prestigious schools and are now holding
well-paying positions as computer engineers, doctors, lawyers, judges,
and financial experts. Some even went on to do their doctorates at
well-known institutions and are now doing research or teaching at
leading universities.

When I think of them, I notice that they have one thing in common:
every single one of them is earnest, diligent, disciplined, and
persevering.
