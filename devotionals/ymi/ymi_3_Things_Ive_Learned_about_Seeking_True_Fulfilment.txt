3 Things I’ve Learned about Seeking True Fulfilment

In this materialistic age, we often equate success with attaining
status, wealth, and power. For some, material success is the means to
attaining self-actualization. According to Maslow’s “Hierarchy of
Needs”, self-actualization is about realizing one’s full potential,
and is the top level of needs after other needs are
satisfied—physiological, safety, love, and self-esteem. It is the
desire to accomplish everything that one can, and to become the most
that one can be.

But have we confined this idea of self-actualization to an empty and
selfish material pursuit? As Christians, have we also made pleasure
our primary goal in life?

My personal path to self-actualization started with a desire for
material possessions, but by the grace of God, it evolved into a
thirst for peace which only God was able to provide (John 14:27), and
a desire to fulfill His will—and not my wishes—in my life.

While I know that God does not prohibit us from getting wealthy—He
endowed riches on people like Job, Joseph, and Solomon—He has taught
me some things in my journey towards seeking true fulfilment in my
life:

I am thus convinced that it is only in God that I can attain self-
actualization, just as John 15:5 states, “I am the vine; you are the
branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit;
apart from me you can do nothing.”

My true calling is to serve God’s purpose; happiness and serenity will
then follow.
