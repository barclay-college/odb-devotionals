5 Things I Learned When I Couldn’t Find A Job

Author: by Contributor

I was unemployed for almost a whole year. Over that period, I faced
rejection after rejection, so much so that I grew accustomed to
disappointment. At the time, I kept asking myself this question: what
am I going to do with my life? It was a frustrating and depressing
period, and it tested my faith in the Lord.

Looking back on it, however, I now realize that that one year was a
period of growth and unexpected blessings that I really needed in my
life.

So if you’re now in the position that I once was, here are the five
things I learned which will hopefully encourage you.

As I look back on the time when I didn’t have a job, I’m amazed by how
God has seen me through each step of the journey. And whatever
unforeseen plans He has for me in the future, I have confidence and
trust in Him that He will see me through once again. It is my prayer
that even after getting a job, I will not forget the lessons I’ve
learned.
