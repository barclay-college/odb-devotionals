Face in the Crowd (Your Everyday Hero)

Author: by Contributor

Written By Chia Poh Fang, Singapore

Look. It’s her again. Almost lost. Almost invisible A ho-hum existence
In the sea of dull faces.

Nothing special Nothing outstanding Just another face in the crowd.

She floats pass the mall She drifts pass the stall What’s the meaning
of it all?

Nothing special Nothing outstanding Just another face in the crowd.

When things seem so plain It’s often not so sane And here’s what the
plain Jane has to say, Borrowing the words of Edward Everett Hale:

I am only one But still I am one I cannot do everything But still I
can do something And because I cannot do everything I will not refuse
to do the something that I can do.
