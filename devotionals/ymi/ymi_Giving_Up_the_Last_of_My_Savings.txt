Giving Up the Last of My Savings

Author: by Contributor

Written By Ethan Wong, Malaysia

I was attending church one Sunday, and it was time for our offerings
to be collected. Usually, I don’t have much money—sometimes, none. But
this week, I felt different. It was as if God wanted me to do
something. I looked into my wallet, and discovered that there was just
one dollar inside.

It was all I had, but remembering the biblical story of the poor widow
who gave all she had to the temple (Luke 21:1–4), I took out the
dollar and put it in the offering. It was the last of my savings.

Shortly after, a friend sitting in front of me turned around. I hadn’t
noticed that she was there earlier. She told me,

“Hey, I just remembered, I owe you one buck.”

That’s when I realized that God was showing me something. The incident
may have sounded like a small matter, but it inspired me. It made me
remember all the blessings that God has given me. God wants us to give
up to Him what we hold most valuable. In return, He has promised that
He will always provide for us.

On that day, God told me, “Ethan, giving doesn’t make you poor,
because I am there to provide for you. Don’t be afraid.”
