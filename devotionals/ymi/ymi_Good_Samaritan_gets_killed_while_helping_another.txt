Good Samaritan gets killed while helping another

A man offers help to another, but in the process, gets shot by the
latter and dies. Talk about injustice.

But that’s exactly what happened last Friday (22 January) in Catawba
County, North Carolina, U.S.

When 26-year-old Jefferson Heavner saw a car stuck in the snow, he
stopped his pick-up truck to help the stranded driver, Marvin Jacob
Lee, 27. Upon realizing that Lee was drunk, Heavner, along with
several other motorists who had stopped, decided to call the police
and let them handle the situation.

But Lee apparently became belligerent, drew a gun and opened fire on
the group. While the rest managed to escape, Heavner was hit. Lee then
walked up to him and fired more shots into him. Heavner was pronounced
dead at the scene.

It’s hard to feel anything but outrage—and rightly so, because
everything about this case is wrong.

One, Lee shouldn’t have driven while he was drunk, but he did.

Two, Heavner didn’t need to stop to help, but he did. He was, in his
sister’s words, “always willing to help out in situations like this”.

Three, Heavner should have been rewarded for his kindness, but he
wasn’t. Instead, Heavner was killed—by the very person he was trying
to help.

And if you think that’s bad enough, there’s more. Heavner is a single
dad and leaves behind a 17-month-old son.

If you’re wondering how such a senseless crime can take place, here’s
something to think about: It’s not the first time. Doesn’t Heavner’s
death remind you of someone else? Someone who suffered the same fate
because he wanted to help us while we were in a fix, and whom we
pushed away, preferring to continue wallowing in our sorry state?

Our sins cost Him his life.

He died, to save us from our sins.

He died, so that we can break free from the power of sin.

Do we feel outrage over his death too?
