Poem: What is Life All About?

Author: by Contributor

Originally in Simplified Chinese by Chao Xue, Hebei, China Translated
by Shawn Quah, Singapore

Dreaming, unfettered and free, I recalled my daily existence. From
days past to lifeâ€™s sunset, Memories mingled with regrets, Is this all
that I can expect?

What have I paid in all my toil, Riches that did not truly satisfy.
Left behind, when all is deceased, What then, does it mean to live? Is
this all that life has to give?

Days turn to nights, summer to winter, A vicious cycle, as each day
passes. With passions gone, dreams fall out, Its beginning and end,
left in doubt, Tell me, what is life all about?
