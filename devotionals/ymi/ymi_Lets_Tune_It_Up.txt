Let’s Tune It Up!

The radio is an amazing machine. It comes in many forms: some are
huge, some are small; some advanced, some not. And they can be found
anywhere in the world, even the poorest country in the world has one.
Notice that no matter how old the radio is, all you need to do is to
adjust its antenna and find a radio frequency and all of a sudden, you
can listen to music and news any time. Isn’t that amazing?

In a sense, humans are like “radios.” Just as there are many types of
radios, there are many types of people—old or young, rich or poor,
introverted or extroverted, girl or boy, good or bad, literate or
illiterate. And regardless of all these, we can all take time to know
and listen to God.

God promises that we can find His “frequency” as long as we put in
effort to “adjust our antennas”! It’s like what Jeremiah 29:13 says,
“You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart”
(ESV).
