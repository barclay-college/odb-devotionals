Editor’s Picks: Top 3 Articles | Idealism

Author: by YMI

“If only we had this or that.”

How many times does that thought cross our minds every day?

In life, we have many expectations. But they don’t always match up
with reality, so we end up wishing and praying for things we don’t
have.

Perhaps we’re obsessed with finding “the one” to spend the rest of our
lives with. Or perhaps we’re unhappy with our family and secretly wish
we were born into a different one. Or maybe we always dreamed of doing
or achieving something but things just didn’t go according to plan.

What do you daydream about every day? Is there something eating at you
daily? Have you ever stopped to ask, why?

This month, let’s talk about our expectations, wishes and dreams. It’s
time to get real, people.

Somewhere out there is my Mr. Right. When I find him, I will be whole
and happy. I bought this lie. And I don’t think I’m the only one. As
the rising numbers of broken families and failed marriages attest,
many of us have bought into the fantasy of “the right one” as
portrayed in numerous books and movies.



Have you ever had wishes, desires, and dreams? Have you ever written
down the things you really want to achieve by a certain point in your
life? Have you ever found out that some dreams will never come true,
and some wishes are simply impossible to reach? I have.



Many of us have our own image of what our ideal family should look
like. Maybe it’s a traditional one, where the husband brings home the
bacon while his wife looks after their young children. Or maybe it’s a
DINK (Dual Income, No Kids). Or maybe it’s one with lots and lots of
children, so you can shower them all with your love. Unfortunately, we
live in a fallen world.
