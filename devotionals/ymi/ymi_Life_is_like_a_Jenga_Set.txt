Life is like a Jenga Set

Written By Chia Poh Fang

Life is like a Jenga set. There is a fixed number of time blocks to
each day. 24 hours to be exact, 1440 minutes in detail. Nothing more.
Nothing less. It is a fixed asset that we have to juggle daily. We all
play the game. Every hour. Every day.

We divide our day into fixed time blocks. 30 seconds for us to cross
the roads. 5 minutes for the train to arrive. 1 hour to grab a quick
bite, and chitchat with colleagues. 9 hours of work, 7 hours of sleep.

We move time blocks around and put them in new places. But once a time
block is shifted, another part of our life is affected. This adds
pressure on some time blocks, but loosens up others. No time block
stands solitary on its own; each will inevitably affect the others.

There’s an inherent problem in managing time like a Jenga game. The
game deludes us into thinking that we are building, When it is
actually about destroying. It is a game that undermines the
foundation, And as the game proceeds, time becomes a tougher balancing
act to keep.

Let’s change the rules of the game. Instead of taking out time blocks
and stacking them back on the top, We should take them out to build a
new set. In this way, the game will continue and not end. So for each
time block that I take out, I can ask myself: Is it for constructive
purposes or is it destructive in nature? Am I using time wisely or am
I wasting time?





“Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making
the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.” —Ephesians
5:15-16
