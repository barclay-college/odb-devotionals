Leave Room for God

When it pleased God… —Galatians 1:15

As servants of God, we must learn to make room for Him— to give God
“elbow room.” We plan and figure and predict that this or that will
happen, but we forget to make room for God to come in as He chooses.
Would we be surprised if God came into our meeting or into our
preaching in a way we had never expected Him to come? Do not look for
God to come in a particular way, but do look for Him. The way to make
room for Him is to expect Him to come, but not in a certain way. No
matter how well we may know God, the great lesson to learn is that He
may break in at any minute. We tend to overlook this element of
surprise, yet God never works in any other way. Suddenly—God meets our
life “…when it pleased God….”

Keep your life so constantly in touch with God that His surprising
power can break through at any point. Live in a constant state of
expectancy, and leave room for God to come in as He decides.

By Oswald Chambers
