Held by the Grip of God

I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has
also laid hold of me. —Philippians 3:12

Never choose to be a worker for God, but once God has placed His call
on you, woe be to you if you “turn aside to the right hand or to the
left” (Deuteronomy 5:32). We are not here to work for God because we
have chosen to do so, but because God has “laid hold of” us. And once
He has done so, we never have this thought, “Well, I’m really not
suited for this.” What you are to preach is also determined by God,
not by your own natural leanings or desires. Keep your soul
steadfastly related to God, and remember that you are called not
simply to convey your testimony but also to preach the gospel. Every
Christian must testify to the truth of God, but when it comes to the
call to preach, there must be the agonizing grip of God’s hand on you—
your life is in the grip of God for that very purpose. How many of us
are held like that?

Never water down the Word of God, but preach it in its undiluted
sternness. There must be unflinching faithfulness to the Word of God,
but when you come to personal dealings with others, remember who you
are— you are not some special being created in heaven, but a sinner
saved by grace.

“Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended; but one thing I
do…I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in
Christ Jesus” (Philippians 3:13-14).
