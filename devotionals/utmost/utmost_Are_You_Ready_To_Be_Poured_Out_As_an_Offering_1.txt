Are You Ready To Be Poured Out As an Offering? (1)

If I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and
service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.
—Philippians 2:17

Are you willing to sacrifice yourself for the work of another
believer—to pour out your life sacrificially for the ministry and
faith of others? Or do you say, “I am not willing to be poured out
right now, and I don’t want God to tell me how to serve Him. I want to
choose the place of my own sacrifice. And I want to have certain
people watching me and saying, ‘Well done.’ ”

It is one thing to follow God’s way of service if you are regarded as
a hero, but quite another thing if the road marked out for you by God
requires becoming a “doormat” under other people’s feet. God’s purpose
may be to teach you to say, “I know how to be abased…” (Philippians
4:12). Are you ready to be sacrificed like that? Are you ready to be
less than a mere drop in the bucket— to be so totally insignificant
that no one remembers you even if they think of those you served? Are
you willing to give and be poured out until you are used up and
exhausted— not seeking to be ministered to, but to minister? Some
saints cannot do menial work while maintaining a saintly attitude,
because they feel such service is beneath their dignity.
