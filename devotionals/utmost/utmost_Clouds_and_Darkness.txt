Clouds and Darkness

Clouds and darkness surround Him… —Psalm 97:2

A person who has not been born again by the Spirit of God will tell
you that the teachings of Jesus are simple. But when he is baptized by
the Holy Spirit, he finds that “clouds and darkness surround Him….”
When we come into close contact with the teachings of Jesus Christ we
have our first realization of this. The only possible way to have full
understanding of the teachings of Jesus is through the light of the
Spirit of God shining inside us. If we have never had the experience
of taking our casual, religious shoes off our casual, religious feet—
getting rid of all the excessive informality with which we approach
God— it is questionable whether we have ever stood in His presence.
The people who are flippant and disrespectful in their approach to God
are those who have never been introduced to Jesus Christ. Only after
the amazing delight and liberty of realizing what Jesus Christ does,
comes the impenetrable “darkness” of realizing who He is.

Jesus said, “The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are
life” (John 6:63). Once, the Bible was just so many words to us —
“clouds and darkness”— then, suddenly, the words become spirit and
life because Jesus re-speaks them to us when our circumstances make
the words new. That is the way God speaks to us; not by visions and
dreams, but by words. When a man gets to God, it is by the most simple
way— words.
