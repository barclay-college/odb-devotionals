Liberty and the Standards of Jesus

Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free…
—Galatians 5:1

A spiritually-minded person will never come to you with the demand—
“Believe this and that”; a spiritually-minded person will demand that
you align your life with the standards of Jesus. We are not asked to
believe the Bible, but to believe the One whom the Bible reveals
(see John 5:39-40). We are called to present liberty for the
conscience of others, not to bring them liberty for their thoughts and
opinions. And if we ourselves are free with the liberty of Christ,
others will be brought into that same liberty— the liberty that comes
from realizing the absolute control and authority of Jesus Christ.

Always measure your life solely by the standards of Jesus. Submit
yourself to His yoke, and His alone; and always be careful never to
place a yoke on others that is not of Jesus Christ. It takes God a
long time to get us to stop thinking that unless everyone sees things
exactly as we do, they must be wrong. That is never God’s view. There
is only one true liberty— the liberty of Jesus at work in our
conscience enabling us to do what is right.

Don’t get impatient with others. Remember how God dealt with you— with
patience and with gentleness. But never water down the truth of God.
Let it have its way and never apologize for it. Jesus said, “Go…and
make disciples…” (Matthew 28:19), not, “Make converts to your own
thoughts and opinions.”
