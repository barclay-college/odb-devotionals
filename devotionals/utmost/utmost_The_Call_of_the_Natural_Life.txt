The Call of the Natural Life

When it pleased God…to reveal His Son in me… —Galatians 1:15-16

The call of God is not a call to serve Him in any particular way. My
contact with the nature of God will shape my understanding of His call
and will help me realize what I truly desire to do for Him. The call
of God is an expression of His nature; the service which results in my
life is suited to me and is an expression of my nature. The call of
the natural life was stated by the apostle Paul— “When it pleased
God…to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him [that is, purely
and solemnly express Him] among the Gentiles….”

Service is the overflow which pours from a life filled with love and
devotion. But strictly speaking, there is no call to that. Service is
what I bring to the relationship and is the reflection of my
identification with the nature of God. Service becomes a natural part
of my life. God brings me into the proper relationship with Himself so
that I can understand His call, and then I serve Him on my own out of
a motivation of absolute love. Service to God is the deliberate love-
gift of a nature that has heard the call of God. Service is an
expression of my nature, and God’s call is an expression of His
nature. Therefore, when I receive His nature and hear His call, His
divine voice resounds throughout His nature and mine and the two
become one in service. The Son of God reveals Himself in me, and out
of devotion to Him service becomes my everyday way of life.
