Taking the Next Step

…in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses. —2
Corinthians 6:4

When you have no vision from God, no enthusiasm left in your life, and
no one watching and encouraging you, it requires the grace of Almighty
God to take the next step in your devotion to Him, in the reading and
studying of His Word, in your family life, or in your duty to Him. It
takes much more of the grace of God, and a much greater awareness of
drawing upon Him, to take that next step, than it does to preach the
gospel.

Every Christian must experience the essence of the incarnation by
bringing the next step down into flesh-and-blood reality and by
working it out with his hands. We lose interest and give up when we
have no vision, no encouragement, and no improvement, but only
experience our everyday life with its trivial tasks. The thing that
really testifies for God and for the people of God in the long run is
steady perseverance, even when the work cannot be seen by others. And
the only way to live an undefeated life is to live looking to God. Ask
God to keep the eyes of your spirit open to the risen Christ, and it
will be impossible for drudgery to discourage you. Never allow
yourself to think that some tasks are beneath your dignity or too
insignificant for you to do, and remind yourself of the example of
Christ inJohn 13:1-17.
