Our Careful Unbelief

…do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will
drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. —Matthew 6:25

Jesus summed up commonsense carefulness in the life of a disciple as
unbelief. If we have received the Spirit of God, He will squeeze right
through our lives, as if to ask, “Now where do I come into this
relationship, this vacation you have planned, or these new books you
want to read?” And He always presses the point until we learn to make
Him our first consideration. Whenever we put other things first, there
is confusion.

“…do not worry about your life….” Don’t take the pressure of your
provision upon yourself. It is not only wrong to worry, it is
unbelief; worrying means we do not believe that God can look after the
practical details of our lives, and it is never anything but those
details that worry us. Have you ever noticed what Jesus said would
choke the Word He puts in us? Is it the devil? No— “the cares of this
world” (Matthew 13:22). It is always our little worries. We say, “I
will not trust when I cannot see”— and that is where unbelief begins.
The only cure for unbelief is obedience to the Spirit.

The greatest word of Jesus to His disciples is abandon.
