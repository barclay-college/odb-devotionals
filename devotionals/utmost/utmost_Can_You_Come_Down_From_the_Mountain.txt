Can You Come Down From the Mountain?

While you have the light, believe in the light… —John 12:36

We all have moments when we feel better than ever before, and we say,
“I feel fit for anything; if only I could always be like this!” We are
not meant to be. Those moments are moments of insight which we have to
live up to even when we do not feel like it. Many of us are no good
for the everyday world when we are not on the mountaintop. Yet we must
bring our everyday life up to the standard revealed to us on the
mountaintop when we were there.

Never allow a feeling that was awakened in you on the mountaintop to
evaporate. Don’t place yourself on the shelf by thinking, “How great
to be in such a wonderful state of mind!” Act immediately— do
something, even if your only reason to act is that you would rather
not. If, during a prayer meeting, God shows you something to do, don’t
say, “I’ll do it”— just do it! Pick yourself up by the back of the
neck and shake off your fleshly laziness. Laziness can always be seen
in our cravings for a mountaintop experience; all we talk about is our
planning for our time on the mountain. We must learn to live in the
ordinary “gray” day according to what we saw on the mountain.

Don’t give up because you have been blocked and confused once— go
after it again. Burn your bridges behind you, and stand committed to
God by an act of your own will. Never change your decisions, but be
sure to make your decisions in the light of what you saw and learned
on the mountain.

By Oswald Chambers
