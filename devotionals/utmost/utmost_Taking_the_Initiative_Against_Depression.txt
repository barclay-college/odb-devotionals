Taking the Initiative Against Depression

Arise and eat. —1 Kings 19:5

The angel in this passage did not give Elijah a vision, or explain the
Scriptures to him, or do anything remarkable. He simply told Elijah to
do a very ordinary thing, that is, to get up and eat. If we were never
depressed, we would not be alive— only material things don’t suffer
depression. If human beings were not capable of depression, we would
have no capacity for happiness and exaltation. There are things in
life that are designed to depress us; for example, things that are
associated with death. Whenever you examine yourself, always take into
account your capacity for depression.

When the Spirit of God comes to us, He does not give us glorious
visions, but He tells us to do the most ordinary things imaginable.
Depression tends to turn us away from the everyday things of God’s
creation. But whenever God steps in, His inspiration is to do the most
natural, simple things— things we would never have imagined God was
in, but as we do them we find Him there. The inspiration that comes to
us in this way is an initiative against depression. But we must take
the first step and do it in the inspiration of God. If, however, we do
something simply to overcome our depression, we will only deepen it.
But when the Spirit of God leads us instinctively to do something, the
moment we do it the depression is gone. As soon as we arise and obey,
we enter a higher plane of life.
