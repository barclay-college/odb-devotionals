The Miracle of Belief

My speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human
wisdom… —1 Corinthians 2:4

Paul was a scholar and an orator of the highest degree; he was not
speaking here out of a deep sense of humility, but was saying that
when he preached the gospel, he would veil the power of God if he
impressed people with the excellency of his speech. Belief in Jesus is
a miracle produced only by the effectiveness of redemption, not by
impressive speech, nor by wooing and persuading, but only by the sheer
unaided power of God. The creative power of redemption comes through
the preaching of the gospel, but never because of the personality of
the preacher.

Real and effective fasting by a preacher is not fasting from food, but
fasting from eloquence, from impressive diction, and from everything
else that might hinder the gospel of God being presented. The preacher
is there as the representative of God— “…as though God were pleading
through us…” (2 Corinthians 5:20). He is there to present the gospel
of God. If it is only because of my preaching that people desire to be
better, they will never get close to Jesus Christ. Anything that
flatters me in my preaching of the gospel will result in making me a
traitor to Jesus, and I prevent the creative power of His redemption
from doing its work.

“And I, if I am lifted up…, will draw all peoples to Myself” (John
12:32).
