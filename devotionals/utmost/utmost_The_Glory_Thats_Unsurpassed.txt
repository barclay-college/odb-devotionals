The Glory That’s Unsurpassed

…the Lord Jesus…has sent me that you may receive your sight… —Acts
9:17

When Paul received his sight, he also received spiritual insight into
the Person of Jesus Christ. His entire life and preaching from that
point on were totally consumed with nothing but Jesus Christ— “For I
determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him
crucified” (1 Corinthians 2:2). Paul never again allowed anything to
attract and hold the attention of his mind and soul except the face of
Jesus Christ.

We must learn to maintain a strong degree of character in our lives,
even to the level that has been revealed in our vision of Jesus
Christ.

The lasting characteristic of a spiritual man is the ability to
understand correctly the meaning of the Lord Jesus Christ in his life,
and the ability to explain the purposes of God to others. The
overruling passion of his life is Jesus Christ. Whenever you see this
quality in a person, you get the feeling that he is truly a man after
God’s own heart (see Acts 13:22).

Never allow anything to divert you from your insight into Jesus
Christ. It is the true test of whether you are spiritual or not. To be
unspiritual means that other things have a growing fascination for
you.

Since mine eyes have looked on Jesus, I’ve lost sight of all beside,
So enchained my spirit’s vision, Gazing on the Crucified.

By Oswald Chambers
