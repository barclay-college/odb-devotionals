Am I Looking To God?

Look to Me, and be saved… —Isaiah 45:22

Do we expect God to come to us with His blessings and save us? He
says, “Look to Me, and be saved….” The greatest difficulty spiritually
is to concentrate on God, and His blessings are what make it so
difficult. Troubles almost always make us look to God, but His
blessings tend to divert our attention elsewhere. The basic lesson of
the Sermon on the Mount is to narrow all your interests until your
mind, heart, and body are focused on Jesus Christ. “Look to Me….”

Many of us have a mental picture of what a Christian should be, and
looking at this image in other Christians’ lives becomes a hindrance
to our focusing on God. This is not salvation— it is not simple
enough. He says, in effect, “Look to Me and you are saved,” not “You
will be saved someday.” We will find what we are looking for if we
will concentrate on Him. We get distracted from God and irritable with
Him while He continues to say to us, “Look to Me, and be saved….” Our
difficulties, our trials, and our worries about tomorrow all vanish
when we look to God.

Wake yourself up and look to God. Build your hope on Him. No matter
how many things seem to be pressing in on you, be determined to push
them aside and look to Him. “Look to Me….” Salvation is yours the
moment you look.
