Taking the Initiative Against Daydreaming

Arise, let us go from here. —John 14:31

Daydreaming about something in order to do it properly is right, but
daydreaming about it when we should be doing it is wrong. In this
passage, after having said these wonderful things to His disciples, we
might have expected our Lord to tell them to go away and meditate over
them all. But Jesus never allowed idle daydreaming. When our purpose
is to seek God and to discover His will for us, daydreaming is right
and acceptable. But when our inclination is to spend time daydreaming
over what we have already been told to do, it is unacceptable and
God’s blessing is never on it. God will take the initiative against
this kind of daydreaming by prodding us to action. His instructions to
us will be along the lines of this: “Don’t sit or stand there, just
go!”

If we are quietly waiting before God after He has said to us, “Come
aside by yourselves…” then that is meditation before Him to seek His
will (Mark 6:31). Beware, however, of giving in to mere daydreaming
once God has spoken. Allow Him to be the source of all your dreams,
joys, and delights, and be careful to go and obey what He has said. If
you are in love with someone, you don’t sit and daydream about that
person all the time— you go and do something for him. That is what
Jesus Christ expects us to do. Daydreaming after God has spoken is an
indication that we do not trust Him.
