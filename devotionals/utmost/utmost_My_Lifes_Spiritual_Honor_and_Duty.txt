My Life’s Spiritual Honor and Duty

I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians… —Romans 1:14

Paul was overwhelmed with the sense of his indebtedness to Jesus
Christ, and he spent his life to express it. The greatest inspiration
in Paul’s life was his view of Jesus Christ as his spiritual creditor.
Do I feel that same sense of indebtedness to Christ regarding every
unsaved soul? As a saint, my life’s spiritual honor and duty is to
fulfill my debt to Christ in relation to these lost souls. Every tiny
bit of my life that has value I owe to the redemption of Jesus Christ.
Am I doing anything to enable Him to bring His redemption into evident
reality in the lives of others? I will only be able to do this as the
Spirit of God works into me this sense of indebtedness.

I am not a superior person among other people— I am a bondservant of
the Lord Jesus. Paul said, “…you are not your own…you were bought at a
price…” (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Paul sold himself to Jesus Christ and
he said, in effect, “I am a debtor to everyone on the face of the
earth because of the gospel of Jesus; I am free only that I may be an
absolute bondservant of His.” That is the characteristic of a
Christian’s life once this level of spiritual honor and duty becomes
real. Quit praying about yourself and spend your life for the sake of
others as the bondservant of Jesus. That is the true meaning of being
broken bread and poured-out wine in real life.
