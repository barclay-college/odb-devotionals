“It Is the Lord!”

Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!" —John 20:28

“Jesus said to her, ‘Give Me a drink’ ” (John 4:7). How many of us are
expecting Jesus Christ to quench our thirst when we should be
satisfying Him! We should be pouring out our lives, investing our
total beings, not drawing on Him to satisfy us. “You shall be
witnesses to Me…” (Acts 1:8). That means lives of pure,
uncompromising, and unrestrained devotion to the Lord Jesus, which
will be satisfying to Him wherever He may send us.

Beware of anything that competes with your loyalty to Jesus Christ.
The greatest competitor of true devotion to Jesus is the service we do
for Him. It is easier to serve than to pour out our lives completely
for Him. The goal of the call of God is His satisfaction, not simply
that we should do something for Him. We are not sent to do battle for
God, but to be used by God in His battles. Are we more devoted to
service than we are to Jesus Christ Himself?
