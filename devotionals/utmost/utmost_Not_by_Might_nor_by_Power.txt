“Not by Might nor by Power”

My speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human
wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power… —1
Corinthians 2:4

If in preaching the gospel you substitute your knowledge of the way of
salvation for confidence in the power of the gospel, you hinder people
from getting to reality. Take care to see while you proclaim your
knowledge of the way of salvation, that you yourself are rooted and
grounded by faith in God. Never rely on the clearness of your
presentation, but as you give your explanation make sure that you are
relying on the Holy Spirit. Rely on the certainty of God’s redemptive
power, and He will create His own life in people.

Once you are rooted in reality, nothing can shake you. If your faith
is in experiences, anything that happens is likely to upset that
faith. But nothing can ever change God or the reality of redemption.
Base your faith on that, and you are as eternally secure as God
Himself. Once you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, you
will never be moved again. That is the meaning of sanctification. God
disapproves of our human efforts to cling to the concept that
sanctification is merely an experience, while forgetting that even our
sanctification must also be sanctified (see John 17:19). I must
deliberately give my sanctified life to God for His service, so that
He can use me as His hands and His feet.
