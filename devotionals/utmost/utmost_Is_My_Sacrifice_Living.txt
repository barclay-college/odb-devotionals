Is My Sacrifice Living?

Abraham built an altar…; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on
the altar… —Genesis 22:9

This event is a picture of the mistake we make in thinking that the
ultimate God wants of us is the sacrifice of death. What God wants is
the sacrifice through death which enables us to do what Jesus did,
that is, sacrifice our lives. Not— “Lord, I am ready to go with You…to
death” (Luke 22:33). But— “I am willing to be identified with Your
death so that I may sacrifice my life to God.”

We seem to think that God wants us to give up things! God purified
Abraham from this error, and the same process is at work in our lives.
God never tells us to give up things just for the sake of giving them
up, but He tells us to give them up for the sake of the only thing
worth having, namely, life with Himself. It is a matter of loosening
the bands that hold back our lives. Those bands are loosened
immediately by identification with the death of Jesus. Then we enter
into a relationship with God whereby we may sacrifice our lives to
Him.

It is of no value to God to give Him your life for death. He wants you
to be a “living sacrifice”— to let Him have all your strengths that
have been saved and sanctified through Jesus (Romans 12:1). This is
what is acceptable to God.
