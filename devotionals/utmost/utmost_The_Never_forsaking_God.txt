The Never-forsaking God

He Himself has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."
—Hebrews 13:5

What line of thinking do my thoughts take? Do I turn to what God says
or to my own fears? Am I simply repeating what God says, or am I
learning to truly hear Him and then to respond after I have heard what
He says? “For He Himself has said, ‘I will never leave you nor forsake
you.’ So we may boldly say: ‘The Lord is my helper; I will not fear.
What can man do to me?’ ” (Hebrews 13:5-6).

“I will never leave you…”— not for any reason; not my sin,
selfishness, stubbornness, nor waywardness. Have I really let God say
to me that He will never leave me? If I have not truly heard this
assurance of God, then let me listen again.

“I will never…forsake you.” Sometimes it is not the difficulty of life
but the drudgery of it that makes me think God will forsake me. When
there is no major difficulty to overcome, no vision from God, nothing
wonderful or beautiful— just the everyday activities of life— do I
hear God’s assurance even in these?

We have the idea that God is going to do some exceptional thing— that
He is preparing and equipping us for some extraordinary work in the
future. But as we grow in His grace we find that God is glorifying
Himself here and now, at this very moment. If we have God’s assurance
behind us, the most amazing strength becomes ours, and we learn to
sing, glorifying Him even in the ordinary days and ways of life.
