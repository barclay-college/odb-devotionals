All or Nothing?

When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer
garment…and plunged into the sea. —John 21:7

Have you ever had a crisis in your life in which you deliberately,
earnestly, and recklessly abandoned everything? It is a crisis of the
will. You may come to that point many times externally, but it will
amount to nothing. The true deep crisis of abandonment, or total
surrender, is reached internally, not externally. The giving up of
only external things may actually be an indication of your being in
total bondage.

Have you deliberately committed your will to Jesus Christ? It is a
transaction of the will, not of emotion; any positive emotion that
results is simply a superficial blessing arising out of the
transaction. If you focus your attention on the emotion, you will
never make the transaction. Do not ask God what the transaction is to
be, but make the determination to surrender your will regarding
whatever you see, whether it is in the shallow or the deep, profound
places internally.

If you have heard Jesus Christ’s voice on the waves of the sea, you
can let your convictions and your consistency take care of themselves
by concentrating on maintaining your intimate relationship to Him.

By Oswald Chambers
