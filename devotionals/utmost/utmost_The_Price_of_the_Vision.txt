The Price of the Vision

In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord… —Isaiah 6:1

Our soul’s personal history with God is often an account of the death
of our heroes. Over and over again God has to remove our friends to
put Himself in their place, and that is when we falter, fail, and
become discouraged. Let me think about this personally— when the
person died who represented for me all that God was, did I give up on
everything in life? Did I become ill or disheartened? Or did I do as
Isaiah did and see the Lord?

My vision of God is dependent upon the condition of my character. My
character determines whether or not truth can even be revealed to me.
Before I can say, “I saw the Lord,” there must be something in my
character that conforms to the likeness of God. Until I am born again
and really begin to see the kingdom of God, I only see from the
perspective of my own biases. What I need is God’s surgical procedure—
His use of external circumstances to bring about internal
purification.

Your priorities must be God first, God second, and God third, until
your life is continually face to face with God and no one else is
taken into account whatsoever. Your prayer will then be, “In all the
world there is no one but You, dear God; there is no one but You.”

Keep paying the price. Let God see that you are willing to live up to
the vision.
