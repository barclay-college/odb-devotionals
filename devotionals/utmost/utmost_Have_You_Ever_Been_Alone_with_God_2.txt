Have You Ever Been Alone with God? (2)

When He was alone…the twelve asked Him about the parable. —Mark 4:10

His Solitude with Us. When God gets us alone through suffering,
heartbreak, temptation, disappointment, sickness, or by thwarted
desires, a broken friendship, or a new friendship— when He gets us
absolutely alone, and we are totally speechless, unable to ask even
one question, then He begins to teach us. Notice Jesus Christ’s
training of the Twelve. It was the disciples, not the crowd outside,
who were confused. His disciples constantly asked Him questions, and
He constantly explained things to them, but they didn’t understand
until after they received the Holy Spirit (see John 14:26).

As you journey with God, the only thing He intends to be clear is the
way He deals with your soul. The sorrows and difficulties in the lives
of others will be absolutely confusing to you. We think we understand
another person’s struggle until God reveals the same shortcomings in
our lives. There are vast areas of stubbornness and ignorance the Holy
Spirit has to reveal in each of us, but it can only be done when Jesus
gets us alone. Are we alone with Him now? Or are we more concerned
with our own ideas, friendships, and cares for our bodies? Jesus
cannot teach us anything until we quiet all our intellectual questions
and get alone with Him.
