All Safe! All Well!

Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what
we do not see.
Hebrews 11:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 11:8-16

In January 1915, the ship Endurance was trapped and crushed in the ice
off the coast of Antarctica. The group of polar explorers, led by
Ernest Shackleton, survived and managed to reach Elephant Island in
three small lifeboats. Trapped on this uninhabited island, far from
normal shipping lanes, they had one hope. On April 24, 1916, 22 men
watched as Shackleton and five comrades set out in a tiny lifeboat for
South Georgia, an island 800 miles away. The odds seemed impossible,
and if they failed, they would all certainly die. What joy, then, when
more than four months later a boat appeared on the horizon with
Shackleton on its bow shouting, “Are you all well?” And the call came
back, “All safe! All well!”

What held those men together and kept them alive over those months?
Faith and hope placed in one man. They believed that Shackleton would
find a way to save them.

This human example of faith and hope echoes the faith of the heroes
listed in Hebrews 11. Their faith in the “substance of things hoped
for, the evidence of things not seen” kept them going through great
difficulties and trials (Heb. 11:1 nkjv).

As we look out upon the horizon of our own problems, may we not
despair. May we have hope through the certainty of our faith in the
One Man—Jesus, our God and Savior.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, for the promise of forgiveness made possible by
Jesus. May that promise lighten the darkest of our days.

The hope of Jesus shines brightly even on our darkest day.
