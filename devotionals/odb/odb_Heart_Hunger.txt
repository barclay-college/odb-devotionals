Heart Hunger

I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and
whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
John 6:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 6:32–40

Riding along with my husband on some errands, I scrolled through
emails on my phone and was surprised at an incoming advertisement for
a local donut shop, a shop we had just passed on the right side of the
street. Suddenly my stomach growled with hunger. I marveled at how
technology allows vendors to woo us into their establishments.

As I clicked off my email, I mused over God’s constant yearning to
draw me closer. He always knows where I am and longs to influence my
choices. I wondered, Does my heart growl in desire for Him the way my
stomach did over the idea of a donut?

In John 6, following the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, the
disciples eagerly ask Jesus to always give them “the bread that . . .
gives life to the world” (vv. 33–34). Jesus responds in verse 35, “I
am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry and
whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.” How amazing that a
relationship with Jesus can provide constant nourishment in our
everyday lives!

The donut shop’s advertisement targeted my body’s craving, but God’s
continuous knowledge of my heart’s condition invites me to recognize
my ongoing need for Him and to receive the sustenance only He can
provide.
