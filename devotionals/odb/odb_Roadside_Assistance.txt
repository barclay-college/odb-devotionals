Roadside Assistance

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. —
Psalm 46:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 46

An acquaintance of mine was hunting with friends near Balmoral, the
country estate of the queen of England. As they walked, he twisted his
ankle so badly that he couldn’t go on, so he told his friends to
continue and he would wait by the side of the road.

As he sat there, a car came down the road, slowed, and stopped. The
woman driving rolled the window down and asked if he was okay. He
explained and said he was waiting for his friends to return. She said,
“Get in; I’ll take you back to where you are staying.” He limped to
the car and opened the door only to realize that it was Queen
Elizabeth!

As shocking as receiving help from the queen of England may be, we
have an offer of help that is even more astounding. The Creator-God of
the universe descends into our world, sees our trouble, and offers to
marshal His resources to help us. As the psalmist confidently affirms,
“God is . . . a very present help in trouble” (Ps. 46:1). Our Savior
helps by giving us grace to endure, His Word to sustain us, friends to
encourage and pray for us, and the confidence that He will ultimately
work it all together for our spiritual good.

Next time you feel stranded along life’s road, look for your Helper.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I’m thankful that when I experience trouble You are waiting and
wanting to help. Teach me to look to You and to rest in Your kind and
loving care until You deliver me safely home.

Rejoice! Your God is a helping King!
