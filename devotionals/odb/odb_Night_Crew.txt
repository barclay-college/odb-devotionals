Night Crew

Obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with
eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God. —
Colossians 3:22

Today's Scripture: Colossians 3:22-25

Pat’s first job was working on the night crew at a grocery store.
After closing time, he and the other employees stocked the shelves.
Pat’s boss had instructed them to always turn the soup cans forward so
that the label could be read easily. But he had gone a little further
by saying, “Make sure that they’re facing forward—three cans back.”
One night as Pat was arranging the shelves, his co-workers began to
scoff, “Just make sure the front can is turned the right way. Who’s
gonna know?”

It was a moment of decision for the teenager. Should he obey what his
boss had asked him to do, or just do what was easy?

We’ve all been in similar situations where we’ve had to make a choice.
The apostle Paul encouraged his fellow believers to be obedient even
when no one was watching: “Bondservants, obey in all things your
masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers,
but in sincerity of heart, fearing God” (Col. 3:22).

Doing the right thing should not be dependent on whether our employer
is around or if anyone else is watching. It’s not always easy or
convenient to be obedient. But it’s right.

Remember, “to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it
is sin” (James 4:17).

Our character is measured by what we do when no one is looking.
