The Problem with Pride

Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.
Proverbs 16:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 16:16–22

People who achieve an extraordinary level of fame or reputation while
they are still alive are often called “a legend in their own time.” A
friend who played professional baseball says he met many people in the
world of sports who were only “a legend in their own mind.” Pride has
a way of distorting how we see ourselves while humility offers a
realistic perspective.

The writer of Proverbs said, “Pride goes before destruction, a haughty
spirit before a fall” (16:18). Viewing ourselves in the mirror of
self-importance reflects a distorted image. Self-elevation positions
us for a fall.

The antidote to the poison of arrogance is true humility that comes
from God. “Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than
to share plunder with the proud” (v. 19).

Jesus told His disciples, “Whoever wants to become great among you
must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your
slave—just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,
and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:26–28).

There is nothing wrong with receiving accolades for achievement and
success. The challenge is to stay focused on the One who calls us to
follow Him saying, “for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will
find rest for your souls” (11:29).

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, give us Your humility as we interact with others today.
May we honor You in all we do and say.

True humility comes from God.
