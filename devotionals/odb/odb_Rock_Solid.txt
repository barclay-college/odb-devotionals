Rock-Solid

The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to
their cry. —
Psalm 34:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:15-22

It was a sad day in May 2003 when “The Old Man of the Mountain” broke
apart and slid down the mountainside. This 40-foot profile of an old
man’s face, carved by nature in the White Mountains of New Hampshire,
had long been an attraction to tourists, a solid presence for
residents, and the official state emblem. It was written about by
Nathaniel Hawthorne in his short story The Great Stone Face.

Some nearby residents were devastated when The Old Man fell. One woman
said, “I grew up thinking that someone was watching over me. I feel a
little less watched-over now.”

There are times when a dependable presence disappears. Something or
someone we’ve relied on is gone, and our life is shaken. Maybe it’s
the loss of a loved one, or a job, or good health. The loss makes us
feel off-balance, unstable. We might even think that God is no longer
watching over us.

But “the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open
to their cry” (Ps. 34:15). He “is near to those who have a broken
heart” (v.18). He is the Rock whose presence we can always depend on
(Deut. 32:4).

God’s presence is real. He continually watches over us. He is rock-
solid.

Reflect & Pray

The Rock of Ages stands secure, He always will be there; He watches
over all His own To calm their anxious care. —Keith

The question is not where is God, but where isn’t He?
