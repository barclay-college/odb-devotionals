Christmas Rest

Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened.
Matthew 11:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 11:28–12:8

As a boy I delivered newspapers in order to earn money. Since it was a
morning newspaper, I was required to get up at 3:00 every morning, 7
days a week, in order to have all 140 of my papers delivered to their
appropriate homes by 6:00 a.m.

But one day each year was different. We would deliver the Christmas
morning newspaper on Christmas Eve—meaning that Christmas was the only
morning of the year I could sleep in and rest like a normal person.

Over the years, I came to appreciate Christmas for many reasons, but
one that was special in those days was that, unlike any other day of
the year, it was a day of rest.

At that time, I didn’t fully understand the meaning of the true rest
that Christmas brings. Christ came so that all who labor under the
weight of a law that can never be fulfilled might find rest through
the forgiveness Christ offers. Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who
are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28). In a
world that is too much for us to bear alone, Christ has come to bring
us into a relationship with Him and give us rest.
