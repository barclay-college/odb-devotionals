Refreshing Candor

He who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, . .
. this one will be blessed in what he does. —
James 1:25

Today's Scripture: John 4:7-26

Of the many things I love about my mom, chief among them may be her
candor. Many times I have called to ask her opinion on a matter and
she has consistently responded, “Don’t ask my opinion unless you want
to hear it. I’m not going to try to figure out what you want to hear.
I’ll tell you what I really think.”

In a world where words are carefully parsed, her straightforwardness
is refreshing. It is also one of the characteristics of a true friend.
Real friends speak the truth to us in love—even if it isn’t what we
want to hear. As the proverb says, “Faithful are the wounds of a
friend” (Prov. 27:6).

This is one of the reasons Jesus is the greatest of friends. When He
encountered the woman at the well (John 4:7-26), He refused to be
pulled into a tug-of-war over secondary issues but instead drove to
the deepest issues and needs of her heart. He challenged her about the
character of the Father and lovingly spoke to her of her broken dreams
and deep disappointments.

As we walk with our Lord, may we allow Him to speak candidly to the
true condition of our hearts through the Scriptures—that we might turn
to Him and find His grace to help us in our times of need.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for sending Your Son to be my Savior and the
greatest of friends. Help me to learn from Him how loving honesty can
make a difference in helping the hurting people around me.

Jesus always tells us truth.
