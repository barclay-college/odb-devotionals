God’s Signature

God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. —
Genesis 1:31

Today's Scripture: Genesis 1:27-31

Displayed on the wall of my friends’ lake house is a collection of
pictures. Each one of the photos is of a sunset, taken from their deck
during various seasons. While each is strikingly beautiful—no two are
identical. When I look at them, it reminds me of what another friend
once called a sunset—“God’s beautiful signature at the end of a day.”

God writes His signature on each sunset and on each of His unique
children as well. I never grow tired of discovering how every person I
meet is so delightfully different. God is infinitely creative, and the
variety in our personalities, senses of humor, abilities, and
preferences in music and sports are all handcrafted by Him.

In the body of Christ, we see how a diversity of spiritual gifts still
have a common bond and can work together for God’s purposes to bring
Him glory. In 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, we read, “There are diversities of
gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but
the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the
same God who works all in all.”

God’s signature that is so evident in nature is also present in His
people. Let’s celebrate the differences that make each of His children
unique.

Reflect & Pray

In Jesus Christ we all are equal, For God’s Spirit makes us one; As we
give each other honor, We give glory to His Son. —Fitzhugh

The signature of God is seen on His creation.
