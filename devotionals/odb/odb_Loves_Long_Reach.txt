Love’s Long Reach

Oh, the depths of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
Romans 11:33

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:1–10

Mary Lee is a sixteen-foot, 3,500-pound great white shark tagged by
oceanographers off the east coast of the US in 2012. The transmitter
attached to her dorsal fin would be tracked by satellite when she
surfaced. For the next five years Mary Lee’s movements were observed
online by everyone from researchers to surfers, up and down the coast.
She was tracked for nearly 40,000 miles until one day her signal
stopped—probably because the battery on her transmitter expired.

Human knowledge and technology reach only so far. Those “following”
Mary Lee lost track of her, but you and I can never evade God’s
awareness throughout every moment of our lives. David prayed, “Where
can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I
go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths,
you are there” (Psalm 139:7–8). “Such knowledge is too wonderful for
me,” he exclaims gratefully (v. 6).

God chooses to know us because He loves us. He cares enough not only
to observe our lives but also to enter into them and make them new. He
drew near through Christ’s life, death, and resurrection, so we could
know Him in return and love Him for eternity. We can never go beyond
the reach of God’s love.

Reflect & Pray

How does the thought that God knows and loves us completely encourage
you? How will you reach out to others with His love today?

Thank You for always seeing me, Father! Help me to live today with a
growing awareness of Your presence and perfect love.
