The Secret of Peace

The Lord of peace himself give you peace.
2 Thessalonians 3:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Thessalonians 3:16–18

Grace is a very special lady. One word comes to mind when I think of
her: peace. The quiet and restful expression on her face has seldom
changed in the six months I have known her, even though her husband
was diagnosed with a rare disease and then hospitalized.

When I asked Grace the secret of her peace, she said, “It’s not a
secret, it’s a person. It’s Jesus in me. There is no other way I can
explain the quietness I feel in the midst of this storm.”

The secret of peace is our relationship to Jesus Christ. He is our
peace. When Jesus is our Savior and Lord, and as we become more like
Him, peace becomes real. Things like sickness, financial difficulties,
or danger may be present, but peace reassures us that God holds our
lives in His hands (Daniel 5:23), and we can trust that things will
work together for good.

Have we experienced this peace that goes beyond logic and
understanding? Do we have the inner confidence that God is in control?
My wish for all of us today echoes the words of the apostle Paul:
“May the Lord of peace himself give you peace.” And may we feel this
peace “at all times and in every way” (2 Thessalonians 3:16).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, please give us Your peace at all times and in every
situation.

To trust in Jesus is peace.
