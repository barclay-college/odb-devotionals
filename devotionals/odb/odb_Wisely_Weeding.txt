Wisely Weeding

Search me, God, and know my heart.
Psalm 139:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:1–6, 23–24

My grandchildren are running around my backyard. Playing games? No,
pulling weeds. “Pulling them up by the roots!” the youngest says,
showing me a hefty prize. Her delight as we tackled weeds that day was
how much we enjoyed plucking the weedy roots—clearing away each pesky
menace. Before the joy, however, came the choice to go after them.

Intentional weeding is also the first step in removing personal sin.
Thus, David prayed: “Search me, God, and know my heart. . . . See if
there is any offensive way in me” (Psalm 139:23–24).

What a wise approach, to go after our sin by asking God to show it to
us. He above all knows everything about us. “You have searched me,
Lord , and you know me,” wrote the psalmist. “You know when I sit and
when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar” (vv. 1–2).

“Such knowledge,” David added, “is too wonderful for me, too lofty for
me to attain” (v. 6). Even before a sin takes root, therefore, God can
alert us to the danger. He knows our “landscape.” So when a sneaky
sinful attitude tries to take root, He’s first to know and point it
out.

“Where can I go from your Spirit,” wrote David. “Where can I flee from
your presence?” (v. 7). May we closely follow our Savior to higher
ground!

Reflect & Pray

When you ask God to search your heart, what personal wrongs do you
discover? How does intentional “weeding” help rid you of a relentless
sin?

Loving God, when You show me my personal sin, point me to Your plan to
pull those weeds.
