The Greatest Mystery

The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all
creation.
Colossians 1:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:15–22

Before I came to faith in Jesus, I’d heard the gospel preached but
wrestled with His identity. How could He offer forgiveness for my sins
when the Bible says only God can forgive sins? I discovered I wasn’t
alone in my struggles after reading J. I. Packer’s Knowing God. Packer
suggests that for many unbelievers the “really staggering Christian
claim is that Jesus of Nazareth was God made man . . . as truly and
fully divine as He was human.” Yet this is the truth that makes
salvation possible.

When the apostle Paul refers to Christ as “the image of the invisible
God,” he’s saying Jesus is completely and perfectly God—Creator and
Sustainer of all things in heaven and earth‒but also fully human
(Colossians 1:15–17). Because of this truth, we can be confident that
through Christ’s death and resurrection, He’s not only carried the
consequences for our sins but has also redeemed human nature, so that
we—and all of creation—can be reconciled to God (vv. 20–22).

In an amazing, initiating act of love, God the Father reveals Himself
in and through Scripture by the power of God the Holy Spirit and
through the life of God the Son. Those who believe in Jesus are saved
because He is Emmanuel—God with us. Hallelujah!

Reflect & Pray

When have you wrestled with your understanding of Jesus? What was the
result?

Loving God, thank You for revealing Yourself and reconciling us
through Jesus.
