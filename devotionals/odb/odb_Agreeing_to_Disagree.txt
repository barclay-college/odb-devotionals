Agreeing to Disagree

Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace.
Romans 14:19

Today's Scripture: Romans 14:1–13

I remember hearing my dad talk about how difficult it was to walk away
from unending arguments over differing interpretations of the Bible.
By contrast he recalled how good it was when both sides agreed to
disagree.

But is it really possible to set aside irreconcilable differences when
so much seems to be at stake? That’s one of the questions the apostle
Paul answers in his New Testament letter to the Romans. Writing to
readers caught in social, political, and religious conflict, he
suggests ways of finding common ground even under the most polarized
conditions (14:5–6).

According to Paul, the way to agree to disagree is to recall that each
of us will answer to the Lord not only for our opinions but also for
how we treat one another in our differences (v. 10).

Conditions of conflict can actually become occasions to remember that
there are some things more important than our own ideas—even more than
our interpretations of the Bible. All of us will answer for whether we
have loved one another, and even our enemies, as Christ loved us.

Now that I think of it, I remember that my dad used to talk about how
good it is not just to agree to disagree but to do so with mutual love
and respect.

Reflect & Pray

Father, please enable us to be patient and kind with those who don’t
agree with us about anything or everything.

We can agree to disagree—in love.
