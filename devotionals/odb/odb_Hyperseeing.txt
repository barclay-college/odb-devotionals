Hyperseeing

When He is revealed, we shall be like Him. —
1 John 3:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:28-30

Sculptors have a term for the artist’s ability to look at a rough
piece of stone and see it in its final, perfected form. It is called
“hyperseeing.”

Gutzon Borglum (1867–1941) is the sculptor who created many well-known
public works of art. Probably the most famous is Mt. Rushmore National
Memorial in South Dakota. Borglum’s housekeeper captured the concept
of hyperseeing when she gazed up at the massive faces of the four US
presidents on Mt. Rushmore for the first time. “Mr. Borglum,” she
gasped, “how did you know Mr. Lincoln was in that rock?”

Hyperseeing is also a good description of our all-seeing God. He sees
all that we are and more. He sees what we shall be when He has
completed His work and we stand before Him, holy and without blemish:
the exact likeness, the very image of Jesus. The God who started this
great work in you will keep at it until He completes it on the very
day Jesus Christ appears (see Phil. 1:6).

God will not be denied! He has such a longing for our perfection that
nothing can or will remain an obstacle until He has finished the work
He began so long ago.

If only . . . if only we will put ourselves in the Master Sculptor’s
hands.

Doubt whispers, “Thou art such a blot; He cannot love poor thee.” If
what I am He lovest not, He loves what I shall be. — MacDonald

God works in us to grow us into what He wants us to be.
