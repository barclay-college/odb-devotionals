Times Of Refreshing

Repent . . . , so that times of refreshing may come from the presence
of the Lord. —
Acts 3:19

Today's Scripture: Acts 3:17-26

What do you find most refreshing? A cold drink on a hot day? An
afternoon nap? Listening to praise and worship music?

The biblical theme of refreshing has a variety of physical and
spiritual meanings. In Scripture we read of refreshment by resting on
the Sabbath (Ex. 23:12), with cool water after physical activity
(Judg. 15:18-19), by soothing music (1 Sam. 16:23), and with
encouraging fellowship (2 Tim. 1:16).

The apostle Peter describes a time of spiritual refreshment that took
place on the Day of Pentecost. He exhorted his listeners to repent and
respond to the gospel “that times of refreshing may come from the
presence of the Lord” (Acts 3:19). The apostle’s statement was
especially meaningful to the Jewish audience with its reference to the
millennium when Messiah would rule. But the good news of spiritual
life would also be extended to the Gentiles (Acts 10).

Even now as believers we can experience a time of refreshing by
quieting our hearts in a devotional time of prayer and Bible reading.
When we spend time alone with the Lord, we can experience His peace
and joy which renew us in spirit. Aren’t you thankful for these daily
times of spiritual refreshment?

Reflect & Pray

A Prayer: Lord, I need my spirit refreshed and renewed today. Speak to
me through Your Word that I might hear Your heart, and help me to
share my heart with You in prayer. Amen.

When we draw near to God, our minds are refreshed and our strength is
renewed.
