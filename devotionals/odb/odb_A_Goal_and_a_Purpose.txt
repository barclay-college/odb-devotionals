A Goal and a Purpose

My only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus
has given me.
Acts 20:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 20:17–24

In 2018, endurance athlete Colin O’Brady took a walk that had never
been taken before. Pulling a supply sled behind him, O’Brady trekked
across Antarctica entirely alone—a total of 932 miles in 54 days. It
was a momentous journey of dedication and courage.

Commenting on his time alone with the ice, the cold, and the daunting
distance, O’Brady said, “I was locked in a deep flow state [fully
immersed in the endeavor] the entire time, equally focused on the end
goal, while allowing my mind to recount the profound lessons of this
journey.”

For those of us who have put our faith in Jesus, that statement might
strike a familiar chord. It sounds a lot like our calling as
believers: focused on the goal of walking through life in a way that
glorifies (honors) God and reveals Him to others. In Acts 20:24, Paul,
no stranger to dangerous journeys, said, “I consider my life worth
nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task
the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of
God’s grace.”

As we walk on in our relationship with Jesus, may we recognize what we
know about the purpose for our journey and press on to the day we’ll
see our Savior face to face.

Dear heavenly Father, as we walk through life, help us to honor You in
all we do. And may we encourage others to journey with You.
