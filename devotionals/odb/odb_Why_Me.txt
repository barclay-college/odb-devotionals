Why Me?

God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still
sinners, Christ died for us. —
Romans 5:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 14:10-21

British pastor Joseph Parker was asked, “Why did Jesus choose Judas to
be one of His disciples?” He thought deeply about the question for a
while but could not come up with an answer. He said that he kept
running into an even more baffling question: “Why did He choose me?”

That’s a question that has been asked throughout the centuries. When
people become painfully aware of their sin and are overcome with
guilt, they cry out to Jesus for mercy. In joyous wonder they
experience the truth that God loves them, that Jesus died for them,
and that they are forgiven of all their sins. It’s incomprehensible!

I too have asked, “Why me?” I know that the dark and sinful deeds of
my life were motivated by a heart even darker, and yet God loved me!
(Rom. 5:8). I was undeserving, wretched, and helpless, yet He opened
His arms and His heart to me. I could almost hear Him whisper, “I love
you even more than you loved your sin.”

It’s true! I cherished my sin. I protected it. I denied its
wrongdoing. Yet God loved me enough to forgive me and set me free.

“Why me?” It’s beyond my understanding. Yet I know He loves me—and He
loves you too!

Reflect & Pray

How wonderful is Your grace, Jesus! It’s greater than all my sin.
You’ve taken away my burdens and set my spirit free. Thank You.

God loves us not because of who we are, but because of who He is.
