Preserved

The Lord himself goes before you.
Deuteronomy 31:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 31:1–8

While I was clearing out the garden in preparation for spring
planting, I pulled up a large clump of winter weeds . . . and leapt
into the air! A venomous copperhead snake lay hidden in the
undergrowth just below my hand—an inch lower and I would have grabbed
it by mistake. I saw its colorful markings as soon as I lifted the
clump; the rest of it was coiled in the weeds between my feet.

When my feet hit the ground a few feet away, I thanked God I hadn’t
been bitten. And I wondered how many other times He had kept me from
dangers I never knew were there.

God watches over His people. Moses told the Israelites as they
prepared to enter the promised land, “The Lord himself goes before you
and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not
be afraid; do not be discouraged” (Deuteronomy 31:8). They couldn’t
see God, but He was with them nonetheless.

Sometimes difficult things happen that we may not understand, but we
can also reflect on the number of times God has preserved us without
our ever being aware!

Scripture reminds us that His perfect, providential care remains over
His people every day. He’s always with us (Matthew 28:20).

Reflect & Pray

How does the biblical truth that God watches over His people comfort
you? Who can you tell about His faithfulness today?

Faithful Father, thank You for watching over me every day. Please give
me grace to walk closely with You in everything I do today.
