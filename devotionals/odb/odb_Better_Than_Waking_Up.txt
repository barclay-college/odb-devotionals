Better Than Waking Up

Today you will be with me in paradise.
Luke 23:43

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 23:33-43

Have you ever felt that your life was ruined as a result of having
done something embarrassing, shameful, or even criminal—only to wake
up and realize it was just a dream? But what if it wasn’t just a
nightmare? What if the situation was all too real—either for yourself
or someone you love?

This is the situation confronted in George MacDonald’s 19th-century
novel The Curate’s Awakening. It’s the story of a parish minister who
discovers that he’s been speaking for a God he’s not even sure he
believes in. Later, he is called to the bedside of a young man who is
losing his mind and dying, haunted by a murder he has committed.

In the heart-rending struggle that follows, the minister discovers
what we all need to see. The relief of waking up from a bad dream is
nothing compared to waking to the reality of God’s forgiveness, which
we once thought was too good to be true.

Where will we find the mercy we need? It is found in Jesus, who, from
His own cross said to a dying criminal who turned to Him for help,
“Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43).

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, please help us to believe that our forgiveness is as
real as the price You paid for our rescue. For further study, read The

We are saved by God’s mercy, not by our merit.
