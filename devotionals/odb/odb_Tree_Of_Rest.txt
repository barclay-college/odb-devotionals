Tree Of Rest

There is a remnant according to the election of grace. —
Romans 11:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ezra 9:5-9

The lone tree in the field across from my office remained a mystery.
Acres of trees had been cut down so the farmer could grow corn. But
one tree remained standing, its branches reaching up and spreading
out. The mystery was solved when I learned the tree was spared for a
purpose. Farmers long ago traditionally left one tree standing so that
they and their animals would have a cool place to rest when the hot
summer sun was beating down.

At times we find that we alone have survived something, and we don’t
know why. Soldiers coming home from combat and patients who’ve
survived a life-threatening illness struggle to know why they survived
when others did not.

The Old Testament speaks of a remnant of Israelites whom God spared
when the nation was sent into exile. The remnant preserved God’s law
and later rebuilt the temple (Ezra 9:9). The apostle Paul referred to
himself as part of the remnant of God (Rom. 11:1,5). He was spared to
become God’s messenger to Gentiles (v.13).

If we stand where others have fallen, it’s to raise our hands to
heaven in praise and to spread our arms as shade for the weary. The
Lord enables us to be a tree of rest for others.

Thank You, Father, that You are my place of rest. And that all You

praise to Yourself through me.

Hope can be ignited by a spark of encouragement.
