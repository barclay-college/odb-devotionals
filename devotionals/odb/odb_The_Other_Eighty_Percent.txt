The Other Eighty Percent

Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in
them. —
Psalm 69:34

Today's Scripture: Psalm 69:29-36

Recently I saw a billboard stating that 80 percent of all life on
Earth is found in the seas. That staggering number is difficult to
process, largely because most of that life is out of sight.

As I considered this, it reminded me of how much greater God’s
creation is than we typically appreciate. While we can easily have our
breath taken away by a majestic mountain range or a panoramic sunset,
we sometimes fail to see His extraordinary work in the details that
require more careful study and examination. Not only is much of God’s
creation hidden by the oceans, but other parts are also too small for
our eyes to observe. From the microscopically small to the unsearched
reaches of the universe, it is all the work of our Creator. In those
magnificent structures—seen and unseen—God’s creative glory is
revealed (Rom. 1:20).

As we grow to understand the wonder of creation, it must always point
us to the Creator Himself—and call us to worship Him. As the psalmist
said, “Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that
moves in them” (Ps. 69:34). If creation itself gives praise to the
Creator, we can and should certainly join the chorus. What a mighty
God we serve!

Reflect & Pray

O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder, Consider all the worlds Thy
hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy
power throughout the universe displayed! —Boberg

The wonder of creation causes us to say, “What a wonderful God!”
