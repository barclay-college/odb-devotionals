The Giver’s Delight

Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the
Messiah, the Lord.
Luke 2:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:4–14

Remember Tickle Me Elmo? Cabbage Patch Kids? The Furby? What do they
have in common? Each rank among the twenty most popular Christmas
gifts of all time. Also included on the list are familiar favorites
such as Monopoly, the Nintendo Game Boy, and Wii.

We all delight in giving gifts at Christmas, but that’s nothing
compared to God’s delight in giving the first Christmas gift. This
gift came in the form of a baby, born in a Bethlehem manger (Luke
2:7).

Despite His humble birth, the Child’s arrival was proclaimed by an
angel who declared, “I bring you good news that will cause great joy
for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born
to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord” (vv. 10–11). Following this
magnificent news, a “heavenly host” appeared, “praising God and
saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to
those on whom his favor rests’” (vv. 13–14).

This Christmas, enjoy giving gifts to your loved ones, but never lose
sight of the reason for the giving—the spectacular favor of God on His
creation crystallized in the gift of His own Son to save us from our
sin. We give because He gave. May we worship Him in gratitude!
