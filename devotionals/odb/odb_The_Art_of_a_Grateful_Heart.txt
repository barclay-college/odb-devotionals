The Art of a Grateful Heart

Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
Psalm 118:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 118:1–14, 26–29

On our wedding day, Martie and I gladly vowed to be faithful “in good
times as well as in bad, in sickness as well as in health, for richer
or for poorer.” In a way it may seem strange to include vows about the
bleak reality of bad times, sickness, and poverty on a cheerful
wedding day. But it underscores the fact that life often has “bad”
times.

So what are we to do when we face life’s inevitable difficulties? Paul
urges us on behalf of Christ to “give thanks in all circumstances” (1
Thessalonians 5:18). As difficult as that may sound, there is good
reason why God encourages us to embrace a spirit of gratitude.
Gratitude is grounded in the truth that our Lord “is good” and “his
love endures forever” (Psalm 118:1). He is present with us and
strengthens us in the midst of trouble (Hebrews 13:5–6), and He
lovingly uses our trials to grow our character into His likeness
(Romans 5:3–4).

When life hits us with hard times, choosing to be grateful focuses our
attention on the goodness of God and gives us the strength to make it
through our struggles. With the psalmist, we can sing, “Give thanks to
the Lord , for he is good; his love endures forever” (Psalm 118:29).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I realize that focusing on my troubles causes me to forget that
even in the midst of trials You are good. Teach me the art of a
grateful heart.

Thanksgiving is a virtue that grows through practice.
