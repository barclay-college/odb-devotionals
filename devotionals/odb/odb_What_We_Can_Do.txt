What We Can Do

In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as
Christ Jesus.
Philippians 2:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:1–11

Even though confined to his bed, 92-year-old Morrie Boogaart knit hats
for the homeless in Michigan. He had reportedly made more than 8,000
hats in fifteen years. Instead of focusing on his health or
limitations, Mr. Boogaart looked beyond himself and did what he
could to place the needs of others above his own. He declared that his
work made him feel good and gave him a purpose. He said, “I’m going to
do this until I go home to the Lord”—which happened in February 2018.
Though most recipients of his hats won’t know his story or how much he
sacrificed to create each cap, Morrie’s simple act of persevering love
is now inspiring people across the world.

We too can look past our struggles, place others before ourselves, and
imitate our loving and compassionate Savior, Jesus Christ (Philippians
2:1–5). God in the flesh—the King of Kings—took on the “very nature of
a servant” in genuine humility (vv. 6–7). Giving His life—the ultimate
sacrifice—He took our place on the cross (v. 8). Jesus gave everything
for us . . . all for the glory of God the Father (vv. 9–11).

As believers in Jesus, it’s our privilege to show love and demonstrate
concern for others through acts of kindness. Even if we don’t think we
have much to offer, we can adopt the attitude of servanthood. We can
actively seek opportunities to make a difference in people’s lives by
simply doing what we can.
