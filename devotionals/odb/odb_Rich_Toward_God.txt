Rich Toward God

Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. —
Luke 12:34

Today's Scripture: Luke 12:13-21

I watch the fluctuations of the stock market and reflect on the
effects of fear and greed. A character in a 1980s movie had this
philosophy: “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is
right! Greed works! . . . Greed [will] save . . . the USA!” What
foolish thinking!

I think of that occasion when a man asked Jesus to serve as an arbiter
and make his brother share their inheritance. Jesus refused the
request but went on to do the man a greater kindness. He pointed out
the motive behind the man’s request and its consequences: “Take heed
and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the
abundance of the things he possesses” (Luke 12:15).

Then Jesus told a parable about a man who harvested a bumper crop and
began to make plans to increase and enjoy his riches. He concluded:
“God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul will be required of you;
then whose will those things be which you have provided?’ So is he who
lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God” (vv.20-21).

The trouble with greed is that ultimately our goods go. But worse—we
go. Better to store up treasure in heaven, invest in spiritual riches,
and become “rich toward God.”

Reflect & Pray

The treasures of earth do not last, But God has prepared us a place
Where someday with Him we will dwell, Enjoying the riches of grace.
—Branon

Our real wealth is what we invest for eternity.
