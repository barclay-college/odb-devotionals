Covering Sinkholes

Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. —
Psalm 32:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 32:1-5

In late May 2010, tropical storm Agatha hit Central America, producing
torrential rains and landslides. Once it finished its course, a
200-foot-deep sinkhole opened in downtown Guatemala City. This
sinkhole caused the ground to collapse suddenly, sucking land,
electrical poles, and a 3-story building into the depths of the earth.

Though sinkholes can be devastating, the most universal and damaging
sinkhole is the one that happens in the human heart. King David was an
example of this.

The surface of David’s life looked stable; however, his interior life
rested on a fragile foundation. After his sins of adultery and murder,
David thought he had successfully hidden his treacherous acts (2 Sam.
11–12). However, God’s intense conviction after Nathan’s confrontation
caused him to realize that denying the presence of sin in his life
weakened the foundation of his spiritual life. To prevent this
spiritual sinkhole from worsening, David acknowledged his sin to God
in repentance (Ps. 32:5). As a result, God covered David’s sin and
gave him the joy of forgiveness.

We too will experience God’s grace when we confess our sins to Him. He
will completely forgive and cover our spiritual sinkholes.
