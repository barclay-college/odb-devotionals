No More Prejudice

My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord
of glory, with partiality. —
James 2:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 2:1-10

A 2010 survey by Newsweek contained some startling statistics: 57
percent of hiring managers believe an unattractive (but qualified) job
candidate would have a harder time getting hired; 84 percent of
managers said their bosses would hesitate before hiring a qualified
older candidate; 64 percent of hiring managers said they believe
companies should be allowed to hire people based on appearance. All
are clear examples of unacceptable prejudice.

Prejudice is not new. It had crept into the early church, and James
confronted it head-on. With prophetic grit and a pastor’s heart, he
wrote: “My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Lord of glory, with partiality” (James 2:1). James gave an example
of this type of prejudice—favoring the rich and ignoring the poor
(vv.2-4). This was inconsistent with holding faith in Jesus without
partiality (v.1), betrayed the grace of God (vv.5-7), violated the law
of love (v.8), and was sinful (v.9). The answer to partiality is
following the example of Jesus: loving your neighbor as yourself.

We fight the sin of prejudice when we let God’s love for us find full
expression in the way we love and treat each other.

Reflect & Pray

Thinking It Over Who helped you determine what is the right way to
treat people? Was it based on external things? What are some ways you
can love people as Jesus did?

Looking up to Jesus prevents us from looking down on others.
