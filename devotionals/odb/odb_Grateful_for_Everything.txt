Grateful for Everything

When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God for
the good land he has given you.
Deuteronomy 8:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 8:6–18

In Australia, it can take hours to drive between towns and fatigue can
lead to accidents. So at busy holiday times rest stops are set up on
major highways with volunteers offering free coffee. My wife, Merryn,
and I grew to enjoy these stops during our long drives there.

On one trip, we pulled in and walked over to order our coffee. An
attendant handed the two cups over, and then asked me for two dollars.
I asked why. She pointed to the small print on the sign. At this stop,
only the driver got free coffee; you had to pay for passengers.
Annoyed, I told her this was false advertising, paid the two dollars,
and walked off. Back at the car, Merryn pointed out my error: I had
turned a gift into an entitlement and become ungrateful for what I
received. She was right.

When the Israelites were about to enter the Promised Land, Moses urged
them to be a grateful people (Deut. 8:10). Thanks to the blessings of
God, the land was abundant, but they could easily treat this
prosperity as something they deserved (vv. 17–18). From this, the Jews
developed a practice of giving thanks for every meal, no matter how
small. For them, it was all a gift.

I went back to the woman and apologized. A free cup of coffee was a
gift I didn’t deserve—and something for which to be thankful.
