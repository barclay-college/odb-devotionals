Prone To Wander

With my whole heart I have sought You; oh, let me not wander from Your
commandments! —
Psalm 119:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:9-16

One of my favorite classic hymns is “Come, Thou Fount of Every
Blessing,” which was written in 1757 by 22-year-old Robert Robinson.
In the hymn’s lyrics is a line that always captures my attention and
forces me to do some self-evaluation. The line says, “Prone to wander,
Lord, I feel it. Prone to leave the God I love.” I feel that way
sometimes. Too often I find myself distracted and drifting, instead of
having my heart and mind focused on the Savior who loves me and gave
Himself for me. Robert Robinson and I are not alone in this.

In those seasons of wandering, our heart of hearts doesn’t want to
drift from God—but, like Paul, we often do what we don’t want to do
(Rom. 7:19), and we desperately need to turn back to the Shepherd of
our heart who can draw us to Himself. David wrote of this struggle in
His great anthem to the Scriptures, Psalm 119, saying, “With my whole
heart I have sought You; oh, let me not wander from Your
commandments!” (v.10).

Sometimes, even when our hearts long to seek God, the distractions of
life can draw us away from Him and His Word. How grateful we can be
for a patient, compassionate heavenly Father whose grace is always
sufficient—even when we are prone to wander!

Reflect & Pray

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.
—Robinson

Our tendency to wander is matched by God’s willingness to pursue.
