Strawberry Mess

Be of the same mind in the Lord. —
Philippians 4:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:1-5

My husband and I had recently moved into our house when a man dropped
off a large box of strawberries on our front sidewalk. He left a note
saying he wanted us to share them with our neighbors. He meant well,
but some children discovered the box before any adults did and had a
strawberry-throwing party at our white house. When we returned home,
we saw children we knew watching us from behind a fence. They had
“returned to the scene of the crime” to see how we would react to the
mess. We could have just cleaned it up ourselves, but to restore our
relationship, we felt it was important to talk with them and require
their help in cleaning our strawberry-stained house.

Life can get messy with relationship struggles. This was the case in
the Philippian church. Two faithful servants, Euodia and Syntyche,
were in sharp disagreement. The apostle Paul wrote to the church to
encourage them to work through their problems (Phil. 4:2). He also
wanted another person to come alongside them with a spirit of
gentleness. He wrote, “I urge you also, true companion, help these
women who labored with me in the gospel” (v.3).

Realizing we’ve all made messes in life, we can trust the Lord to help
us deal gently with others.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, please give me discernment and courage in my relationships.
Help me by Your power to be gentle and show the same love to others
that You have shown to me.

True love both confronts and restores.
