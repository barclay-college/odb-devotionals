The Heavens Declare

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His
handiwork. —
Psalm 19:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 19:1-6

You don’t have to gaze long at the night sky to marvel at the wonder
of God’s awe-inspiring handiwork. The massive stretch of galaxies and
the cloudy mass of our own Milky Way remind us of the spectacular
creation and the sustaining work of Jesus by whom it is all held
together (Col. 1:16-17). It’s as though all of us have front-row seats
in the theater of God’s creative power.

But the nightly show we experience is nothing compared with the glory
that God displayed when He sent His Son to Earth. While shepherds were
watching their flocks, the sky was suddenly ablaze with angelic
messengers praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest!”
(Luke 2:14). Even Magi from a foreign land came and worshiped the King
when God planted the brightest of stars in the east, which led them to
Bethlehem.

While “the heavens declare the glory of God” nightly (Ps. 19:1), never
before or since has the theater of the universe been more alive with
His glory than it was with the announcement that the Creator of this
universe loved us enough to come to our planet to save us from our
sin. Keep that thought in mind the next time you marvel at the stars!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, make us mindful of the glorious day when the heavens resounded
with the announcement of the coming of Your Son. Lead us to glorify
Him in ways that catch the attention of our watching world.

The spectacular glory of God’s love for us was revealed in the coming
of Jesus.
