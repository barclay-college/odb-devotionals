Born To Rescue

For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and
to give His life a ransom for many. —
Mark 10:45

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 10:35-45

After the terrorist attack and the collapse of the Twin Towers in New
York City on September 11, 2001, Cynthia Otto took care of the search-
and-rescue dogs. Years later she established a Working Dog Center
where young pups are put through specialized training to prepare them
to help victims of disaster.

Otto made this comment about these rescue animals: “There are so many
jobs now that dogs are being used for . . . and they can save lives.”
Otto said that these puppies will one day give vital aid to people in
life-threatening circumstances. They are “born” to rescue others.

The Bible tells us of the Messiah who was born to rescue humanity from
the penalty of sin. What He did rises above all earthly comparison.
Two thousand years ago, God Himself became human in order to do for us
what we could not do for ourselves. When Jesus became a man, He
understood and proclaimed that He was born to rescue (John 12:27).
“For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and
to give His life a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45).

Let us praise our wonderful Savior—Jesus Christ—who was born to save
all who will accept His offer of salvation.

Use us, Lord, and make us humble, Rescue us from foolish pride; And
when we begin to stumble, Turn our thoughts to Christ who died. —Sper

Christ came to seek and to save the lost.
