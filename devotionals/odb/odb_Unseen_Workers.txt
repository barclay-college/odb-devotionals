Unseen Workers

We have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the
same function. —
Romans 12:4

Today's Scripture: Romans 12:1-10

As I was giving myself a manicure, I started feeling sorry for my
right hand. It does the most work, but my left hand gets the most
attention. My right hand applies nail polish smoothly to my left-hand
nails, but my left hand, lacking skill and coordination, does not
return the favor. The polish on my right hand is always smeared and
messy. One hand does the better work, but the other hand gets all the
attention and honor.

As I worked on my fingernails, my thoughts turned toward something
much more important—the people in my church, many of whom are highly
skilled at tasks that make others look good. These hardworking folks,
however, seldom get noticed, because their work puts the attention on
someone else. It seems unfair that those who do such good work get
little appreciation.

Truly servant-minded believers, though, don’t see it that way. They
give preference to others (Rom. 12:10) because they know that God sees
what others do not—and that He will reward those whose work is unseen
by others (Matt. 6:4,6,18; 1 Cor. 12:24).

Is someone else reaping the benefit of your hard work? Be encouraged.
God rewards those who work “invisibly” to make Christ visible to the
world.

Reflect & Pray

The service that we do for God May go unpraised by men; But when we
stand before the Lord, He will reward us then. —Sper

No service for Christ goes unnoticed by Him.
