Battling Ego

God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble. —
James 4:6

Today's Scripture: James 4:6-17

When a general returned from a victorious battle, ancient Rome would
stage a parade to welcome the conqueror home. The parade would include
the general’s troops, as well as trophy captives who had been brought
along as evidence of the victory. As the parade made its way through
the city, the crowds would cheer their hero’s success.

To prevent the general’s ego from becoming unduly swollen, a slave
rode along with him in his chariot. Why? So that as the Roman throngs
heaped praise on the general, the slave could continually whisper in
his ear, “You too are mortal.”

When successful, we too may lose sight of our own frailty and allow
our hearts to fill with destructive pride. James pointed us away from
the danger of pride by pointing us to humility and to God. He wrote,
“God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble” (James 4:6).
The key to that statement is grace. Nothing is more wonderful! The
Lord alone deserves thanks and praise—especially for the grace He has
lavished on us.

Our achievements, success, or greatness are not rooted in ourselves.
They are the product of God’s matchless grace, upon which we are
eternally dependent.

Reflect & Pray

New mercies every morning, Grace for every day, New hope for every
trial, And courage all the way. —Mc Veigh

God’s grace is infinite love expressing itself through infinite
goodness.
