Too Much For Me

O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. —
Matthew 26:39

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 26:36-46

“God never gives us more than we can handle,” someone said to a father
whose 5-year-old son had just lost his battle with cancer. These
words, which were intended to encourage him, instead depressed him and
caused him to wonder why he wasn’t “handling” the loss of his boy at
all. The pain was so much to bear that he could hardly even breathe.
He knew his grief was too much for him and that he desperately needed
God to hold him tight.

The verse that some use to support the statement “God never gives us
more than we can handle” is 1 Corinthians 10:13, “When you are
tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it”
(niv). But the context of these words is temptation, not suffering. We
can choose the way out of temptation that God provides, but we can’t
choose a way out of suffering.

Jesus Himself wanted a way out of His upcoming suffering when He
prayed, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. . . . O My
Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me” (Matt.
26:38-39). Yet He willingly went through this for our salvation.

When life seems too much to bear, that’s when we throw ourselves on
God’s mercy, and He holds on to us.

Reflect & Pray

Father, I feel vulnerable and weak. I know You are my refuge and
strength, my help in trouble. I call upon Your name, Lord. Hold on to
me.

With God behind you and His arms beneath you, you can face whatever
lies ahead.
