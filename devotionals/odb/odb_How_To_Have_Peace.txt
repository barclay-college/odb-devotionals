How To Have Peace

We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 5:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:15-23

The Kamppi Chapel of Silence in Helsinki, Finland, stands out in its
urban setting. The curved structure, covered with wood, buffers the
noise from the busy city outside. Designers created the chapel as a
quiet space and a “calm environment for visitors to compose
themselves.” It’s a welcome escape from the hustle and bustle of the
city.

Many people long for peace, and a few minutes of silence may soothe
our minds. But the Bible teaches that real peace—peace with God—comes
from His Son. The apostle Paul said, “Therefore, having been justified
by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom.
5:1). Without Christ, we are enemies of God because of our sin.
Thankfully, accepting Jesus’ sacrifice reconciles us to God and ends
the hostility that existed between us (Col. 1:19-21). He now sees us
as Christ presents us—“holy, and blameless, and above reproach” (v.
22).

Having peace with God does not ensure problem-free living. However, it
does steady us during difficult times. Jesus told His followers, “In
the world you will have tribulation,” but He also said, “In Me you may
have peace” (John 16:33). Because of Christ, the true peace of God can
fill our hearts (Col. 3:15).
