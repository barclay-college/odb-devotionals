A War Of Words

A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. —
Proverbs 15:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 15:1-23

On July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in response
to the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife,
Sophie. Within 90 days, other European countries had taken sides to
honor their military alliances and pursue their own ambitions. A
single event escalated into World War I, one of the most destructive
military conflicts of modern time.

The tragedy of war is staggering, yet our relationships and families
can begin to fracture with only a few hateful words. James wrote, “See
how great a forest a little fire kindles!” (James 3:5). A key to
avoiding verbal conflict is found in Proverbs: “A soft answer turns
away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger” (15:1).

A small comment can start a large fight. When we, by God’s grace,
choose not to retaliate with our words, we honor Jesus our Savior.
When He was abused and insulted, He fulfilled the prophetic words of
Isaiah, “He was oppressed and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His
mouth” (Isa. 53:7).

Proverbs urges us to speak the truth and seek peace through our words.
“A wholesome tongue is a tree of life, . . . and a word spoken in due
season, how good it is!” (15:4,23).

Reflect & Pray

A careless word may kindle strife, A cruel word may wreck a life; A
timely word may lessen stress, A loving word may heal and bless.
—Anon.

Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let
me sow love.
