How To Get A New Heart

I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you. —
Ezekiel 36:26

Today's Scripture: Ezekiel 36:26-31

A friend who is a heart transplant cardiologist has an appreciation of
Ezekiel 36:26 that not many of us can understand. Mike manages the
pre-operation and post-operation care for heart-transplant patients.
He’s often in the operating room as surgeons remove diseased,
discolored hearts and replace them with vibrant, pink “new” donor
hearts.

Mike explains that the process for selecting who gets a “new” physical
heart is similar to who can get a “new heart” from God (Ezek. 36:26).
In both cases, need alone is the criterion.

Ezekiel’s mention of the people of Israel someday getting a “new
heart” is a foreshadowing of the change that takes place at salvation.
Ephesians 4:24 and 2 Corinthians 5:17 refer to it as “new man” and
“new creation.” For the Israelites of Ezekiel’s day and for those of
us living today, only one criterion must be met for us to acquire a
“transplant.” We must need it. It matters not whether we’re rich or
poor, respected or scorned. Citizenship, social status, and ethnicity
are inconsequential. If we need a new heart from God, we can have one
through faith in Jesus Christ’s death and resurrection.

What indicates that need? As sinners, all of us need a new heart. Have
you had a spiritual heart transplant?

Reflect & Pray

Christ asks you for nothing— Come just as you are; Come sinful, come
guilty, Come give Him your heart. —Anon.

We need more than a new start— we need a new heart!
