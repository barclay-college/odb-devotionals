Heaven Rejoices!

There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who
repents. —
Luke 15:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 15:1-10

Joann had been raised in a Christian home. But when she went to
college, she began to question her beliefs and walked away from God.
After graduation, she traveled to a number of countries, always
looking for happiness but never feeling satisfied. While experiencing
some difficulties, she recognized that God was pursuing her and that
she needed Him.

From Germany, Joann called her parents in the US and said, “I have
given my life to Christ, and He’s changing me! I’m sorry for the worry
I have caused you.” Her parents were so excited that they called her
brothers and sisters-in-law to come over immediately. They wanted to
tell them the exciting news in person. “Your sister has received
Christ!” they said, rejoicing through tears.

The woman in Luke 15 who found her lost coin called her friends and
neighbors together to rejoice with her (v.9). Jesus told this story,
and others about a lost sheep and a lost son, to the religious people
of His day to show how He came to earth to pursue lost sinners. When
we accept God’s gift of salvation, there is rejoicing both on earth
and in heaven. Jesus said, “There is joy in the presence of the angels
of God over one sinner who repents” (v.10). How wonderful that Jesus
has reached down to us and heaven rejoices when we respond!

I was lost but Jesus found me— Found the sheep that went astray, Threw
His loving arms around me, Drew me back into His way. —Rowley

Angels rejoice when we repent.
