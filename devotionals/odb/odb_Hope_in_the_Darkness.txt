Hope in the Darkness

I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.
Jeremiah 31:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 31:16–26

According to legend, Qu Yuan was a wise and patriotic Chinese
government official who lived during the time known as the Warring
States period (475–246 bc ). It has been said that he tried repeatedly
to warn his king about an impending threat that would destroy the
country, but the king rejected his advice. Eventually, Qu Yuan was
exiled. When he learned about the fall of his beloved country to the
foe he had warned about, he ended his life.

Qu Yuan’s life resembles some aspects of the life of the prophet
Jeremiah. He too served kings who scorned his warnings, and his
country was ravaged. However, while Qu Yuan gave in to his despair,
Jeremiah found genuine hope. Why the difference?

Jeremiah knew the Lord who offers the only true hope. “There is hope
for your descendants,” God had assured His prophet. “Your children
will return to their own land” (Jeremiah 31:17). Although Jerusalem
was destroyed in 586 bc , it was later rebuilt (see Nehemiah 6:15).

At some point, we all find ourselves in situations that can cause us
to despair. It could be a bad medical report, a sudden job loss, a
shattered family. But when life knocks us down, we can still look
up—for God is on the throne! He holds our days in His hands, and He
holds us close to His heart.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, fill me up with hope and give me a tangible reminder today that
things will turn out right in Your way, in Your time.

The world hopes for the best, but the Lord offers the best hope. John
