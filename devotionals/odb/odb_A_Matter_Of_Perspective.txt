A Matter Of Perspective

[You] do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and
naked. —
Revelation 3:17

Today's Scripture: Revelation 3:14-22

One of my favorite stories is about the Texas rancher who was doing
agricultural consulting for a farmer in Germany. He asked the German
farmer about the size of his property, to which he replied, “About a
mile square.” When the German asked the Texan about the size of his
ranch, the rancher explained that if he got in his pick-up truck at
dawn and drove until sunset he would still be on his ranch. Not to be
outdone, the farmer replied, “I used to have an old truck like that!”

All joking aside, it’s important to have the right perspective.
Unfortunately, the Christians in Laodicea had the wrong perspective
about wealth (Rev. 3:14-22). By all appearances, they were rich. They
had plenty of earthly goods and thought they needed nothing—not even
Jesus. But Jesus had a different perspective. In spite of their
material prosperity, He saw that they were “wretched, miserable, poor,
blind, and naked” (v.17). So He invited them to become truly rich by
seeking what only He could provide: purity, character, righteousness,
and wisdom.

Let’s not make the Laodicean mistake. Instead, let’s keep our
perspective right about what it means to be rich. True wealth is not
measured by what you have but by who you are in Christ.

Reflect & Pray

In Christ we’re rich beyond belief With wealth the world cannot see;
We have new strength and character, New righteousness and purity.

The poorest person is he whose only wealth is money.
