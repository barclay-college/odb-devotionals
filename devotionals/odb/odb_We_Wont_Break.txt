We Won’t Break

Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?
Matthew 6:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:25–34

As a native Californian and lover of all things sunny, I shy away from
all things cold. I do, however, enjoy beautiful photos of snow. So I
couldn’t help but smile when my friend from Illinois shared a winter
picture of a sapling outside her window. Admiration turned to sadness
when I noticed its bare, knotted branches bowing under the heavy
fringe of sparkling icicles.

How long could those bending boughs endure before breaking under their
icy burdens? The heaviness threatening to crack the tree’s limbs
reminded me of my shoulders, hunched beneath the weight of worries.

After Jesus affirms that the greatest treasures are not earthly or
temporary, He encourages us to release our anxious thoughts. The
Creator and Sustainer of the universe loves and provides for His
children, so we don’t have to waste our precious time worrying. God
knows our needs and will care for us (Matthew 6:19–32).

He also knows we’ll be tempted to succumb to worry. He tells us to
come to Him first, trust His presence and provision in the present,
and live by faith one day at a time (vv. 33–34).

In this life, we’ll face overwhelming troubles and uncertainties that
can make our shoulders droop. We may temporarily bend under the weight
of worrying. But when we trust God, we won’t break.

Reflect & Pray

Thanks for assuring us that we never have to worry, Lord, because You
never fail to meet our deepest needs.

Worry won’t break us when we trust the Giver of all good things.
