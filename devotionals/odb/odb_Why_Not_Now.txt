Why Not Now?

David, after he had served his own generation . . . fell asleep. —
Acts 13:36

Today's Scripture: John 13:33-38

I have a dear friend who served as a missionary in Suriname for many
years, but in his final years he was stricken with an illness that
paralyzed him. At times he wondered why God allowed him to linger. He
longed to depart and to be with his Lord.

Perhaps life is very hard for you or a loved one, and you are
wondering why God has allowed you or your loved one to linger. When
Jesus said He was going to heaven, Peter asked, “Lord, why can I not
follow You now?” (John 13:37). You, like Peter, may wonder why entry
into heaven has been postponed: “Why not now?”

God has a wise and loving purpose in leaving us behind. There is work
to be done in us that can only be accomplished here on earth. Our
afflictions, which are for the moment, are working for us “a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of glory” (2 Cor. 4:17). And there is
work to be done for others—if only to love and to pray. Our presence
may also be for the purpose of giving others an opportunity to learn
love and compassion.

So, though you may desire release for yourself or a loved one, to live
on in the flesh can mean fruitfulness (Phil. 1:21). And there is
comfort in waiting: Though heaven may be delayed, God has His reasons.
No doubt about it!

Reflect & Pray

Not so in haste, my heart! Have faith in God, and wait; Although He
seems to linger long He never comes too late. —Torrey

Our greatest comfort is to know that God is in control.
