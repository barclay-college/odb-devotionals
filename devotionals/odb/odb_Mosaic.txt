Mosaic

We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works. —
Ephesians 2:10

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 2:10-22

For 3 weeks every fall season, our city becomes an art gallery. Nearly
2,000 artists from around the world display their creations in
galleries, museums, hotels, parks, city streets, parking lots,
restaurants, churches, and even in the river.

Among my favorite entries are mosaics made from small pieces of
colored glass. The winning entry in 2011 was a 9 x 13-foot stained-
glass mosaic of the crucifixion by artist Mia Tavonatti. While viewing
the artwork, I heard the artist discuss how many times she had cut
herself while shaping the pieces of glass for her mosaic.

As I gazed at the beautiful rendition of what was a horrific event, I
saw more than a representation of the crucifixion—I saw a picture of
the church, the body of Christ. In each piece of glass I saw an
individual believer, beautifully shaped by Christ to fit together into
the whole (Eph. 2:16,21). In the artist’s story, I recognized the
shedding of Jesus’ blood so that this unity could take place. And in
the finished artwork, I saw the act of love required to complete the
project despite pain and sacrifice.

We who believe in Christ are a work of art created by God to show the
greatness of a Savior who makes something beautiful out of the broken
pieces of our lives.
