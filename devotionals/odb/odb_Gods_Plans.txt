God’s Plans

What do you want your servant to do? (nlt)
Joshua 5:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Joshua 5:13–6:2

An army officer may have an overall plan, but before each battle he
has to receive and give out new instructions. Joshua, a leader of the
Israelites, had to learn this lesson. After God’s people spent 40
years in the wilderness, God chose Joshua to lead them into the land
He had promised to them.

The first stronghold they faced was the city of Jericho. Before the
battle, Joshua saw the “commander of the Lord’s army” (probably the
Lord Himself) standing opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand.
Joshua fell on his face and worshiped. In other words, he recognized
God’s greatness and his own smallness. Then he asked, “What message
does my Lord have for his servant?” (Josh. 5:14). Joshua experienced
victory at Jericho because he followed the Lord’s instructions.

On another occasion, however, Joshua and his people “did not inquire
of the Lord ” (9:14). As a result, they were deceived into making a
peace treaty with the people of Gibeon, enemies in the land of Canaan.
This displeased the Lord (vv. 3-26).

We too are dependent on the Lord as we face life’s struggles. He longs
for us to come near to Him today in humility. And He’ll be there again
for us tomorrow.
