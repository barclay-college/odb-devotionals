A Perfect Father

The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after
them.
Proverbs 20:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 20:3–7

My father once admitted to me, “When you were growing up, I was gone a
lot.”

I don’t remember that. Besides working his full-time job, he was gone
some evenings to direct choir practice at church, and he occasionally
traveled for a week or two with a men’s quartet. But for all the
significant (and many small) moments of my life—he was there.

For instance, when I was eight, I had a tiny part in an afternoon play
at school. All the mothers came, but only one dad—mine. In many little
ways, he has always let my sisters and me know that we are important
to him and that he loves us. And seeing him tenderly caring for my mom
in the last few years of her life taught me exactly what unselfish
love looks like. Dad isn’t perfect, but he’s always been a dad who
gives me a good glimpse of my heavenly Father. And ideally, that’s
what a Christian dad should do.

At times earthly fathers disappoint or hurt their children. But our
Father in heaven is “compassionate and gracious, slow to anger,
abounding in love” (Ps. 103:8). When a dad who loves the Lord
corrects, comforts, instructs, and provides for the needs of his
children, he models for them our perfect Father in heaven.
