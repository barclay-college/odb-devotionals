Until You Are Full

I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he
who believes in Me shall never thirst. —
John 6:35

Today's Scripture: John 6:25-29

A friend who lives in Singapore told me about an old Chinese greeting.
Instead of “How are you?” people would ask “Have you eaten until you
are full?” The greeting likely originated during a time when food was
scarce and many people did not know when they would have their next
meal. When food was available, it was advisable to eat until they were
full.

After Jesus miraculously fed 5,000 people with five loaves and two
small fish (John 6:1-13), the crowd followed Him wanting more
(vv.24-26). The Lord told them not to work for physical food that
spoils, but “for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the
Son of Man will give you . . . . I am the bread of life. He who comes
to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never
thirst” (vv.27,35).

As followers of Jesus, we should help those who lack adequate physical
nutrition. And with all, we can share the good news that our hunger
for inner peace, forgiveness, and hope can be satisfied by knowing
Christ the Lord.

Jesus Christ, the bread of life, invites us to come to Him for His
feast for the soul, urging us to eat until we are full.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Jesus, that You call out to those who are weary and thirsty
and say, “Come to Me and be filled.” We are hungry and are thankful
that You satisfy us. Amen.

There is a longing in every heart that only Jesus can satisfy.
