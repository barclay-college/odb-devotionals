Medieval Meal

How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
—
Psalm 119:103

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 19:7-14

A while ago I attended a conference on the Middle Ages. In one seminar
we actually prepared several foods that would have been common in
medieval times. We used pestle and mortar to grind cinnamon and fruit
to make jam. We cut orange rinds and broiled them with honey and
ginger to produce a sweet snack. We crushed almonds with water and
other ingredients to create almond milk. And, finally, we prepared a
whole chicken to serve as a main dish with rice. As we sampled these
dishes, we enjoyed a tasty culinary experience.

When it comes to spiritual food for our souls, God has given us a
varied menu that we can chew on and savor. In doing so, we can be
filled and satisfied. The historic books, poetry, wisdom literature,
prophecy, and other parts of the Bible strengthen us when we are weak,
give us wisdom and encouragement, and nourish us for the day’s journey
(Ps. 19:7-14; 119:97-104; Heb. 5:12). As the psalmist tells us: “How
sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!”
(Ps. 119:103).

So what are we waiting for? God has set before us a banquet of
delectable spiritual food and calls us to come and dine. We are all
invited!

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, that You call me to Your table to feast on Your Word.
I know that I need it for my spiritual nourishment and to grow close
to You. I open my heart to You now.

The Bible is the bread of life, and it never gets stale.
