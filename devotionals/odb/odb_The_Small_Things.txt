The Small Things

Every good and perfect gift is from above.
James 1:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 116:1–9

My friend Gloria called with excitement in her voice. She had not been
able to leave her home except for doctors’ appointments. So I
understood why she was so happy to tell me, “My son just attached new
speakers to my computer, so now I can go to my church!” Now she could
hear the live broadcast of her church’s worship service. She raved
about God’s goodness and the “best gift my son could have given me!”

Gloria teaches me about having a thankful heart. Despite her many
limitations, she’s thankful for the smallest of things—sunsets,
helpful family and neighbors, quiet moments with God, the ability to
remain in her own apartment. She’s had a lifetime of seeing God
provide for her, and she talks about Him to anyone who visits or
calls.

We don’t know what difficulties the author of Psalm 116 was
encountering. Some Bible commentaries say it was probably sickness
because he said, “the cords of death entangled me” (v. 3). But he gave
thanks to the Lord for being gracious and full of compassion when he
was “brought low” (vv. 5–6).

When we’re low, it can be hard to look up. Yet if we do, we see that
God is the giver of all good gifts in our life—great and small—and we
learn to give Him thanks.

Reflect & Pray

What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me? . . . I
will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving (Ps. 116:12, 17 esv ).

Praise to God comes naturally when you count your blessings.
