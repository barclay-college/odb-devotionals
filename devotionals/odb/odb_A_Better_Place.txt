A Better Place

God Himself will be with them and be their God. —
Revelation 21:3

Today's Scripture: Revelation 21:4-11

When my friend Marci’s father-in-law passed away, she stopped making
his favorite dessert: pineapple salad. One day, her little boy asked
why she no longer served it. She replied, “It reminds me of Papa, and
it makes me sad; Papa really liked that dessert.” Her son replied in a
chipper tone, “Not better than heaven!”

That little boy had the right idea. Heaven is a much better place.
Remembering this can help ease our sadness when things on earth
trigger memories of believing loved ones who have passed away. Our
friends and family who have heavenly addresses are much happier there
because:

• Heaven is God’s home. God’s followers will enjoy His presence for
all eternity (Rev. 21:3-4).

• Heaven is comfortable in every way. Heaven’s residents will never be
sick or upset (21:4), hungry or thirsty (7:16).

• Heaven is a beautiful place. A “clear as crystal” river will flow
from God’s throne (22:1), and God Himself will give heaven its light
(22:5).

Do things in this world sometimes remind you of believers who have
moved on to the next world? If so, it’s comforting to think that they
are now enjoying heaven—a better place by far.

Reflect & Pray

If God has made this world so fair, Where sin and death abound, How
beautiful beyond compare Will paradise be found! —Montgomery

The pleasures of earth cannot be compared to the joys of heaven.
