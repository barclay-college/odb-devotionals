A Season For Everything

To everything there is a season. —
Ecclesiastes 3:1

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

In the 1960s, the folk-rock band The Byrds popularized the song “Turn!
Turn! Turn!” It climbed to the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart
and gained worldwide popularity. People seemed captivated by the
lyrics. Interestingly, though, except for the last line, those lyrics
are from the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes.

“To everything there is a season,” proclaims the writer of
Ecclesiastes, “a time for every purpose under heaven” (3:1). He then
lists some of the seasons in human experience: birth and death, gain
and loss, tears and laughter, mourning and dancing. Just as the
seasons in nature change, so do the seasons in our lives. Our
circumstances never stay the same for long.

Sometimes we welcome change in our lives. But often it is difficult,
especially when it involves sorrow and loss. Yet even then we can be
thankful that God does not change. “I am the Lord,” He said through
the prophet Malachi, “I do not change” (Mal. 3:6).

Because God remains the same, we can rely on Him through the shifting
seasons of life. His presence is always with us (Ps. 46:1), His peace
has the power to guard our hearts (Phil. 4:7), and His love provides
security for our souls (Rom. 8:39).

Reflect & Pray

A mighty fortress is our God, A bulwark never failing; Our helper He
amid the flood Of mortal ills prevailing. — Luther

God’s unchanging nature is our security during seasons of change.
