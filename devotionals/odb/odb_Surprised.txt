Surprised!

Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him.
Luke 24:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 24:13-35

Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571–1610), an Italian artist, was
known for his fiery temperament and unconventional technique. He used
ordinary working people as models for his saints and was able to make
viewers of his paintings feel they were a part of the scene. The
Supper at Emmaus shows an innkeeper standing while Jesus and two of
His followers are seated at a table when they recognize Him as the
risen Lord (Luke 24:31). One disciple is pushing himself to a standing
position while the other’s arms are outstretched and his hands open in
astonishment.

Luke, who records these events in his gospel, tells us that the two
men immediately returned to Jerusalem where they found the eleven
disciples and others assembled together and saying, “ ‘It is true! The
Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.’ Then the two told what had
happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he
broke the bread” (vv. 33-35).

Oswald Chambers said, “Jesus rarely comes where we expect Him; He
appears where we least expect Him, and always in the most illogical
connections. The only way a worker can keep true to God is by being
ready for the Lord’s surprise visits.”

Whatever road we are on today, may we be ready for Jesus to make
Himself known to us in new and surprising ways.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, open our eyes to see You, the risen Christ, alongside us
and at work in the circumstances of our lives today.

To find the Lord Jesus Christ we must be willing to seek Him.
