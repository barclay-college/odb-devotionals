The Riches Of Obedience

I have rejoiced in your laws as much as in riches. —
Psalm 119:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:14,33-40

Publicly operated lotteries exist in more than 100 countries. In a
recent year, lottery ticket sales totaled more than $85 billion in
just the US and Canada, only part of the total sales worldwide. The
lure of huge jackpots has created a mindset among many that all of
life’s problems would be solved “if I won the lottery.”

There’s nothing wrong with wealth itself, but it has the power to
deceive us into thinking that money is the answer to all our needs.
The psalmist, expressing a different point of view, wrote: “I have
rejoiced in your laws as much as in riches. . . . I will delight in
your decrees and not forget your word” (Ps. 119:14,16 nlt). This
concept of spiritual treasure is focused on obedience to God and
walking “in the path of [His] commandments” (v.35).

What if we were more excited about following the Lord’s Word than
about winning a jackpot worth millions? With the psalmist we might
pray, “Incline my heart to Your testimonies, and not to covetousness.
Turn away my eyes from looking at worthless things, and revive me in
Your way” (vv.36-37).

The riches of obedience—true riches—belong to all who walk with the
Lord.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, may I commit each day to standing on the unchanging truth
of Your Word and to growing in my relationship with You, the only
measure of success in this life and in eternity.

Success is knowing and loving God.
