Quest For Stolen Treasure

[Jesus] said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
—
Matthew 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 4:18-22

In J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, the dwarfs gathered to go up against
Smaug, the fierce dragon, to retrieve their stolen treasure. In spite
of the dangerously frightening quest, Balin, the dwarfs’ second-in-
command, expressed confidence in Thorin: “There is one I could follow.
There is one I could call King.” His commitment to the mission, as
dangerous as it was, was empowered by his confidence in his leader.

At the beginning of Jesus’ earthly ministry, He gathered a group
around Him that would join Him in the kingdom task of rescuing the
treasure of lost souls from our enemy, Satan. When He called them, He
said, “Follow Me” (Matt. 4:19). For them, following Jesus would mean a
radical transition from catching fish to the enterprise of being
fishers of men and women who were lost in the grip of sin. But the
task would not always be easy; Jesus referred to the quest as taking
up our cross to follow Him (see Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23).

How do we stay engaged in the battle to reclaim Christ’s lost
treasures when it seems intimidating or awkward? By keeping our eye on
our Leader. He indeed is worthy—One we can follow, the One we call
King!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, in the face of intimidation and fear when seeking to engage
others with the gospel, remind me that they are Your lost treasures. I
count it a privilege to follow You into others’ lives.

Follow your Leader into the lives of those around you.
