Wisdom’s Call

Wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can
compare with her.
Proverbs 8:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 8:10–21

Malcolm Muggeridge, the noted British journalist and social critic,
came to faith in Christ at the age of sixty. On his seventy-
fifth birthday he offered twenty-five insightful observations about
life. One said, “I never met a rich man who was happy, but I have only
very occasionally met a poor man who did not want to become a rich
man.”

Most of us would agree that money can’t make us happy, but we might
like to have more so we can be sure.

King Solomon’s net worth has been estimated at more than two trillion
US dollars. Although he was very wealthy, he knew that money had great
limitations. Proverbs 8 is based on his experience and offers
“Wisdom’s Call” to all people. “I raise my voice to all mankind. . . .
My mouth speaks what is true” (vv. 4–7). “Choose my instruction
instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold, for wisdom is
more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with
her” (vv. 10–11).

Wisdom says, “My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield
surpasses choice silver. I walk in the way of righteousness, along the
paths of justice, bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me
and making their treasuries full” (vv. 19–21).

These are true riches indeed!
