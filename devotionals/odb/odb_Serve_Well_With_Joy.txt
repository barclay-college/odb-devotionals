Serve Well With Joy

Serve the Lord with gladness. —
Psalm 100:2

Today's Scripture: Psalm 100

Nine years ago today a good friend went out for a lunchtime jog and
never came back. Kurt De Haan, who was the managing editor of Our
Daily Bread, died of a heart attack on that sunny Thursday. Some of us
who worked with Kurt still keep mementos of him in our offices.

For instance, on one wall of my cubicle, I display the last memo I
received from Kurt. It reminds me of his thoroughness as an
editor—striving to represent God’s Word accurately and well. Another
co-worker displays the last paper wad Kurt threw in her direction,
reminding her of his eagerness to enjoy life.

Each time we talk about Kurt and how much we miss him, we discuss his
combination of a quest for excellence mixed with an enjoyable
personality. He worked hard and loved life. He strove to teach God’s
Word with integrity while living his life with joy.

Remembering Kurt and his example is refreshing and challenging. It
reminds us that others are watching us and can tell if we’re serving
“the Lord with gladness” (Ps. 100:2), and if our love for Jesus is
coming through in our good works (Eph. 2:10). Serve well. Serve with
joy. Does that describe our work for the Savior?

Reflect & Pray

Help me, dear Jesus, to live out the joy and peace You’ve given to me.
May those who work with and know me see that joy. And may I always
stand for truth and righteousness.

For joy that will last, always put Christ first.
