Powerful Baby

How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? . . . But I trust in your
unfailing love.
Psalm 13:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 13

The first time I saw him, I cried. He looked like a perfect newborn
asleep in his crib. But we knew he would never wake up. Not until he
was in the arms of Jesus.

He clung to life for several months. Then his mother told us of his
death in a heart-wrenching email. She wrote of “that deep, deep pain
that groans inside you.” Then she said, “How deeply God carved His
work of love into our hearts through that little life! What a powerful
life it was!”

Powerful? How could she say that?

This family’s precious little boy showed them—and us—that we must
depend on God for everything. Especially when things go horribly
wrong! The hard yet comforting truth is that God meets us in our pain.
He knows the grief of losing a Son.

In our deepest pain, we turn to the songs of David because he writes
out of his own grief. “How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and
day after day have sorrow in my heart?” he asked (Ps. 13:2). “Give
light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death” (v. 3). Yet David could
give his biggest questions to God. “But I trust in your unfailing
love; my heart rejoices in your salvation” (v. 5).

Only God can bring ultimate significance to our most tragic events.

Reflect & Pray

Where do I turn when a crisis hits me? Do I ever get angry with God
when facing grief and loss? Am I afraid to share my true emotions with
Him? Have I ever asked God for His peace?

God can do the most with what we think is least.
