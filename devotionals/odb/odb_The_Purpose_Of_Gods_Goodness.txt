The Purpose Of God’s Goodness

God be merciful to us and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon
us. —
Psalm 67:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 67

When I was growing up, we often sang a song in Sunday school that went
like this: “God is good to me! God is good to me! He holds my hand and
helps me stand! God is good to me!”

I need to say right away that I believe God is good and He takes
delight in doing good things for people. He does indeed hold our hand
in times of trouble and helps us stand against the onslaught of life’s
difficulties. But I wonder if you’ve ever asked yourself, Why is He
good? It certainly is not because we deserve it or because He feels
the need to buy our love and allegiance with His benefits.

The psalmist prays for God to bless him so that “[the Lord’s] way may
be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations” (Ps. 67:2). God’s
daily blessings are proof positive that He is indeed a good God who
cares for His own. But how will our world know this about God if we
never praise Him for His goodness to us? (v.3).

So, the next time God blesses you, be sure to look for ways to
appropriately give Him the credit. Consuming His blessings without
communicating His goodness shortchanges the very purpose of His gifts
of grace in our lives.

God is good—make sure the people in your world know what He has done
in your life.
