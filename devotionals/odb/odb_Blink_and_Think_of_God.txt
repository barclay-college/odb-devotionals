Blink and Think of God

He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his
eye.
Deuteronomy 32:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 32:1–12

“God is like an eyelid,” my friend Ryley said, and I blinked in
surprise. What could she mean by that?

“Tell me more,” I replied. Together, we had been studying surprising
pictures of God in the Bible, things like God as a laboring mother
(Isa. 42:14) or as a beekeeper (7:18), but this one was new to me.
Ryley pointed me to Deuteronomy 32, where Moses praises the way God
takes care of His people. Verse 10 says that God shields and protects
His people, guarding them “as the apple of his eye.”

But the word we translate apple, Ryley told me, literally means pupil.
And what encircles and guards the pupil? The eyelid, of course! God is
like the eyelid, which instinctively protects the tender eye. The
eyelid guards the eye from danger, and by blinking helps remove dirt
or dust. It keeps sweat out of the eye. It lubricates the eyeball,
keeping it healthy. It closes, allowing rest.

As I considered the picture of God as an eyelid, I couldn’t help but
thank God for the many metaphors He’s given us to help us understand
His love for us. When we close our eyes at night and open them in the
morning, we can think of God, and praise Him for His tender protection
and care for us.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, God, for using surprising metaphors to help us understand
You better. Thanks for guarding us just as the eyelid guards the eye.

When you blink, remember to thank God for His protection.
