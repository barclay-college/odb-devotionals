Doing What He Says

Walk in obedience to all that the Lord your God has commanded you.
Deuteronomy 5:33

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 5:28–33

I needed an underground water tank and knew precisely how I wanted it
constructed, so I gave clear instructions to the builder. The next day
when I inspected the project, I was annoyed when I realized that he
had failed to carry out my instructions. He had changed the plan and
therefore the effect. The excuse he gave was as irritating as his
failure to follow my directives.

As I watched him redo the concrete work, and as my frustration
diminished, a guilty conviction swept over me: How many times have I
needed to redo things in my life in obedience to the Lord?

Like the ancient Israelites who frequently failed to do what God asked
them to do, we too often go our own way. Yet obedience is a desired
result of our deepening relationship with God. Moses told the people,
“Be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you . . . .
Walk in obedience to all that [he] has commanded you” (Deut. 5:32–33).
Long after Moses, Jesus urged His disciples to trust Him and to love
one another.

This is still the kind of surrender of our hearts that leads to our
well-being. As the Spirit helps us to obey, it is good to remember
that He “works in [us] to will and to act in order to fulfill his good
purpose” (Phil. 2:13).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for second and third chances. Please help us to want
to follow Your ways and to follow through in obedience.

The closer we walk with God, the clearer we see His guidance.
