The Apple of His Eye

Whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye.
Zechariah 2:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Zechariah 2

A friend’s baby was suffering seizures, so they sped to the hospital
in an ambulance, her heart racing as she prayed for her daughter. Her
fierce love for this child hit her afresh as she held her tiny
fingers, recalling too how much more the Lord loves us and how we are
“the apple of His eye.”

The prophet Zechariah employs this phrase in his word to God’s people
who had returned to Jerusalem after their captivity in Babylon. He
calls them to repent, to rebuild the temple, and to renew their hearts
of love for the true God. For the Lord loves His people greatly; they
are the apple of His eye.

Hebrew scholars suggest this phrase from Zechariah 2 denotes one’s
reflection in the pupil of another’s eye, with the word “apple”
emerging because it’s a common spherical object. So with eyes being
precious and fragile, they need protecting, and that’s how the Lord
wants to love and protect His people—by holding them close to His
heart.

The Lord who dwells in our midst pours out His love on us—even,
amazingly, far more than a loving mother who does all she can for her
ailing child. We are the apple of His eye, His beloved.

Reflect & Pray

Father God, You love us so much that You gave us Your only Son to die
that we might live. May we receive Your love this day and live in it.

A parent’s love for a child reflects our Father’s love for us.
