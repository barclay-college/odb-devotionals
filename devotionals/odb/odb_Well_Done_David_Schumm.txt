Well Done, David Schumm

Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come. —
Isaiah 35:4

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 35:3-10

At David Schumm’s memorial service, we celebrated the optimism,
perseverance, and faith of a man with severe cerebral palsy. For all
of David’s 74 years, the simple tasks of daily life required great
effort. Through it all, he kept smiling and helping others by giving
more than 23,000 hours as a hospital volunteer, along with encouraging
at-risk teens.

David selected Isaiah 35:3-10 to be read at his service: “Strengthen
the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees. Say to those who are
fearful-hearted, ‘Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come
with vengeance, with the recompense of God; He will come and save
you. . . . Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the
dumb sing. For waters shall burst forth in the wilderness, and streams
in the desert” (vv.3-4,6). This promise, given to the people of Israel
while in captivity, reminds us of our hope for the time when Christ
will return for those who trust and follow Him.

During David’s last weeks, he often pointed visitors to a large
picture of Jesus near his bed, saying, “He’s coming to get me soon.”
This is the hope Jesus Christ gives to all His children, which calls
forth our thanks and praise to Him!
