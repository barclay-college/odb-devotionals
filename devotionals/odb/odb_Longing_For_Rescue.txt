Longing For Rescue

She will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He
will save His people from their sins. —
Matthew 1:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 1:18-25

The movie Man of Steel, released in 2013, is a fresh imagining of the
Superman story. Filled with breathtaking special effects and nonstop
action, it drew crowds to movie theaters around the world. Some said
that the film’s appeal was rooted in its amazing technology. Others
pointed to the enduring appeal of the “Superman mythology.”

Amy Adams, the actress who plays Lois Lane in the movie, has a
different view of Superman’s appeal. She says it is about a basic
human longing: “Who doesn’t want to believe that there’s one person
who could come and save us from ourselves?”

That’s a great question. And the answer is that someone has already
come to save us from ourselves, and that someone is Jesus. Several
announcements were made regarding the birth of Jesus. One of them was
from the angel Gabriel to Joseph: “She [Mary] will bring forth a Son,
and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from
their sins” (Matt. 1:21).

Jesus came—He did so to save us from our sin and from ourselves. His
name means “the Lord saves”—and our salvation was His mission. The
longing for rescue that fills the human heart ultimately is met by
Jesus.
