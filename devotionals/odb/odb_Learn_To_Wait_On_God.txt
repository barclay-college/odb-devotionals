Learn To Wait On God

My soul, wait silently for God alone, for my expectation is from Him.
—
Psalm 62:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 62:1-8

Cha Sa-soon, a 69-year-old Korean woman, finally received her driving
license after 3 years of trying to pass the written test. She wanted
the license so she could take her grandchildren to the zoo.

She was persistent in what is normally an instant world. When we want
something and cannot get it, we often complain and demand. At other
times, we give up and move on if what we want cannot be quickly
gratified. “Wait” is a word we hate to hear! Yet, many times the Bible
tells us that God wants us to wait on Him for the right timing.

Waiting on God means patiently looking to Him for what we need. David
recognized why he had to wait on the Lord. First, his salvation came
from Him (Ps. 62:1). He learned that no one else could deliver him.
His only hope was in God (v.5), for God alone hears our prayers (v.8).

Our prayers often revolve around asking God to hurry up and bless what
we want to do. What if God’s answer to us is simply, “Be patient. Wait
upon Me”? We can pray with David: “Listen to my voice in the morning,
Lord. Each morning I bring my requests to you and wait expectantly”
(Ps. 5:3 nlt). We can trust His response, even if it doesn’t come in
the time we expect.

Reflect & Pray

When we call out to You, O Lord, And wait for answers to our prayer,
Give us the patience that we need And help us sense Your love and
care. —Sper

The bottom line of every prayer should be, “Your will be done.”
