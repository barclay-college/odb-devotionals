Stronger than Hate

Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.
Luke 23:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 23:32–34, 44–46

Within twenty-four hours of his mother Sharonda’s tragic death, Chris
found himself uttering these powerful, grace-filled words: “Love is
stronger than hate.” His mother, along with eight others, had been
killed at a Wednesday night Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina.
What was it that had so shaped this teenager’s life that these words
could flow from his lips and his heart? Chris is a believer in Jesus
whose mother had “loved everybody with all her heart.”

In Luke 23:26–49 we get a front row seat to an execution scene that
included two criminals and the innocent Jesus (v. 32). All three were
crucified (v. 33). Amid the gasps and sighs and the likely groans from
those hanging on the crosses, the following words of Jesus could be
heard: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are
doing” (v. 34). The hate-filled initiative of the religious leaders
had resulted in the crucifixion of the very One who championed love.
Though in agony, Jesus’ love continued to triumph.

How have you or someone you love been the target of hate, ill-will,
bitterness, or ugliness? May your pain prompt your prayers, and may
the example of Jesus and people like Chris encourage you by the power
of the Spirit to choose love over hate.

Reflect & Pray

When have you found it hard to love someone? Is there someone you find
it hard to forgive now? What steps might you take?

Father, forgive me when I find it hard to forgive others. Help me to
demonstrate that love is stronger than hate.
