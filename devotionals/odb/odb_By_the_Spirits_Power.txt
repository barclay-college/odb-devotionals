By the Spirit’s Power

What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level
ground.
Zechariah 4:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Zechariah 4:1–7

What do you do when there is a mountain in your way? The story of
Dashrath Manjhi can inspire us. When his wife died because he was
unable to get her to the hospital to receive urgent medical care,
Manjhi did what seemed impossible. He spent twenty-two years chiseling
a massive gap in a mountain so other villagers could get to the local
hospital to receive the medical care they needed. Before he died, the
government of India celebrated him for his achievement.

Rebuilding the temple must have looked impossible to Zerubbabel, one
of the leaders of Israel who returned from exile. The people were
discouraged, faced opposition from their enemies, and lacked resources
or a big army. But God sent Zechariah to remind Zerubbabel that the
task would take something more powerful than military strength,
individual power, or man-made resources. It would take the Spirit’s
power (Zechariah 4:6). With the assurance of divine aid, Zerubbabel
trusted that God would level any mountain of difficulty that stood in
the way of rebuilding the temple and restoring the community (v. 7).

What do we do when there is a “mountain” before us? We have two
options: rely on our own strength or trust the Spirit’s power. When we
trust His power, He will either level the mountain or give us the
strength and endurance to climb over it.
