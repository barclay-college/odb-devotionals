Make It Personal

Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. —
Galatians 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Chronicles 24:1-2,15-22

During my days as a teacher and coach at a Christian high school, I
thoroughly enjoyed interacting with teenagers, trying to guide them to
a purposeful, Christlike life—characterized by love for God and love
for others. My goal was to prepare them to live for God throughout
life. That would happen only as they made their faith a vital part of
life through the help of the Holy Spirit. Those who didn’t follow
Christ floundered after they left the influence of Christian teachers
and parents.

This is demonstrated in the story of King Joash of Judah and his uncle
Jehoiada. Jehoiada, a wise counselor, influenced Joash to live a God-
honoring life (2 Chron. 24:11,14).

The problem was that Joash did not embrace an honorable life as his
own. After Jehoiada died, King Joash “left the house of the LORD”
(v.18) and began to worship in a pagan way. He turned and became so
evil that he had Jehoiada’s son murdered (vv.20–22).

Having someone in our lives to guide us toward faith and
Christlikeness can be good and helpful. Even better is getting to know
the Lord ourselves and learning to rely on the Holy Spirit to be our
guide (Gal. 5:16). That is making our faith personal.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for the people in my life who influence me toward
following You. Help me not to depend on them primarily—but to depend
on Your Holy Spirit to guide me.

The faith of others encourages; a faith of our own transforms.
