Hope Anyway

My comfort in my suffering is this: Your promise preserves my life.
Psalm 119:50

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:15–18

Among the hundreds of articles I’ve written for Our Daily Bread since
1988, a few stick in my mind. One such article is from the mid-1990s
when I told of a time our three girls were away at camp or on mission
trips, so six-year-old Steve and I had some guy time.

As we were enjoying an excursion to the airport, Steve turned to me
and said, “It’s not as much fun without Melissa,” his eight-year-old
sister and sidekick. Neither of us knew then how poignant those words
would turn out to be. Life indeed has not been “as much fun” for the
years since Mell died in a car accident as a teenager. The passage of
time may dull the ache, but nothing takes the pain away completely.
Time cannot heal that wound. But here’s something that can help:
listening to, meditating on, and savoring the solace promised by the
God of all comfort.

Listen: “Because of the L ord ’s great love we are not consumed, for
his compassions never fail” (Lamentations 3:22).

Meditate: “In the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling”
(Psalm 27:5).

Savor: “My comfort in my suffering is this: Your promise preserves my
life” (119:50).

Life can never be the same again when someone we love is gone. But
God’s promises bring hope and comfort.
