Sweet Company

The Spirit of truth . . . lives with you and will be in you.
John 14:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:15–26

The elderly woman in the nursing home didn’t speak to anyone or
request anything. It seemed she merely existed, rocking in her creaky
old chair. She didn’t have many visitors, so one young nurse would
often go into her room on her breaks. Without asking the woman
questions to try to get her to talk, she simply pulled up another
chair and rocked with her. After several months, the elderly woman
said to her, “Thank you for rocking with me.” She was grateful for the
companionship.

Before He went back to heaven, Jesus promised to send a constant
companion to His disciples. He told them He would not leave them alone
but would send the Holy Spirit to be in them (John 14:17). That
promise is still true for believers in Jesus today. Jesus said that
the triune God makes His “home” in us (v. 23).

The Lord is our close and faithful companion throughout our entire
life. He will guide us in our deepest struggles, forgive our sin, hear
each silent prayer, and shoulder the burdens we cannot bear.

We can enjoy His sweet company today.
