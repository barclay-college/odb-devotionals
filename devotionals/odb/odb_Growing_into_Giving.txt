Growing into Giving

Freely you have received; freely give.
Matthew 10:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 8:1–9

“I got you a present!” my two-year-old grandson shouted excitedly as
he pressed a box into my hands. “He picked it out all by himself,” my
wife smiled.

I opened the box to find a Christmas ornament of his favorite cartoon
character. “Can I see it?” he asked anxiously. Then he played with
“my” present for the rest of the evening, and as I watched him, I
smiled.

I smiled because I remembered gifts I had given loved ones in the
past, like the music album I gave my older brother one Christmas when
I was in high school that I really wanted to listen to (and did). And
I realized how years later God was still stretching me and teaching me
to give more unselfishly.

Giving is something we grow into. Paul wrote, “But since you excel in
everything . . . see that you also excel in this grace of giving” (2
Corinthians 8:7). Grace fills our giving as we understand that all we
have is from God, and He has shown us “it is more blessed to give than
to receive” (Acts 20:35).

God generously gave us the most unselfish gift of all: His only Son,
who would die on a cross for our sins and be raised to life. Any who
receive this ultimate gift are rich beyond measure. As our hearts are
focused on Him, our hands open in love to others.
