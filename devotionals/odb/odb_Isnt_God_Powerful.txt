“Isn’t God Powerful!”

Give unto the Lord the glory due to His name. —
Psalm 29:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 29

One day, my 3-year-old granddaughter Katie surprised her mom and dad
with a bit of theological expertise. She said to them, “You both had
sisters who died. Then God took them up to heaven to be with Him.
Isn’t God powerful!”

God’s immense power is a mystery, yet it is simple enough for a child
to understand. In Katie’s young way of thinking, she knew that for God
to do something so miraculous, it would mean that He is powerful.
Without understanding all the details, she knew that God did something
wonderful by taking her two aunts to heaven.

How often do we sit back in our more sophisticated world and marvel:
“Isn’t God powerful”? Probably not often enough. We can’t know how God
spun the worlds into existence with His voice (Job 38–39; Ps. 33:9;
Heb. 11:3), nor can we know how He maintains control of them (Neh.
9:6). We can’t know how He planned and fulfilled the incarnation of
Jesus, nor can we understand how He can make Christ’s sacrifice
sufficient for our salvation. But we know these things are true.

The power of God: immeasurable in its wonder yet clear enough for us
to understand. It’s yet another reason to praise Him.
