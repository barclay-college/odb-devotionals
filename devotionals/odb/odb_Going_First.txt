Going First

We love because he first loved us.
1 John 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:7–21

We worked patiently to help our son heal and adjust to his new life
with our family. Trauma from his early days in an orphanage was
fueling some negative behaviors. While I had enormous compassion for
the hardships he experienced in his early days, I felt myself begin to
withdraw from him emotionally because of those behaviors. Ashamed, I
shared my struggle with his therapist. Her gentle reply hit home: “He
needs you to go first . . . to show him he’s worthy of love before
he’ll be able to act like it.”

John pushes the recipients of his letter to an incredible depth of
love, citing God’s love as both the source and the reason for loving
one another (1 John 4:7, 11). I admit I often fail to show such love
to others, whether strangers, friends, or my own children. Yet John’s
words spark in me renewed desire and ability to do so: God went first.
He sent His Son to demonstrate the fullness of His love for each of
us. I’m so thankful He doesn’t respond as we all are prone to do by
withdrawing His heart from us.

Though our sinful actions don’t invite God’s love, He is unwavering in
offering it to us (Rom. 5:8). His “go-first” love compels us to love
one another in response to, and as a reflection of, that love.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for loving me in spite of my sin. Help me to “go
first” in loving others.

God loved us first so we can love others.
