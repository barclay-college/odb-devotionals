Don’t Run Alone

Since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses . . . let
us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
Hebrews 12:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 17:8-13

My husband Jack was on mile 25 out of 26 when his strength failed him.

This was his first marathon, and he was running alone. After stopping
for a drink of water at an aid station, he felt exhausted and sat down
on the grass beside the course. Minutes passed, and he couldn’t get
up. He had resigned himself to quitting the race when two middle-aged
schoolteachers from Kentucky came by. Although they were strangers,
they noticed Jack and asked if he wanted to run with them. Suddenly,
he found his strength restored. Jack stood and accompanied by the two
women he finished the race.

Those women who encouraged Jack remind me of Aaron and Hur, two
friends who helped Moses, the leader of the Israelites, at a key point
(Ex. 17:8–13). The Israelites were under attack. In battle, they were
winning only as long as Moses held his staff up (v. 11). So when
Moses’s strength began to fail, Aaron and Hur stood on either side of
him, holding up his arms for him until sunset (v. 12).

Following God is not a solo endeavor. He did not create us to run the
race of life alone. Companions can help us persevere through
difficulty as we do what God has called us to do.

Reflect & Pray

God, thank You for relationships that encourage me to continue
following You. Help me to be a source of strength for others, as well.

Who can I encourage to persevere through difficulty today?
