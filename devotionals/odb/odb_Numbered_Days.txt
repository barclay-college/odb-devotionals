Numbered Days

Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. —
Psalm 90:12

Today's Scripture: Psalm 90:7-17

In the aftermath of a devastating tornado, a man stood outside what
was left of his home. Scattered somewhere among the rubble inside were
his wife’s jewelry and his own valuable collectibles. But the man had
no intention of going inside the unstable house to search for them.
“It’s not worth dying for,” he said.

In times of crisis, our sense of what is truly important in life often
comes into clearer focus.

In Psalm 90, “A Prayer of Moses,” this man of God looks at life from
beginning to end. In light of the brevity of life (vv.4-6) and the
realization of God’s righteous anger (vv.7-11), Moses makes a plea to
God for understanding: “Teach us to number our days and recognize how
few they are; help us to spend them as we should” (v.12 tlb).

Moses continues this psalm with an appeal to God’s love: “Have
compassion on Your servants. Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy”
(vv.13-14). He concludes with a prayer for the future: “Let the beauty
of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands
for us” (v.17).

Our numbered days and the brevity of life call us to embrace God’s
eternal love and, like Moses, to focus on the most important things.
