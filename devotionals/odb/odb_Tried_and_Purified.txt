Tried and Purified

When he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
Job 23:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 23:1–12

During an interview, singer and songwriter Meredith Andrews spoke
about being overwhelmed as she tried to balance outreach, creative
work, marital issues, and motherhood. Reflecting on her distress, she
said, “I felt like God was taking me through a refining season, almost
through a crushing process.”

Job was overwhelmed after losing his livelihood, his health, and his
family. Worse still, although Job had been a daily worshiper of God,
he felt that the Lord was ignoring his pleas for help. God seemed
absent from the landscape of his life. Job claimed he could not see
God whether he looked to the north, south, east, or west (Job 23:2–9).

In the middle of his despair, Job had a moment of clarity. His faith
flickered to life like a candle in a dark room. He said, “[God] knows
the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold”
(v. 10). Christians are tried and purified when God uses difficulty to
burn away our self-reliance, pride, and earthly wisdom. If it seems as
if God is silent during this process and He is not answering our cries
for help, He may be giving us an opportunity to grow stronger in our
faith.

Pain and problems can produce the shining, rock-solid character that
comes from trusting God when life is hard.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me to believe that You are with me, even when I can’t
see You working in my life. I surrender myself to Your purpose for any
suffering I may endure.

Faith-testing times can be faith-strengthening times.
