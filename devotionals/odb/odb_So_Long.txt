So Long

[Do not] sorrow as others who have no hope. —
1 Thessalonians 4:13

Today's Scripture: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18

My grandfather refused to say “goodbye”; he felt the word was too
final. So, when we would drive away after family visits, his farewell
ritual was always the same. Standing in front of the green ferns that
lined his house, he would wave and call out, “So long”!

As believers, we never have to say “goodbye” to the ones we love, as
long as they have placed their trust in Jesus as Savior. The Bible
promises that we will see them again.

The apostle Paul said that we should not “sorrow as others who have no
hope” (1 Thess. 4:13), because when Jesus returns, the Christians who
have died will rise from their graves and—together with the believers
who are still alive—will meet the Lord in the air (vv.15-17). We have
confidence that one day in heaven there will be “no more death, nor
sorrow, nor crying” (Rev. 21:4). It’s in that wonderful place that “we
shall always be with the Lord” (1 Thess. 4:17).

Christians have the hope of an eternal reunion with Christ and with
believing loved ones who have passed away. That’s why Paul exhorted us
to “comfort one another with these words” (v.18). Today, encourage
someone with the hope that allows us to say “so long,” instead of
“goodbye.”
