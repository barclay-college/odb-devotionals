The Talking Tree

"He himself bore our sins" in his body on the cross.
1 Peter 2:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:15–20

One of the earliest Christian poems in English literature is “The
Dream of the Rood.” The word rood comes from the Old English word rod
or pole and refers to the cross on which Christ was crucified. In this
ancient poem the crucifixion story is retold from the perspective of
the cross. When the tree learns that it is to be used to kill the Son
of God, it rejects the idea of being used in this way. But Christ
enlists the help of the tree to provide redemption for all who will
believe.

In the garden of Eden, a tree was the source of the forbidden fruit
that our spiritual parents tasted, causing sin to enter the human
race. And when the Son of God shed His blood as the ultimate sacrifice
for all of humanity’s sin, He was nailed to a tree on our behalf.
Christ “bore our sins in his body on the cross” (1 Peter 2:24).

The cross is the turning point for all who trust Christ for salvation.
And ever since the crucifixion, it has become a remarkable symbol that
represents the sacrificial death of the Son of God for our deliverance
from sin and death. The cross is the inexpressibly wonderful evidence
of God’s love for us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, may my heart give You praise whenever I see a cross, for You
gave Yourself for me in love.

Christ gave His life on the tree for our salvation.
