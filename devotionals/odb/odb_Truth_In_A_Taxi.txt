Truth In A Taxi

I am the way, the truth, and the life. —
John 14:6

Today's Scripture: John 14:1-11

One day when I was in downtown Chicago, I hailed a taxi. Once inside,
I noticed several advertisements for a New Age guru posted on the seat
in front of me. The driver claimed that this mystic was the “divine
one” for our day. He believed that God appointed various leaders
throughout the ages, and that Jesus had merely been the appointee for
His time.

Of course, I had to disagree. As we talked, I mentioned Jesus’ words:
“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father
except through Me” (John 14:6). Contrary to the cabbie’s belief, Jesus
was not just one in a series of enlightened religious leaders—He is
the only way to know God, and only through Him can we get to heaven.

As the “Son of the living God” (Matt. 16:16), Jesus didn’t simply
declare Himself to be the ultimate spiritual authority. He proved it
with His death and resurrection. Christ “offered one sacrifice for
sins forever” (Heb. 10:12).

Jesus said of Himself: “I am in the Father and the Father in Me” (John
14:11). Therefore we don’t need to investigate any “new” path of
salvation. It’s better to learn all we can about Christ; He is the
only One who can provide spiritual certainty.

Reflect & Pray

My heart is stirred whene’er I think of Jesus, That blessed Name that
sets the captive free; The only Name through which I find salvation,
No name on earth has meant so much to me. —Eliason

Spiritual phonies will only take us for a ride, but Jesus will take us
all the way to heaven.
