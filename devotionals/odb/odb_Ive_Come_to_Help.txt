I’ve Come to Help

Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
James 1:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 1:19-27

Reporter Jacob Riis’s vivid descriptions of poverty in 19th-century
New York City horrified a generally complacent public. His book How
the Other Half Lives combined his writing with his own photographs to
paint a picture so vivid that the public could not escape the
certainty of poverty’s desperate existence. The third of fifteen
children himself, Riis wrote so effectively because he had lived in
that world of terrible despair.

Shortly after the release of his book, he received a card from a young
man just beginning his political career. The note read simply, “I have
read your book, and I have come to help. Theodore Roosevelt.” (This
politician later became a US President.)

True faith responds to the needs of others, according to James
(1:19-27). May our hearts be moved from inaction to action, from words
alone to deeds that back them up. Compassionate action not only aids
those mired in life’s difficulties, but it may also make them open to
the greater message from our Savior who sees their need and can do so
much more for them.

Reflect & Pray

O Lord, it is so easy to be overwhelmed, or to judge and therefore to
refrain from helping others. Lift our eyes above our own thoughts and
circumstances, and let us care as You care.

Others will know what the words “God is love” mean when they see it in
our lives.
