Mysterious Ways

As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than
your ways. —
Isaiah 55:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 40:1-14

When my son began attending Chinese language classes, I marveled at
the papers he brought home after his first session. As a native
English speaker, it was difficult for me to understand how the written
characters related to the spoken words. The language seemed incredibly
complex to me—almost incomprehensible.

Sometimes I feel the same sense of bewilderment when I consider the
way God operates. I know He has said, “My thoughts are not your
thoughts, nor are your ways My ways” (Isa. 55:8). Still, there’s a
part of me that feels like I should be able to understand why God
allows certain things to happen. After all, I read His Word regularly
and His Holy Spirit lives inside of me.

When I feel entitled to understand God’s ways, I try to recommit
myself to humility. I remember that Job did not get an explanation for
all his heartache (Job 1:5,8). He struggled to understand, but God
asked him: “Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him?”
(40:2). Job contritely responded, “What shall I answer You? I lay my
hand over my mouth” (v.4). Job was speechless before God’s greatness.

Although God’s ways may seem to be mysterious and unfathomable at
times, we can rest confidently that they are higher than our ways.

Reflect & Pray

Father, please help me to trust You even when I don’t understand why
things happen as they do. Please comfort my heart and remind me of
Your goodness and love.

If you know that God’s hand is in everything, you can leave everything
in God’s hand.
