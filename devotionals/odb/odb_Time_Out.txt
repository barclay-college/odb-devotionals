Time Out

Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them
away. —
Acts 13:3

Today's Scripture: Acts 11:19-26; 13:1-3

El Bulli restaurant, 2 hours north of Barcelona, is so popular that
customers must reserve a table 6 months in advance. But noted Spanish
chef Ferran Adrià decided to close the doors of his award-winning
restaurant for 2 years so he and his staff could have time to think,
plan, and innovate. Adrià told Hemispheres Magazine, “If we are
winning all the prizes, why change? Working 15 hours a day leaves us
very little time to create.” In the midst of great success, they took
time out for what is most important to them.

The first-century church in Antioch experienced a time of exciting
growth when “a great number believed and turned to the Lord” (Acts
11:21). As a result, Barnabas and Saul came to teach the new believers
(vv.25-26). But along with the hard work, they took time to seek the
Lord through prayer and fasting (13:2-3). Through this, God revealed
His plan for taking the gospel into Asia.

Few people can take 2 years off to think and plan. But all of us can
build time into our schedule to seek the Lord earnestly through
prayer. As we open our hearts and minds to God, He will be faithful to
reveal the steps of life and service that honor Him.

Reflect & Pray

There is a blessed calm at eventide That calls me from a world of toil
and care; How restful, then, to seek some quiet nook Where I can spend
a little time in prayer. —Bullock

Prayer is as important as breathing.
