Heart Food

Your words were found, and I ate them. —
Jeremiah 15:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 15:15-21

I love food! I love to see it beautifully presented, and I love to
savor the taste. If it were up to me, I would eat more often than I
should—although it wouldn’t help my waistline! So, it’s a good thing
my wife, Martie, knows when to lovingly remind me to eat healthful
foods in the right amount.

Reading Jeremiah’s interesting thought—that when he found the words of
God (even the words of God’s judgment) he “ate them” (Jer.
15:16)—makes me wonder if I ingest God’s Word as eagerly, as lovingly,
and as often.

Clearly, Jeremiah did not actually eat God’s Word. It was his way of
saying that he read and savored it in his innermost being. And that’s
exactly where God’s Word is intended to go. The Word is heart food!
When we ingest it, the Holy Spirit provides the power to help us grow
to be more like Jesus. His Word transforms how we think about God,
money, enemies, careers, and family. In other words, it’s really good
for us.

So, “eat” God’s Word to your heart’s content! No doubt you will find
yourself agreeing with the prophet Jeremiah when he said: “Your word
was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart” (15:16).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, cultivate in me an appetite for Your Word. Thank You that the
Bible is food for my soul. Lead me to read it, to savor it, to ingest
it, and to know the strength that Your words can give to my often-
failing heart.

The more you feast on God’s Word, the healthier you will become.
