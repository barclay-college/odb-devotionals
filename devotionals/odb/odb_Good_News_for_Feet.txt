Good News for Feet

For you, Lord, have delivered me from death . . . that I may walk
before the Lord in the land of the living.
Psalm 116:8–9

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 5:1–9

The ad brought a smile to my face: “The most comfortable socks in the
history of feet.” Then, extending its claim of good news for feet even
further, the advertiser said that because socks remain the most
requested clothing item at homeless shelters, for every pair of socks
purchased the company would donate a pair to someone in need.

Imagine the smile when Jesus healed the feet of a man who hadn’t been
able to walk for thirty-eight years (John 5:2–8). Now imagine the
opposite look on the faces of the temple officials who weren’t
impressed by Jesus’s care for the feet or heart of someone who had
gone without help for so long. They accused the man and Jesus of
breaking a religious law that allows no work to be done on the Sabbath
(vv. 9–10, 16–17). They saw rules where Jesus saw the need for mercy.

At this point the man didn’t even know who had given him new feet.
Only later would he be able to say that it was Jesus who had made him
well (vv. 13–15)—the same Jesus who would allow His own feet to be
nailed to a tree to offer that man—and us—the best news in the history
of broken bodies, minds, and hearts.
