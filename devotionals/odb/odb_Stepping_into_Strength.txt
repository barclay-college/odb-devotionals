Stepping into Strength

Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.
Colossians 4:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Chronicles 16:11–18, 28–36

“Will we see any snakes?”

Allan, a young boy in our neighborhood, asked that question as we
started on a hike by the river near our home.

“We never have before,” I answered, “but we might! So let’s ask God to
keep us safe.” We paused, prayed together, and kept walking.

Several minutes later my wife, Cari, suddenly took a quick step
backward, narrowly avoiding a poisonous copperhead partially coiled on
the path ahead. We waited as the snake left the trail, giving it a
wide berth. Then we paused and thanked God nothing had happened. I
believe that through Allan’s question, God had prepared us for the
encounter, and our prayer was part of His providential care.

Our brush with danger that evening brings to mind the importance of
David’s words: “Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face
always” (1 Chron. 16:11). This advice was part of a psalm celebrating
the return of the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. It recounts God’s
faithfulness to His people in their struggles throughout history,
reminding them to always praise Him and “cry out” to Him (v. 35).

What does it mean to “seek [God’s] face”? It means we turn our hearts
toward Him in even the most mundane moments. Sometimes our prayers are
answered differently than our asking, but God is faithful come what
may. Our Good Shepherd will direct our paths and keeps us in His
mercy, strength, and love. May we declare our dependence on Him.
