Open My Eyes

The Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you
all things.
John 14:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:23–31

The first time I went to the gorgeous Chora Church in Istanbul, I was
able to figure out some Bible stories from the Byzantine frescos and
mosaics on the ceiling. But there was much I missed. The second time,
however, I had a guide. He pointed to all the details I had previously
missed, and suddenly everything made perfect sense! The first aisle,
for instance, depicted the life of Jesus as recorded in the gospel of
Luke.

Sometimes when we read the Bible we understand the basic stories, but
what about the connections—those details that weave Scripture into the
one perfect story? We have Bible commentaries and study tools, yes,
but we also need a guide—someone to open our eyes and help us see the
wonders of God’s written revelation. Our guide is the Holy Spirit who
teaches us “all things” (John 14:26). Paul wrote that He explains
“spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words” (1 Corinthians 2:13).

How wonderful to have the Author of the Book to show us the wonders of
it! God has not only given us His written Word and His revelation but
He also helps us to understand it and learn from it. So let us pray
with the psalmist, saying, “Open my eyes that I may see wonderful
things in your law” (Psalm 119:18).
