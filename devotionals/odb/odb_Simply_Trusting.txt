Simply Trusting

Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You. —
Psalm 56:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 56

When our children were young, taking them to the doctor’s office was
an interesting experience. The waiting room was filled with toys they
could play with and children’s magazines I would read to them. So
getting that far with them was no problem. But as soon as I picked
them up to carry them into the appointment, everything changed.
Suddenly the fun turned into fear as the nurse approached with the
needle for the needed shot. The closer she got, the tighter they
hugged my neck. They would cling to me for comfort, probably hoping
for rescue, not knowing that it was for their own good.

Sometimes in this fallen world we move from times of peace and
tranquility into the painful realm of trouble. At that point, the
question is, “How will I respond?” We can be fearful and wonder why
God allowed this to happen to us, or we can trust that in the midst of
this trouble He is doing something that in the end is for our best,
even if it hurts. We would do well to remember the words of the
psalmist who wrote, “Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You” (Ps.
56:3).

Like my children, the tougher it gets, the tighter we should hug His
neck. Trust Him. His love never fails!

Reflect & Pray

Come quickly, Lord, to help me. Teach me to trust You in times of
trouble. Remind me of Your presence and of the fact that You hold me
in Your loving arms.

Cling to your heavenly Father; He is your only hope.
