Secret Menu

I have food to eat that you know nothing about.
John 4:32

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 4:31-34

Meat Mountain is a super-sandwich layered with six kinds of meat.
Stacked with chicken tenders, three strips of bacon, two cheeses, and
much more, it looks like it should be a restaurant’s featured item.

But Meat Mountain isn’t on any restaurant’s published menu. The
sandwich represents a trend in off-menu items known only by social
media or word of mouth. It seems that competition is driving fast-food
restaurants to offer a secret menu to in-the-know customers.

When Jesus told His disciples that He had “food” they knew nothing
about, it must have seemed like a secret menu to them (John 4:32). He
sensed their confusion and explained that His food was to do the will
of His Father and to finish the work given to Him (v. 34).

Jesus had just spoken to a Samaritan woman at Jacob’s well about
living water she had never heard of. As they talked, He revealed a
supernatural understanding of her unquenched thirst for life. When He
disclosed who He was, she left her water pot behind and ran to ask her
neighbors, “Could this be the Messiah?” (v. 29).

What was once a secret can now be offered to everyone. Jesus invites
all of us to trust His ability to satisfy the deepest needs of our
hearts. As we do, we discover how to live not just by our physical
appetites but by the soul-satisfying Spirit of our God.
