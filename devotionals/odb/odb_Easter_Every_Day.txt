Easter Every Day

He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. —
Matthew 28:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 10:11-18

A friend of mine, who is a preschool teacher, overheard an animated
conversation among her students. Little Maria threw out the question:
“Who loves God?” All of them responded, “I do! I do! I do!” Billy
said, “I love Jesus.” Kelly protested, “But He died.” Billy said,
“Yeah, but every Easter He rises from the dead!”

Obviously, young Billy’s understanding of the meaning of Easter is
still developing. We know that Jesus died once for all (Rom. 6:10;
Heb. 10:12) and, of course, rose from the dead once. Three days after
paying the penalty of our sins on the cross, the sinless Jesus
conquered death by rising from the grave and breaking the power of
sin. It was this final sacrifice of blood that opened the only way for
us to have a relationship with God now and a home with Him
forevermore.

“Christ died for our sins, . . . He was buried, and . . . He rose
again the third day” (1 Cor. 15:3-4). He has promised that He is
preparing a place for us (John 14:1-4), and He will someday return.
One day we will be with our risen Savior.

That’s why every year at Eastertime—in fact, every day of the year—we
have reason to celebrate the resurrection of our Savior. “I will bless
the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth”
(Ps. 34:1).
