It’s All a Gift!

For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not
from yourselves, it is the gift of God.
Ephesians 2:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:1–9

London’s Café Rendezvous has nice lighting, comfortable couches, and
the smell of coffee in the air. What it doesn’t have are prices.
Originally started as a business by a local church, the café was
transformed a year after it started. The managers felt that God was
calling them to do something radical—make everything on the menu free.
Today you can order a coffee, cake, or sandwich without cost. There
isn’t even a donation jar. It’s all a gift.

I asked the manager why they were so generous. “We’re just trying to
treat people the way God treats us,” he said. “God gives to us whether
we thank him or not. He’s generous to us beyond our imaginations.”

Jesus died to rescue us from our sins and reconcile us with God. He
rose from the grave and is alive now. Because of this, every wrong
thing we’ve done can be forgiven, and we can have new life today (Eph.
2:1–5). And one of the most amazing things about this is that it is
all free. We can’t buy the new life Jesus offers. We can’t even donate
toward the cost (vv. 8–9). It’s all a gift.

As the folks at Café Rendezvous serve their cakes and coffees, they
give people a glimpse of God’s generosity. You and I are offered
eternal life for free because Jesus has paid the bill.

Reflect & Pray

Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the
free gift of the water of life. Revelation 22:17

Eternal life is a free gift ready to be received.
