Michael’s Baptism

Let the little children come to Me. —
Mark 10:14

Today's Scripture: Mark 10:13-16

Michael wanted to be baptized. At first his father had reservations
about this because Michael is autistic. Autism is a developmental
disability that affects a person’s social interaction and
communication skills.

There was no question that 35-year-old Michael had trusted Jesus for
salvation, and the church leadership enthusiastically approved his
baptism. But he would have to stand in front of the entire
congregation.

Knowing that Michael didn’t like surprises, his dad reviewed all that
would happen. But during the baptism, when the pastor said, “Michael,
I baptize you in the name of the Father,” Michael interrupted as if to
remind him, “and the Son!” The congregation smiled with joy. And
Michael was baptized in obedience to Christ’s command.

Each of us comes to Jesus at a different level of spiritual
understanding, and Jesus extends His welcome to all who respond. When
little children approached the Savior, His disciples tried to send
them away. But Christ rebuked them and said, “Let the little children
come to Me” (Mark 10:14). And that also applies to the developmentally
disabled.

The gospel is simple. The Savior is approachable. And His invitation
is open to everyone.
