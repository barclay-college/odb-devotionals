Unsend

Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from
evil and their lips from deceitful speech.
1 Peter 3:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 3:8–12

Have you ever sent an email and suddenly realized it went to the wrong
person or it contained harmful, harsh words? If only you could press a
key and stop it. Well, now you can. Several companies offer a feature
that gives you a brief time after sending an email to stop it from
leaving your computer. After that, the email is like a spoken word
that cannot be unsaid. Rather than being seen as a cure-all, an
“unsend” feature should remind us that it’s extremely important to
guard what we say.

In the apostle Peter’s first letter, he told the followers of Jesus,
“Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary,
repay evil with blessing. . . . For, ‘whoever would love life and see
good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from
deceitful speech. They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek
peace and pursue it’ ” (1 Peter 3:9–11).

The psalmist David wrote, “Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch
over the door of my lips” (Ps. 141:3). That’s a great prayer for the
beginning of each day and in every situation when we want to strike
back with words.

Lord, guard our words today so we may not harm others by what we say.

Reflect & Pray

Father, teach us first to guard our hearts so that we may guard our
tongues. And help us, when we do say things we regret, to humbly
apologize and seek forgiveness.

The tongue has the power of life and death.  Proverbs 18:21
