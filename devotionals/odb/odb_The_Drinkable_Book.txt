The Drinkable Book

The water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up
to eternal life.
John 4:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 4:7–15

Because it is so difficult in parts of the world to find clean
drinking water, an organization called Water Is Life developed a
wonderful resource called “The Drinkable Book.” The paper in the book
is coated in silver nanoparticles that filter out almost 99.9 percent
of harmful bacteria! Each tear-out page can be used and reused to
filter up to 100 liters of water at the cost of only four pennies per
page.

The Bible is also an unusually “drinkable” Book. In John 4, we read of
a particular kind of thirst and a special kind of water. The woman at
the well needed much more than to quench her physical thirst with
clean, clear liquid. She was desperate to know the source of “living
water.” She needed the grace and forgiveness that comes from God
alone.

God’s Word is the ultimate “drinkable” Book that points to God’s Son
as the sole source of “living water.” And those who accept the water
that Jesus gives will experience “a spring of water welling up to
eternal life” (v. 14).

Reflect & Pray

Father, we yearn for the satisfaction that only You can give. Help us
discard the things that leave us empty and thirsting, and exchange
them for the satisfaction of the living water You offer. Tell us your
story of how you came to know Jesus as the Living Water at odb.org or
Facebook.com/ourdailybread.

Jesus is the sole source of living water.
