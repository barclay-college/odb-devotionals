We Shall Be Changed

We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. —
1 John 3:2

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 4:16–5:8

Being afflicted with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, Thomas DeBaggio
chronicled his gradual memory loss in the book Losing My Mind. This
book records the disturbing process by which—little by little—tasks,
places, and people are all forgotten.

Alzheimer’s disease involves the failure of nerve cells in the brain,
leading to gradual memory loss, confusion, and disorientation. It can
be tragic to watch a previously mentally alert person slowly forget
how to dress or fail to recognize the faces of loved ones. It’s like
losing the person before he dies.

Memory loss can occur by other means as well, such as injury or life
trauma. And for those of us who live into old age, the breakdown of
our bodies is inevitable.

But for the Christian, there is hope. When believers receive their
glorified bodies at the resurrection, they will be perfect (2 Cor.
5:1-5). But even more important, in heaven we will recognize the One
who died to redeem us. We will remember what He did and know Him by
the nail prints in His hands (John 20:25; 1 Cor. 13:12).

Forgetfulness may beset our earthly bodies, but when we see the Lord,
“We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is” (1 John 3:2).
