Spiritual Checkup

Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and
with all your mind and with all your strength.
Mark 12:30

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:1-14

To detect health problems before they become serious, doctors
recommend a routine physical exam. We can do the same for our
spiritual health by asking a few questions rooted in the great
commandment (Mark 12:30) Jesus referred to.

Do I love God with all my heart because He first loved me? Which is
stronger, my desire for earthly gain or the treasures that are mine in
Christ? (Col. 3:1). He desires that His peace rule our hearts.

Do I love God with all my soul? Do I listen to God telling me who I
am? Am I moving away from self-centered desires? (v. 5). Am I becoming
more compassionate, kind, humble, gentle, and patient? (v. 12).

Do I love God with all my mind? Do I focus on my relationship with His
Son or do I let my mind wander wherever it wants to go? (v. 2). Do my
thoughts lead to problems or solutions? To unity or division?
Forgiveness or revenge? (v. 13).

Do I love God with all my strength? Am I willing to be seen as weak so
that God can show His strength on my behalf? (v. 17). Am I relying on
His grace to be strong in His Spirit?

As we let “the message of Christ dwell among [us] richly . . . with
all wisdom” (v. 16), He will equip us to build each other up as we
become spiritually fit and useful to Him.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, when I rely on anything other than love in my efforts
to initiate change in people, I am neglecting to love You with all my
heart, soul, mind, and strength. I choose today to exchange my
strength for Yours.

To be spiritually fit, feed on God’s Word and exercise your faith.
