Divine Perspective

For the vision is yet for an appointed time; . . . it will surely
come. —
Habakkuk 2:3

Today's Scripture: Habakkuk 2:2-14

Jason took a trip to New York during spring break. One afternoon he
and some friends piled into a cab and headed for the Empire State
Building. To Jason, the ride on the ground seemed chaotic and
dangerous. But when he got to the observation deck of the skyscraper
and looked down on the city streets, to his amazement he saw order and
design. What a difference a change in perspective made!

Habakkuk learned a similar lesson. When he looked at life from his
earthly vantage point, it seemed that God was indifferent to the evil
permeating society (Hab. 1:2-4). But God gave him a divine perspective
and showed him that life is more than what it seems. The deeds of men
cannot thwart the purposes of God (2:3).

Those who don’t show any regard for God may seem to prosper at the
moment, but God will ultimately right all wrong. God acts sovereignly
in all that comes to pass so that everything works toward His good
purpose. God’s plan will surely take place and be on schedule (v.3).

We can’t sort out the whole picture from where we are in life; only
God can. So let us continue to live by faith and not by sight. From
His perspective, all things are working together for the believer’s
good and for His honor.
