Our Safe Place

I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in
whom I trust.”
Psalm 91:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 91

My very first job was at a fast-food restaurant. One Saturday evening,
a guy kept hanging around, asking when I got out of work. It made me
feel uneasy. As the hour grew later, he ordered fries, then a drink,
so the manager wouldn’t kick him out. Though I didn’t live far, I was
scared to walk home alone through a couple of dark parking lots and a
stretch through a sandy field. Finally, at midnight, I went in the
office to make a phone call.

And the person who answered—my dad—without a second thought got out of
a warm bed and five minutes later was there to take me home.

The kind of certainty I had that my dad would come to help me that
night reminds me of the assurance we read about in Psalm 91. Our
Father in heaven is always with us, protecting and caring for us when
we are confused or afraid or in need. He declares: “When they call on
me, I will answer” (Psalm 91:15 nlt ). He is not just a place we can
run to for safety. He is our shelter (v. 1). He is the Rock we can
cling to for refuge (v. 2).

In times of fear, danger, or uncertainty, we can trust God’s promise
that when we call on Him, He will hear and be with us in our trouble
(vv. 14–15). God is our safe place.
