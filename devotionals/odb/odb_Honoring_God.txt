Honoring God

[Jesus said,] “If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much
fruit.
John 15:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 15:1-5

The church service was still in progress, and we had some visitors
there that morning. The speaker was only halfway through his sermon
when I noticed one of our visitors walking out. I was curious and
concerned, so I walked out to talk with her.

“You’re leaving so soon,” I said, approaching her. “Is there a problem
I can help with?” She was frank and forthright. “Yes,” she said, “my
problem is that sermon! I don’t accept what the preacher is saying.” 
He had said that no matter what we accomplish in life, the credit and
praise belong to God. “At least,” the woman moaned, “I deserve some
credit for my achievements!”

I explained to her what the pastor meant. People do deserve
recognition and appreciation for what they do. Yet even our gifts and
talents are from God, so He gets the glory. Even Jesus, the Son of
God, said, “The Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he
sees his Father doing” (John 5:19). He told His followers, “Apart from
me you can do nothing” (15:5).

We acknowledge the Lord as the one who helps us to accomplish
everything.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, let me not forget to acknowledge You for all that You do for me
and enable me to do.

God’s children do His will for His glory.
