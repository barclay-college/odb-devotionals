Better Than a Piñata

By grace you have been saved.
Ephesians 2:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:1–10

There cannot be a Mexican party without a piñata—a carton or clay
container filled with candies and treats. Children strike it with a
stick and try to break it, hoping to enjoy its contents.

Monks used the piñatas in the sixteenth century to teach lessons to
the indigenous people of Mexico. Piñatas were stars with seven points
that represented the seven deadly sins. Beating the piñata showed the
struggle against evil, and once the treats inside fell to the ground,
people could take them home in remembrance of the rewards of keeping
the faith.

But we cannot fight evil on our own. God is not waiting for our
efforts so that He will show His mercy. Ephesians teaches that “by
grace you have been saved through faith, . . . it is the gift of God”
(2:8). We don’t beat sin; Christ has done that.

Children fight for the candies from the piñata, but God’s gifts come
to all of us when we believe in Jesus. God “has blessed us . . . with
every spiritual blessing” (1:3). We have forgiveness of sins,
redemption, adoption, new life, joy, love, and much more. We don’t get
these spiritual blessings because we have kept the faith and are
strong; we get them because we believe in Jesus. Spiritual blessings
come only through grace—undeserved grace!
