Looking And Learning

Train up a child in the way he should go. —
Proverbs 22:6

Today's Scripture: Deut. 11:18-21

As an umpire stood behind the plate at a girls’ softball game, he
heard a player’s mother start chanting: “We want a new ump! We want a
new ump!” Soon, other parents took up the chant. The ump smiled, then
turned toward the crowd and yelled, “I want new parents! I want new
parents!” The heckling died away.

It’s important for parents to set a good example, because their
children are watching them. Christian parents can encourage good
habits and behavior by doing things like:

• Praying for and with them—so they learn how to talk with God.
“Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it” (Col. 4:2).

• Reading and teaching them the Bible—so they learn God’s truth.
“Teach [God’s commands] diligently to your children, . . . talk of
them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you
lie down, and when you rise up” (Deut. 6:7).

• Telling them about Jesus—and leading them to faith in Him. “Unless
one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (John 3:3).

The best way to set a good example for our children is to live out our
faith in front of them. While they’re looking—they’re learning about
what matters most.

Reflect & Pray

Take stock of yourself and consider your child— Your time and your
thoughts are his due; How would you reply to the Lord should He ask,
“What kind of parent are you?” —Anon.

Children may not inherit their parents’ talent, but they will absorb
their values.
