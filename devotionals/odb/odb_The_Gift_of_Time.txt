The Gift of Time

A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be
refreshed.
Proverbs 11:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 6:37–38

I headed into the post office in a big hurry. I had a number of things
on my to-do list, but as I entered I was frustrated to find a long
line backing up all the way to the door. “Hurry up and wait,” I
muttered, glancing at my watch.

My hand was still on the door when an elderly stranger approached me.
“I can’t get this copier to work,” he said, pointing to the machine
behind us. “It took my money and I don’t know what to do.” Immediately
I knew what God wanted me to do. I stepped out of line and was able to
fix the problem in ten minutes.

The man thanked me and then left. As I turned to get back in line, it
was gone. I walked straight to the service counter.

My experience that day reminds me of Jesus’s words: “Give, and it will
be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and
running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you
use, it will be measured to you” (Luke 6:38).

My wait seemed shorter because God interrupted my hurry. By turning my
eyes to others’ needs and helping me give of my time, He gave me a
gift. It’s a lesson I hope to remember, next time I look at my watch.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, all of the time I have is in Your hands, a gift from
You. Please show me how to use it to bring glory and honor to You.

Sometimes our to-do list needs to wait.
