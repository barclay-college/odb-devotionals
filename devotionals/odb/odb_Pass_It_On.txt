Pass It On

As you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of
the consolation. —
2 Corinthians 1:7

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 1:3-7

I’ve noticed through the years that those who have suffered are quick
to comfort other sufferers. When a young couple suffers the loss of a
child, another couple who also lost a child in the past asks if they
can help. If a couple loses their main income, almost immediately
another couple steps forward to offer their aid, remembering their own
journey through foreclosure years earlier. Again and again we see the
body of Christ supporting and encouraging one another. These
Christians have learned that they can use the trials they’ve been
through to reach out to others going through similar difficulties.

Have you been sick? Lost a loved one? Been imprisoned? Unfairly
treated? In all of our trials, God promises to bring something good
out of even our darkest moments (James 1:2-4). One key way this takes
place is when we share the comfort He offered us with those who are
now going through trials.

As Paul points out in 2 Corinthians 1:3-7, we are comforted by a
Savior who knows our suffering, and we honor Him when we pass His
comfort on to still others.

May we never leave someone to suffer alone. If we know the trail
another is on, God will help us to guide that person to His
presence—the surest comfort of all.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help us to step forward when others around us are suffering
trials similar to what we’ve been through. Enable us to be a comfort,
as You have been to us in the past.

God comforts us so that we can comfort others.
