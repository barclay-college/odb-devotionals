Consumer Mentality

If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a
reward. —
1 Corinthians 3:14

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 3:5-15

I like to read, and I enjoy buying books. But I don’t like it when
publishers refer to me as a “consumer.” The word consume can mean “do
away with completely” or “spend wastefully.” It brings to mind forest
fires that devour acre after acre of vegetation, leaving behind only
scorched remnants of trees and homes. When we read books, we don’t
consume them in that sense, for they don’t cease to exist after we’ve
used them. In fact, quite the opposite is true. They become a part of
us; they change us.

This is especially true of the Bible. When the words of Scripture
remain in us, they keep us from taking the destructive way of sin (Ps.
119:11). Jesus said that when His words abide in us, we will bear much
fruit (John 15:5-8). In other words, we will be creators, not
consumers; givers, not takers.

The apostle Paul referred to Christians as “God’s fellow workers” (1
Cor. 3:9), who are to build things that cannot be consumed in the fire
of God’s judgment of their works (vv.13-15). Later he urged readers to
excel in gifts that build up the church (14:12).

As Christians, let’s be known not for the goods we consume but for the
good fruit we produce.

Reflect & Pray

Thinking It Over Why does God give us spiritual gifts? (Eph. 4:11-13).
On what are we to build our works? (1 Cor. 3:10-11). What is the
result of work that will last? (1 Cor. 3:14).

A selfless life reaps an eternal harvest.
