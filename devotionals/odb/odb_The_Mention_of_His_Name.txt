The Mention of His Name

I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away
your joy.
John 16:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 16:17-24

When the soloist began to sing during our Sunday service, the
congregation gave him full, hushed attention. His mellow bass-baritone
voice brought them the soul-touching words of an old song by Gordon
Jensen. The song’s title expresses a truth that grows more precious
the older we become: “He’s as Close as the Mention of His Name.”

We’ve all experienced times of separation from our loved ones. A child
marries and moves far away. Parents are separated from us because of
career or health. A child goes off to school in another state or
country. True, we have texting and Skype. But we are here and they are
there. And then there is the separation of death.

But as believers in Christ, we have His promise that we are never
alone. Though we may feel alone, He hasn’t gone anywhere. He’s right
here, right now, always and forever. When He left this earth, He told
His followers, “Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the
age” (Matt. 28:20). He also promised us, “Never will I leave you;
never will I forsake you” (Heb. 13:5).

The silent plea, the whispered mention of His name, even the very
thought of Him brings us solace and reassurance. “He’s as close as the
mention of His name.”
