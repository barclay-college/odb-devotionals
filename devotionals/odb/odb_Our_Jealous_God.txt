Our Jealous God

The Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
Exodus 34:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 11:1-4

In 2014 a University of California researcher used a stuffed dog to
show that animals are capable of jealousy. Professor Christine Harris
asked dog owners to show affection for a stuffed animal in the
presence of their pet. She found that three-fourths of the dogs
responded with apparent envy. Some tried to get attention with touch
or a gentle nudge. Others tried to push between their owner and the
toy. A few went so far as to snap at their stuffed rival.

In a dog, jealousy seems heartwarming. In people, it can lead to less
admirable results. Yet, as Moses and Paul remind us, there is also
another jealousy—one that beautifully reflects the heart of God.

When Paul wrote to the church at Corinth, he said he was “jealous for
you with a godly jealousy” (2 Cor. 11:2). He didn’t want them to be
“led astray from [their] sincere and pure devotion to Christ” (v. 3).
Such jealousy reflects the heart of God, who told Moses in the Ten
Commandments, “I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God” (Ex. 20:5).

God’s jealousy is not like our self-centered love. His heart expresses
His protective zeal for those who are His by creation and salvation.
He made us and rescued us to know and enjoy Him forever. How could we
ask for anything more than a God who is so zealous—and jealous—for our
happiness?

Reflect & Pray

Father, help me shun anything that distracts me from You, so that I
may always find enjoyment in who You are and in Your plan for me.

God loves every one of us as if there were but one of us to love.
Augustine
