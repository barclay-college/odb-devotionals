More Than Just Waiting

[Jesus] gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for
the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.”
Acts 1:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 1:4–11

Police charged a woman with reckless driving after she drove off the
street and onto the sidewalk and back because she didn’t want to wait
for a school bus dropping off students!

While it’s true that waiting can make us impatient, there are also
good things to do and learn in the waiting. Jesus knew this when He
told His disciples to “not leave Jerusalem” (Acts 1:4). They were
waiting to “be baptized with the Holy Spirit” (v. 5).

As they gathered in an upper room, likely in a state of excitement and
anticipation, the disciples seemed to understand that when Jesus told
them to wait, He didn’t say for them to do nothing. They spent time
praying (v. 14); and informed by Scripture, they also chose a new
disciple to replace Judas (v. 26). When they were joined together in
worship and prayer, the Holy Spirit descended upon them (2:1–4).

The disciples hadn’t simply been waiting—they’d also been preparing.
As we wait on God, it doesn’t mean doing nothing or impatiently
rushing forward. Instead we can pray, worship, and enjoy fellowship as
we anticipate what He’ll do. The waiting prepares our hearts, minds,
and bodies for what’s to come.

Yes, when God asks us to wait, we can be excited—knowing that we can
trust Him and the plans He has for us!

Reflect & Pray

Do you find yourself in a season of waiting? How can you see this as a
season of preparation instead?

God, when I’m struggling, remind me that the seasons of waiting aren’t
for nothing but help to reveal Your loving handiwork in my life.
