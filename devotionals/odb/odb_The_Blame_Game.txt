The Blame Game

The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold! The
Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! —
John 1:29

Today's Scripture: Leviticus 16:5-22

I’ve been blamed for a lot of things, and rightly so. My sin, failure,
and incompetence have caused grief, anxiety, and inconvenience for
friends and family (and probably even for strangers). I’ve also been
blamed for things that were not my fault, things I was powerless to
change.

But I have stood on the other side of the fence hurling accusations at
others. If they had just done something different, I tell myself, I
would not be in the mess I’m in. Blame hurts. So whether guilty or
not, we waste lots of time and mental energy trying to find someone
else to carry it for us.

Jesus offers us a better way to deal with blame. Even though He was
blameless, He took upon Himself the sin of the world and carried it
away (John 1:29). We often refer to Jesus as the sacrificial lamb, but
He was also the final scapegoat for everything that is wrong with the
world (Lev. 16:10).

Once we acknowledge our sin and accept Christ’s offer to take it away,
we no longer have to carry the weight of our guilt. We can stop
looking for someone to blame for what’s wrong with us, and we can stop
accepting blame from others trying to do the same.

Thanks to Jesus, we can stop playing the blame game.

Reflect & Pray

Help me, Lord, to be honest when I am at fault and to confess that to
You—instead of looking for someone else to blame. Thank You for taking
my blame on Yourself.

Honesty about our sin brings forgiveness.
