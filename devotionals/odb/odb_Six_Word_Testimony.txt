Six-Word Testimony

One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see. —
John 9:25

Today's Scripture: John 9:1-11,24-25

Over the past 15 years, Dan Smith’s name and face have appeared on
fliers in coffee shops, laundromats, and small businesses across New
York City. The six-word slogan on each flier says: Dan Smith Will
Teach You Guitar. The result is that Mr. Smith stays as busy as he
wants to be, teaching his students how to play the guitar. Many
enthusiastic students hang his fliers in new places. It’s their way of
saying, “Dan Smith taught me guitar. He can teach you too.”

The pages of the Bible are filled with accounts of people telling what
God has done for them. One of the most vivid appears in John 9 where
Jesus encountered a man blind from birth and miraculously enabled him
to see (vv.1-7). After repeated questioning by skeptical local
religious leaders, the man could only say, “One thing I know: that
though I was blind, now I see” (v.25).

If you had six words to express what Christ has done for you and can
do for others, what would you say? Perhaps, “Jesus Christ will forgive
your sin,” or “. . . give you hope” or “. . . save your soul.” When
Jesus has changed our lives, we affirm His power to do for others what
He has done for us.

“I was blind, now I see.”
