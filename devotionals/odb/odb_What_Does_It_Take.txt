What Does It Take?

Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall
rest. —
Exodus 23:12

Today's Scripture: Genesis 2:1-7

Today’s technology allows some people to work 24/7. We can bring our
work home or take it on vacation. Work is ever-present with us—except
when the electricity goes off.

An ice storm last winter covered several states in a thick glasslike
glaze. Trees and branches fell, blocking roads and keeping people
home. Power lines fell, leaving people in cold darkness, unable to
accomplish anything that required electricity.

Whenever something like this interrupts my life, I realize how
important my own work is to me. Without it, I feel unimportant,
unproductive, and useless. But God doesn’t want work to be that
important to us, and we shouldn’t need a power outage to get us to
stop. In the Old Testament, God had a plan for getting His people to
stop and pay attention to Him. It was called Sabbath. On the seventh
day of the week, they were to stop their work (Ex. 23:12).

Although New Testament believers aren’t required to keep this law,
rest is still important. Practicing a day of rest can keep us from the
faulty belief that our work is more important than God’s.

What does it take to make you stop and pay attention to God?

Reflect & Pray

He gives me work that I may seek His rest, He gives me strength to
meet the hardest test; And as I walk in providential grace, I find
that joy goes with me, at God’s pace. —Gustafson

If we do not come apart and rest awhile, we may just plain come apart.
—Havner
