The Trouble With Heroes

I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. —
Psalm 139:14

Today's Scripture: Psalm 139:1-14

When I was a kid, I had a hero: Pete Maravich, a high-scoring
basketball player who handled the ball like a magician.

Problem was, my desire to be like Pistol Pete blocked my satisfaction
with who God made me to be. When I realized I could never play like
Pete, I grew discouraged. I even quit my college team briefly because
I couldn’t measure up to the Maravich standard.

Kids still do that kind of thing. They grow unhappy with who God made
them to be because they measure themselves by their “perfect” heroes.

Christian singer Jonny Diaz recognized this and wrote a song called
“More Beautiful You.” The song begins: “Little girl fourteen flipping
through a magazine; says she wants to look that way.” Some young girls
wish they could be like Disney star Selena Gomez or another star the
way I wanted to be like Maravich. Diaz sings, “There could never be a
more beautiful you; don’t buy the lies . . . ; you were made to fill a
purpose that only you could do.” Diaz is saying what another
songwriter said under the inspiration of God thousands of years ago:
“[We are] fearfully and wonderfully made” (Ps. 139:14).

God made us the way He wants us to be. Believe it. There could never
be a more beautiful you.

Lord, we are Yours, You are our God; We have been made so wondrously;
This human frame in every part Your wisdom, power, and love we see.

We are beautiful masterpieces designed by God.
