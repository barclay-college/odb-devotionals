Invisible Influence

Do not quench the Spirit.
1 Thessalonians 5:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:16–24

On a visit to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, I saw a
masterpiece called The Wind. The painting showed a storm moving
through a wooded area. Tall, thin trees leaned to the left. Bushes
thrashed in the same direction.

In an even more powerful sense, the Holy Spirit is able to sway
believers in the direction of God’s goodness and truth. If we go along
with the Spirit, we can expect to become more courageous and more
loving. We will also become more discerning about how to handle our
desires (2 Tim. 1:7).

In some situations, however, the Spirit nudges us toward spiritual
growth and change, but we respond with a “no.” Continually
stonewalling this conviction is what Scripture calls “quench[ing] the
Spirit” (1 Thess. 5:19). Over time, things we once considered wrong
appear not to be quite as bad.

When our relationship with God seems distant and disconnected, this
may be because the Spirit’s conviction has been repeatedly brushed
aside. The longer this goes on, the harder it is to see the root of
the problem. Thankfully, we can pray and ask God to show us our sin.
If we turn away from sin and recommit ourselves to Him, God will
forgive us and revive the power and influence of His Spirit within us.

Reflect & Pray

God, show me how I have resisted Your Holy Spirit. Help me to listen
when You speak. I want to be right with You again.

Yielding to the Holy Spirit leads to right living.
