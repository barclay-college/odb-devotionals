Resurrection And Life

I am the resurrection and the life. —
John 11:25

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 15:1-11

Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life”! It’s one thing to
make such a bold assertion; it’s another to back it up—and back it up
Jesus did by rising from the dead.

“If you believe that the Son of God died and rose again,” writes
George MacDonald, “your whole future is full of the dawn of eternal
morning, coming up beyond the hills of life, and full of such hope as
the highest imagination for the poet has not a glimmer yet.”

The Son of God died and rose again, and His resurrection is the
guarantee that God will bring us up and out of the ground: A thinking,
feeling, remembering, recognizable person will live forever.

Living forever means living out the thought of eternity that God has
placed in our hearts; meeting again one’s believing loved ones lost
through separating death; living in a world without sorrow; seeing our
Lord who loves us and gave everything to unite us to Him forever.

But I see another meaning. Since we have this life and the next, we
don’t have to “have it all” now. We can live in broken and ruined
bodies for a time; we can endure poverty and hardship for a while; we
can face loneliness, heartache, and pain for a season. Why? There is a
second birth—life in heaven forever.
