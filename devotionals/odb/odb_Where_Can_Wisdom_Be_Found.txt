Where Can Wisdom Be Found?

If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God. —
James 1:5

Today's Scripture: James 3:13-17

Wisdom is the beauty of holiness. James says wisdom is reasonable;
flexible; forgiving; peaceful; caring; given to friendly visits, small
acts of courtesy, and kind words. It is humble, transparent, simple,
gentle, and gracious to the core (James 3:17).

Where can wisdom be found? It comes from heaven (1:5). “Wisdom,” wrote
Charles Spurgeon, “is a beauty of life that can only be produced by
God’s workmanship in us.”

It’s good to ask from time to time: “Am I growing in wisdom?” After
all, life is relentlessly dynamic. We’re either growing sweeter and
wiser as the days go by, or we’re growing into foolish or even sour-
faced curmudgeons. Into what are we growing?

It’s never too late to begin growing in wisdom. God loves us with an
ardent, intense affection that can deliver us from our foolishness if
we yield ourselves to Him. His love can make the most difficult nature
into a miracle of astonishing beauty. It may hurt a little and it may
take a while, but God relentlessly seeks our transformation. When we
ask, His wisdom will begin to rise in us and pour itself out to
others.

We have this promise: “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God,
who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given
to [you]” (1:5).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please put an end to our foolishness and turn our hearts toward
the wisdom that comes only from You. We ask You now to take our lives
and transform them into Your likeness.

True wisdom begins and ends with God.
