Remember The Wrapping

[Jesus] made Himself of no reputation . . . coming in the likeness of
men. —
Philippians 2:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:5-11

At our house some Christmas events are the same each year. Among them
is my wife Martie’s appeal to the kids and grandkids as they attack
their gifts: “Save the paper, we can use it next year!” Martie loves
to give nice gifts, but she also appreciates the wrapping.
Presentation is part of the beauty of the gift.

It makes me think of the wrapping Christ chose when He came as a
redemptive gift to rescue us from our sinful selves. Jesus could have
wrapped Himself in a mind-boggling show of power, lighting up the sky
with His presence in a celestial show of glory. Instead, in a
beautiful reversal of Genesis 1:26, He chose to wrap Himself “in the
likeness of men” (Phil. 2:7).

So why is this wrapping so important? Because, being like us, He is no
stranger to our struggles. He experienced deep loneliness and the
betrayal of a dear friend. He was publicly shamed, misunderstood, and
falsely accused. In short, He feels our pain. As a result, the writer
of Hebrews tells us that we can “come boldly to the throne of grace,
that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (Heb.
4:16).

When you think of the gift of Jesus this Christmas, remember to keep
the “wrapping” in mind!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for wrapping Yourself in our likeness! Remind us that
You understand our struggles and that we can confidently take
advantage of the mercy and grace You offer to make us victorious.

Don’t disregard the wrapping of the best Christmas gift of all.
