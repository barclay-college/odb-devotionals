Consider The Clouds

Do you know how the clouds are balanced? —
Job 37:16

Today's Scripture: Job 37:1-16

One day many years ago my boys and I were lying on our backs in the
yard watching the clouds drift by. “Dad,” one asked, “why do clouds
float?” “Well, son,” I began, intending to give him the benefit of my
vast knowledge, but then I lapsed into silence. “I don’t know,” I
admitted, “but I’ll find out for you.”

The answer, I discovered, is that condensed moisture, descending by
gravity, meets warmer temperatures rising from the land. That moisture
then changes into vapor and ascends back into the air. That’s a
natural explanation for the phenomenon.

But natural explanations are not final answers. Clouds float because
God in His wisdom has ordered the natural laws in such a way that they
reveal the “wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge” (Job
37:16). Clouds then can be thought of as a symbol—an outward and
visible sign of God’s goodness and grace in creation.

So someday when you’re taking some time to see what images you can
imagine in the clouds, remember this: The One who made all things
beautiful makes the clouds float through the air. He does so to call
us to wonder and adoration. The heavens—even the cumulus, stratus, and
cirrus clouds—declare the glory of God.

Reflect & Pray

The Lord’s creation you’ll adore As you observe each day unfold; Let
your imagination soar As you His handiwork behold. —Branon

Creation is filled with signs that point to the Creator.
