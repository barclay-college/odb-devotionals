Yesterday, Today, And Tomorrow

That all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the Lord, that
it is mighty. —
Joshua 4:24

Today's Scripture: Joshua 4:1-6,20-24

Recently I realized that all of the photos and mementos in my office
represent the past. I considered removing them, but wondered if those
reminders of people, places, and events might serve some purpose
beyond nostalgia. To avoid being mired in the “yesterdays” of life, I
needed to discover the value of those items for today and tomorrow.

When God’s people crossed the Jordan River into the Promised Land, He
told their leader, Joshua, to choose 12 men, have each one take a
stone from the middle of the river, and carry it to their campsite
that night (Josh. 4:1-5). Joshua set up the stones as a memorial so
that when future generations asked, “What do these stones mean to
you?” they could tell them about God’s faithfulness in holding back
the water while they crossed (vv.6-7).

As followers of Christ, it’s good for us to have tangible evidence of
God’s help in the past. Those mementos remind us that His faithfulness
continues today, and we can follow Him confidently into the future.
Our “stones” may also help others know that God’s hand is mighty, as
they encourage us to fear the Lord our God forever (v.24).

The memories of what God has done for us can become building blocks
for today and tomorrow.

Reflect & Pray

Thinking It Over How has God shown Himself to be faithful to you and
your family? What would help you to remember? Is there someone you can
talk to about it today?

Precious memories of yesterday can strengthen our faith today and
tomorrow.
