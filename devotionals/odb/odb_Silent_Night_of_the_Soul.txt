Silent Night of the Soul

If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone;
the new is here!
2 Corinthians 5:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 5:14–21

Long before Joseph Mohr and Franz Gruber created the familiar carol
“Silent Night,” Angelus Silesius had written:

Lo! in the silent night a child to God is born, And all is brought
again that ere was lost or lorn. Could but thy soul, O man, become a
silent night God would be born in thee and set all things aright.

Silesius, a Polish monk, published the poem in 1657 in The Cherubic
Pilgrim. During our church’s annual Christmas Eve service, the choir
sang a beautiful rendition of the song titled “Could but Thy Soul
Become a Silent Night.”

The twofold mystery of Christmas is that God became one of us so that
we might become one with Him. Jesus suffered everything that was wrong
so that we could be made right. That’s why the apostle Paul could
write, “If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has
gone; the new is here! All this is from God who reconciled us to
himself through Christ” (2 Cor. 5:17–18).

Whether our Christmas is filled with family and friends or empty of
all we long for, we know that Jesus came to be born in us.

Ah, would thy heart but be a manger for the birth, God would once more
become a child on earth.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, thank You for being born into this dark world so that we
might be born again into Your life and light.

God became one of us so that we might become one with Him.
