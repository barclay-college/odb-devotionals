Make a Joyful Noise

Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth, burst into jubilant song
with music.
Psalm 98:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 98

Back when I was searching for a church to attend regularly, a friend
invited me to a service at her church. The worship leaders led the
congregation in a song I particularly loved. So I sang with gusto,
remembering my college choir director’s advice to “Project!”

After the song, my friend’s husband turned to me and said, “You really
sang loud.” This remark was not intended as a compliment! After that,
I self-consciously monitored my singing, making sure I sang softer
than those around me and always wondering if the people around me
judged my singing.

But one Sunday, I noticed the singing of a woman in the pew beside me.
She seemed to sing with adoration, without a trace of self-
consciousness. Her worship reminded me of the enthusiastic,
spontaneous worship that David demonstrated in his life. In Psalm 98,
in fact, David suggests that “all the earth” should “burst into
jubilant song” in worship (v. 4).

Verse one of Psalm 98 tells us why we should worship joyfully,
reminding us that “[God] has done marvelous things.” Throughout the
psalm, David recounts these marvelous things: God’s faithfulness and
justice to all nations, His mercy, and salvation. Dwelling on who God
is and what He’s done can fill our hearts with praise.

What “marvelous things” has God done in your life? Thanksgiving is the
perfect time to recall His wondrous works and give God thanks. Lift
your voice and sing!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for who You are and for what You’ve done.

Worship takes the focus off us and places it where it belongs—on God.
