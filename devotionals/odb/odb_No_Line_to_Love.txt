No Line to Love

I have made you and I will carry you.
Isaiah 46:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 46:3–10

Sometimes when my Labrador retriever wants attention, he’ll take
something of mine and parade it in front of me. One morning as I was
writing at the desk with my back turned, Max snatched my wallet and
ran off. But realizing I hadn’t seen him do it, he returned and nudged
me with his nose—wallet in mouth, eyes dancing, tail wagging, taunting
me to play.

Max’s antics made me laugh, but they also reminded me of my
limitations when it comes to being attentive to others. So often I’ve
intended to spend time with family or friends, but other things occupy
my time and awareness; and before I know it the day slips away and
love is left undone.

How comforting to know that our heavenly Father is so great that He’s
able to attend to each of us in the most intimate ways—even sustaining
every breath in our lungs for as long as we live. He promises His
people, “Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will
sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you” (Isaiah 46:4).

God always has time for us. He understands every detail of our
circumstances—no matter how complex or difficult—and is there whenever
we call on Him in prayer. We never have to wait in line for our
Savior’s unlimited love.

Reflect & Pray

In what ways does God take care of your daily needs? How can you share
His love with others?

You always have time for me, Jesus. Please help me to live every
moment for You!
