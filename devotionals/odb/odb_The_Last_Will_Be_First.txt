The Last Will Be First

Those who humble themselves will be exalted.
Matthew 23:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 9:33–37

Recently I was among the last in line to board a large passenger jet
with unassigned seating. I located a middle seat beside the wing, but
the only spot for my bag was the overhead compartment by the very last
row. This meant I had to wait for everyone to leave before I could go
back and retrieve it.

I laughed as I settled into my seat and a thought occurred to me that
seemed to be from the Lord: “It really won’t hurt you to wait. It will
actually do you good.” So I resolved to enjoy the extra time, helping
other passengers lower their luggage after we landed and assisting a
flight attendant with cleaning. By the time I was able to retrieve my
bag, I laughed again when someone thought I worked for the airline.

That day’s experience made me ponder Jesus’s words to His disciples:
“Anyone who wants to be first, must be the very last, and the servant
of all” (Mark 9:35).

I waited because I had to, but in Jesus’s “upside down” kingdom,
there’s a place of honor for those who voluntarily set themselves
aside to attend to others’ needs.

Jesus came into our hurried, me-first world not “to be served, but to
serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matt. 20:28). We
serve Him best by serving others. The lower we bend, the closer we are
to Him.

Reflect & Pray

Loving Lord, help me to follow You into the needs of others and serve
You there.

Jesus’s kingdom is upside-down.
