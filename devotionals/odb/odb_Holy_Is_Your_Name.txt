Holy Is Your Name

You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.
Exodus 20:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 20:1-7

One afternoon I was having a discussion with a friend I considered my
spiritual mentor about misusing God’s name. “You shall not misuse the
name of the Lord your God,” says the third commandment (Ex. 20:7). We
may think this only refers to attaching God’s name to a swear word or
using His name flippantly or irreverently. But my mentor rarely missed
an opportunity to teach me about real faith. He challenged me to think
about other ways we profane God’s name.

When I reject the advice of others and say, “God told me to go this
way,” I misuse His name if all I am doing is seeking approval for my
own desires.

When I use Scripture out of context to try to support an idea I want
to be true, I am using God’s name in vain.

When I teach, write, or speak from Scripture carelessly, I misuse His
name.

Author John Piper offers this reflection on what it means to take
God’s name in vain: “The idea is . . . ‘don’t empty the name.’ . . .
Don’t empty God of His weight and glory.” We misuse His name, Piper
says, when we “speak of God in a way that empties Him of His
significance.”

My friend challenged me to honor God’s name and to pay closer
attention to using His Word carefully and accurately. Anything less
dishonors Him.
