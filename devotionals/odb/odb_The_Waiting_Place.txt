The Waiting Place

Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him.
Psalm 37:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 70

“Waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for wind to fly a kite. Or
waiting around for Friday night . . . . Everyone is just waiting”—or
so Dr. Seuss, author of many children’s books, says.

So much of life is about waiting, but God is never in a hurry—or so it
seems. “God has His hour and delay,” suggests an old, reliable saying.
Thus we wait.

Waiting is hard. We twiddle our thumbs, shuffle our feet, stifle our
yawns, heave long sighs, and fret inwardly in frustration. Why must I
live with this awkward person, this tedious job, this embarrassing
behavior, this health issue that will not go away? Why doesn’t God
come through?

God’s answer: “Wait awhile and see what I will do.”

Waiting is one of life’s best teachers for in it we learn the virtue
of . . . well, waiting—waiting while God works in us and for us. It’s
in waiting that we develop endurance, the ability to trust God’s love
and goodness, even when things aren’t going our way (Psalm 70:5).

But waiting is not dreary, teeth-clenched resignation. We can “rejoice
and be glad in [Him]” while we wait (v. 4). We wait in hope, knowing
that God will deliver us in due time—in this world or in the next. God
is never in a hurry, but He’s always on time.
