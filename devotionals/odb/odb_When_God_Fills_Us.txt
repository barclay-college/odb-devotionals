When God Fills Us

You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in
your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
Psalm 16:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 16:5–11

“What had I done?” It should have been one of the most exciting times
of my life. Instead, it was one of the loneliest. I’d just gotten my
first “real” job after college, in a city hundreds of miles from where
I grew up. But the thrill of that big step quickly faded. I had a tiny
apartment. No furniture. I didn’t know the city. I didn’t know anyone.
The job was interesting, but the loneliness felt crushing.

One night, I sat at home with my back against the wall. I opened my
Bible and stumbled onto Psalm 16, where verse 11 promises God will
fill us. “Lord,” I prayed, “I thought this job was the right thing,
but I feel so alone. Please fill me with a sense of Your nearness.” I
offered variants of that plaintive plea for weeks. Some nights, my
sense of loneliness eased, and I had a deep experience of God’s
presence. Other nights, I still felt achingly isolated.

But as I returned to that verse, anchoring my heart in it night by
night, God gradually deepened my faith. I experienced His faithfulness
in a way I never had before. And I learned that my job was simply to
pour out my heart to Him . . . and humbly await His faithful response,
trusting His promise to fill us with His Spirit.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we can feel so empty at times. But You’ve made known the path of
life. You long for us to trust You. Help us to cling to Your promise
to fill us in our desperate moments.

Anchor your heart in God.
