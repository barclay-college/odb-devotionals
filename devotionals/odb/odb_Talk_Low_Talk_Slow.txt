Talk Low, Talk Slow

A soft answer turns away wrath. —
Proverbs 15:1

Today's Scripture: Judges 7:24–8:3

John Wayne, famous American actor and film icon, once said, “Talk low,
talk slow, and don’t say too much.” His advice is hard for me to
follow since I’m a fast talker and I don’t always speak quietly or
limit my words. However, this idea of controlling our speech can be a
useful tool when dealing with anger. The Bible says we are supposed to
be “slow to speak” (James 1:19), and that “a soft answer turns away
wrath” (Prov. 15:1).

Gideon gave a soft answer during a verbal scuffle with some fellow
Israelites (Judg. 8). Just after his army defeated the Midianites, a
group of his countrymen criticized him sharply (v.1). They were miffed
because they missed out on the main part of the battle. Gideon did not
fling back a rough response. Instead, he reminded them that they had
captured and killed the Midianite princes. He also honored the men by
asking, “What was I able to do in comparison with you?” Finally,
“their anger toward him subsided when he said that” (v.3).

With the Lord’s help, we can defuse heated situations by reining in
our words. Responding gently and carefully to angry people can promote
unity, for God’s glory.
