Enjoy the View

Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars.
Psalm 148:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 148:1–6

Sunsets. People tend to stop what they are doing to watch them . . .
snap pictures of them . . . enjoy the beautiful view.

My wife and I watched the sun setting over the Gulf of Mexico
recently. A crowd of people surrounded us, mostly strangers who had
gathered at the beach to watch this nightly phenomenon. At the moment
the sun fully slipped below the horizon, the crowd broke out with
applause.

Why do people respond like that? The book of Psalms offers a clue. The
psalmist wrote of God ordering the sun to praise its Creator (Ps.
148:3). And wherever the rays of the sun shine across the earth,
people are moved to praise along with them.

The beauty that comes to us through nature speaks to our souls like
few things do. It not only has the capacity to stop us in our tracks
and captivate our attention, it also has the power to turn our focus
to the Maker of beauty itself.

The wonder of God’s vast creation can cause us to pause and remember
what’s truly important. Ultimately, it reminds us that there is a
Creator behind the stunning entrance and exit of the day, One who so
loved the world He made that He entered it in order to redeem and
restore it.
