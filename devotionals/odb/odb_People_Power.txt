People Power

The whole body . . . grows and builds itself up in love, as each part
does its work.
Ephesians 4:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:7-16

A man was boarding a train in Perth, Australia, when he slipped and
his leg got caught in the gap between the train carriage and the
station platform. Dozens of passengers quickly came to his rescue.
They used their sheer might to tilt the train away from the platform,
and the trapped man was freed! The train service’s spokesman, David
Hynes, said in an interview, “Everyone sort of pitched in. It was
people power that saved someone from possibly quite serious injury.”

In Ephesians 4, we read that people power is God’s plan for building
up His family. He has given each of us a special gift of His grace (v.
7) for the specific purpose that “the whole body, joined and held
together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in
love, as each part does its work” (v. 16).

Every person has a job to do in God’s family; there are no spectators.
In God’s family we weep and laugh together. We bear each other’s
burdens. We pray for and encourage one another. We challenge and help
each other to turn from sin. Show us, Father, our part in helping Your
family today.

Reflect & Pray

Are you a spectator or a participant? What gifts do you have? In what
ways can God use you to help others grow closer to Him?

We need each other to get to where God wants us to go.
