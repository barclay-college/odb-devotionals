Something’s Wrong

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed
in spirit.
Psalm 34:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:11–18

The morning after our son, Allen, was born, the doctor sat down in a
chair near the foot of my bed and said, “Something’s wrong.” Our son,
so perfect on the outside, had a life-threatening birth defect and
needed to be flown to a hospital 700 miles away for immediate surgery.

When the doctor tells you something is wrong with your child, your
life changes. Fear of what lies ahead can crush your spirit and you
stumble along, desperate for a God who will strengthen you so you can
support your child.

Would a loving God allow this? you wonder. Does He care about my
child? Is He there? These and other thoughts shook my faith that
morning.

Then my husband, Hiram, arrived and heard the news. After the doctor
left, Hiram said, “Jolene, let’s pray.” I nodded and he took my hand.
“Thank You, Father, for giving Allen to us. He’s Yours, God, not ours.
You loved him before we knew him, and he belongs to You. Be with him
when we can’t. Amen.”

Hiram has always been a man of few words. He struggles to speak his
thoughts and often doesn’t try, knowing that I have enough words to
fill any silence. But on a day when my heart was broken, my spirit
crushed, and my faith gone, God gave Hiram strength to speak the words
I couldn’t say. And clinging to my husband’s hand, in deep silence and
through many tears, I sensed that God was very near.
