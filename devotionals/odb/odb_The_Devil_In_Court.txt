The Devil In Court

I have removed your iniquity from you. —
Zechariah 3:4

Today's Scripture: Zechariah 3:1-5

The Devil and Daniel Webster” is a short story by Stephen Vincent
Benet. In it, Jabez Stone, a New England farmer, has such “bad luck”
that he sells his soul to the devil to become prosperous. Eventually,
the devil comes to collect Jabez’s debt. But the eminent lawyer Daniel
Webster is called in to defend him. Through a skillful series of
arguments, Webster wins the case against the devil, and Jabez is saved
from perdition.

Of course, this tale is only fiction. But the Bible records a vision
in which Satan accuses a believer before the Divine Judge. Joshua, a
high priest, stands before God. As a picture of his personal sin and
guilt, the priest is dressed in filthy clothing. Nearby, Satan accuses
Joshua. But the Angel of the Lord rebukes him and says to Joshua:
“See, I have removed your iniquity from you, and I will clothe you
with rich robes” (Zech. 3:4).

Only God can make a sinner acceptable to Him. And the New Testament
tells us how: “If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous” (1 John 2:1).

Do you feel unworthy to enter the presence of God? Remember, as
Christians, our Savior’s blood has cleansed us, and Christ Himself
represents us.

Reflect & Pray

The power of God can turn a heart From evil and the power of sin; The
love of God can change a life And make it new and cleansed within.

Justification means our guilt gone, Christ’s righteousness given.
