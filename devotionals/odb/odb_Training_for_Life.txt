Training for Life

For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver.
Psalm 66:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 66:8–12

My training for the long-distance race was going badly, and the latest
run was particularly disappointing. I walked half the time and even
had to sit down at one point. It felt like I had failed a mini-test.

Then I remembered that this was the whole point of training. It was
not a test to pass, nor was there a grade I had to achieve. Rather, it
was something I simply had to go through, again and again, to improve
my endurance.

Perhaps you feel bad about a trial you are facing. God allows us to
undergo these times of testing to toughen our spiritual muscles and
endurance. He teaches us to rely on Him, and purifies us to be holy,
so that we become more like Christ.

No wonder the psalmist could praise God for refining the Israelites
through fire and water (Ps. 66:10–12) as they suffered in slavery and
exile. God not only preserved them and brought them to a place of
great abundance, but also purified them in the process.

As we go through testing, we can rely on God for strength and
perseverance. He is refining us through our toughest moments.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I know that You allow me to go through trials so that I will be
strengthened and purified. Teach me to keep relying on You for Your
strength to endure.

Faith-testing times can be faith-strengthening times.
