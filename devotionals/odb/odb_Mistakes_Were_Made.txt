Mistakes Were Made

They gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this
calf!
Exodus 32:24

Today's Scripture: Exodus 32:1–5, 19–26

“Mistakes were made,” said the CEO as he discussed the illegal
activity his company had been involved in. He looked regretful, yet he
kept blame at arm’s length and couldn’t admit he had personally done
anything wrong.

Some “mistakes” are just mistakes: driving in the wrong direction,
forgetting to set a timer and burning dinner, miscalculating your
checkbook balance. But then there are the deliberate deeds that go far
beyond—God calls those sin. When God questioned Adam and Eve about why
they had disobeyed Him, they quickly tried to shift the blame to
another (Gen. 3:8–13). Aaron took no personal responsibility when the
people built a golden calf to worship in the desert. He explained to
Moses, “[The people] gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire,
and out came this calf!” (Ex. 32:24).

He might as well have muttered, “Mistakes were made.”

Sometimes it seems easier to blame someone else rather than admitting
our own failings. Equally dangerous is to try to minimize our sin by
calling it “just a mistake” instead of acknowledging its true nature.

But when we take responsibility—acknowledging our sin and confessing
it—the One who “is faithful and just . . . will forgive us our sins
and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). Our God offers
His children forgiveness and restoration.
