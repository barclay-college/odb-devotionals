Memory Loss

Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures
forever. —
Psalm 118:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 118:1-14

Sometimes when we face times of trouble, we may get spiritual amnesia
and forget the grace of God. But a good way of reestablishing a
thankful heart is to set aside undistracted time and deliberately
remember God’s past provisions for us and give thanks.

When the children of Israel found themselves in a barren, hot desert,
they developed memory loss about the grace of God. They began to wish
they were back in Egypt, enjoying all its foods (Ex. 16:2-3) and later
complained about their water supply (17:2). They had forgotten the
mighty acts of God in their deliverance and how He had showered them
with wealth (12:36). They were dwelling on their current circumstances
and forgetting God’s gracious past provision.

The psalmist challenges us: “Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is
good! For His mercy endures forever” (Ps. 118:1). The word mercy means
“steadfast love.” It refers to God’s faithfulness. He has promised to
be present always to care for His children.

By remembering specific ways God has provided for us in the past, we
can change our perspective for the better. God’s steadfast love
endures forever!

Reflect & Pray

Wait on the Lord from day to day, Strength He provides in His own way;
There’s no need for worry, no need to fear, He is our God who is
always near. —Fortna

Remembering God’s provision for yesterday gives hope and strength for
today.
