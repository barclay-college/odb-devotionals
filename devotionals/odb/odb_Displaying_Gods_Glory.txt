Displaying God’s Glory

Those who live according to the Spirit, [live according to] the things
of the Spirit. —
Romans 8:5

Today's Scripture: Romans 8:1-10

I love baseball and have been a fan of the sport since I was a little
kid. I especially enjoy following the Detroit Tigers. But during a
recent season, the Tigers’ poor play and losing record early in the
season frustrated me greatly. So for my own personal well-being, I
took a break. I spent 4 days avoiding anything to do with my favorite
team.

During those 4 Tiger-less days, I began to contemplate how difficult
it is to give up things we’ve grown accustomed to. Yet there are times
when God may want us to.

For instance, we may be involved in an activity that has become all-
encompassing—and we know it would be best to limit it (see 1 Cor.
6:12). Or we may have a habit or practice that we know misses the mark
of pleasing God, and we realize that we need to let it go because we
love Him and want Him to be glorified through us (15:34).

When we do find things that interfere with our relationship with the
Lord, with His help we can stop. God has given us the provision (1
Cor. 10:13), and the Spirit provides the power (Rom. 8:5).

Let’s ask Him to help us not let anything block His glory from shining
through.

Reflect & Pray

You are perfect, Lord, and we are so far from perfect. Please chip
away at our imperfections through the work of Your Holy Spirit. Help
us each day to grow more and more like You.

Drawing close to Christ produces a growing Christlikeness.
