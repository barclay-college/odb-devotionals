The Anchor Of Our Hope

This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast. —
Hebrews 6:19

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 6:13-20

Frank, Ted, and I were fishing for bluegill on Rice Lake in Ontario,
Canada. We were on a pontoon boat, and the fish were really biting.
Busy baiting and hooking, we slowly became aware that the action had
slacked off. Then we realized why: The boat was no longer sitting
where we had put it. A strong wind had come up and pushed it across
the water. The anchor could not hold us and was sliding across the
lake bottom. We hauled it up, returned to our hot spot, and re-
anchored. We were moved away again. After a third try, we went back to
shore. We could not get our anchor to grab and stick.

When it comes to our salvation, our hope is anchored in the promise of
God and the work of Jesus Christ. The winds and waves of doubt,
discouragement, and spiritual attack by the evil one can cause us to
think that we are adrift and salvation from God is not secure. Not so!
God has given His promise that our salvation is sure, and He cannot
lie (Heb. 6:18-19). Our hope is securely fastened in Jesus Christ who
redeemed us once and for all when He died, rose again, and ascended to
heaven.

Our anchor is the Rock unmovable—Jesus Christ. His limitless love
holds us sure and steadfast.

By:  David C. Egner

Reflect & Pray

We have an anchor that keeps the soul, Steadfast and sure while the
billows roll; Fastened to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm
and deep in the Savior’s love. —Owens

Our anchor is the Rock, Jesus Christ.
