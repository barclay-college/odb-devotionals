Rest Into It

Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. —
Matthew 11:28

Today's Scripture: Romans 8:31-39

The most enjoyable part of the stretch-and-flex exercise class I
attend is the last 5 minutes. That’s when we lie flat on our backs on
our mats with the lights down low for relaxation. During one of those
times, our instructor said softly, “Find a place where you can rest
into.” I thought of the best place to “rest into” mentioned in the
words of a hymn by Cleland B. McAfee, “Near to the Heart of God.”

There is a place of quiet rest, Near to the heart of God, A place
where sin cannot molest, Near to the heart of God. O Jesus, blest
Redeemer, Sent from the heart of God, Hold us who wait before Thee
Near to the heart of God.

This hymn was written in 1901 after the death of McAfee’s two nieces
from diphtheria. His church choir sang it outside the quarantined home
of his brother, offering words of hope about God’s heart of care.

The apostle Paul tells us that God has a heart of love for us (Rom.
8:31-39). Nothing—tribulation, distress, persecution, famine,
nakedness, peril, sword, death, life, angels, principalities, powers,
height, nor depth—is able to separate us from the enduring love of our
Lord. “If God is for us, who can be against us?” (v.31).

Whatever our stresses or concerns, the heart of God is the place to
“rest into.” Leave it all with Him, “for He cares for you” (1 Peter
5:7).
