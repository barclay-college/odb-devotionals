Overcoming Fear

Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of
the Lord our God.
Psalm 20:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Samuel 17:4–7, 45–50

Fear ruled a man’s life for thirty-two years. Afraid of being caught
for his crimes, he hid at his sister’s farmhouse, going nowhere and
visiting no one, even missing his mother’s funeral. When he was sixty-
four, he learned that no charges had ever been filed against him. The
man was free to resume a normal life. Yes, the threat of punishment
was real, but he allowed the fear of it to control him.

Likewise, fear ruled the Israelites when the Philistines challenged
them at the Valley of Elah. The threat was real. Their enemy Goliath
was 9 feet 9 inches tall and his body armor alone weighed 125 pounds
(1 Samuel 17:4–5). For forty days, every morning and evening, Goliath
challenged the Israelite army to fight him. But no one dared come
forward. No one until David visited the battle lines. He heard and saw
the taunting, and volunteered to fight Goliath.

While everyone in the Israelite army thought Goliath was too big to
fight, David the shepherd boy knew he wasn’t too big for God. He said,
“the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord ’s” (v. 47).

When we’re gripped by fear, let’s follow David’s example and fix our
eyes on God to gain a right perspective of the problem. The threat may
be real, but the One who is with us and for us is bigger than that
which is against us.

Reflect & Pray

What giant battle are you facing that’s crippling you in fear? How can
you intentionally fix your eyes on the living God?

Thank You, God, that You’re bigger than any other giant in my life. I
trust You.
