The Twelfth Man

Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
Hebrews 12:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 11:32–12:3

A large sign at the Texas A&M University football stadium says “HOME
OF THE 12TH MAN.” While each team is allowed eleven players on the
field, the 12th Man is the presence of thousands of A&M students who
remain standing during the entire game to cheer their team on. The
tradition traces its roots to 1922 when the coach called a student
from the stands to suit up and be ready to replace an injured player.
Although he never entered the game, his willing presence on the
sideline greatly encouraged the team.

Hebrews 11 describes heroes of the faith who faced great trials and
remained loyal to God. Chapter 12 begins, “Therefore, since we are
surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off
everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let
us run with perseverance the race marked out for us” (v. 1).

We are not alone on our journey of faith. The great saints and
ordinary people who have been faithful to the Lord encourage us by
their example and also by their presence in heaven. They are a
spiritual 12th Man standing with us while we are still on the field.

As we fix our eyes on Jesus, “the pioneer and perfecter of faith”
(12:2), we are spurred on by all those who followed Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, may we be aware of those in heaven who are cheering us on. Give
us strength to run our race of faith today.

Faithful Christians from the past encourage us today.
