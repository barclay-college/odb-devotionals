Friendship

A friend loves at all times. —
Proverbs 17:17

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 23:14-18

Friendship is one of life’s greatest gifts. True friends seek a
special kind of good for their friends: the highest good, which is
that they might know God and love Him with all of their heart, soul,
and mind. German pastor and martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, “The aim
of friendship is exclusively determined by what God’s will is for the
other person.”

Jonathan, David’s friend, is a sterling example of true friendship.
David was in exile, hiding in the Desert of Ziph, when he learned that
“Saul had come out to seek his life” (1 Sam. 23:15). Jonathan went to
Horesh to find David. The significance of this scene lies in
Jonathan’s intent: He helped David find strength in God or, as the
text puts it, he “strengthened his hand [grip] in God” (v.16).

That is the essence of Christian friendship. Beyond common interests,
beyond affection, beyond wit and laughter is the ultimate aim of
sowing in others the words of eternal life, leaving them with
reminders of God’s wisdom, refreshing their spirit with words of His
love, and strengthening their grip on God.

Pray for your friends and ask God to give you a word “in season” to
help them find renewed strength in our God and His Word.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for loving us. May Your love compel us to show
love to others. Give us sensitivity to Your Spirit that we might know
how to encourage them in their walk with You.

A true friend is a gift from God and one who points us back to Him.
