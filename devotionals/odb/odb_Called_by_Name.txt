Called by Name

Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned toward him and cried out in
Aramaic, “Rabboni!”
John 20:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 20:11–18

Advertisers have concluded that the most attention-grabbing word that
viewers react to is their own name. Thus a television channel in the
UK has introduced personalized advertisements with their online
streaming services.

We might enjoy hearing our name on television, but it doesn’t mean
much without the intimacy that comes when someone who loves us says
our name.

Mary Magdalene’s attention was arrested when, at the tomb where
Jesus’s body had been laid after He was crucified on the cross, He
spoke her name (John 20:16). With that single word, she turned in
recognition to the Teacher whom she loved and followed, I imagine with
a rush of disbelief and joy. The familiarity with which He spoke her
name confirmed for her beyond a doubt that the One who’d known her
perfectly was alive and not dead.

Although Mary shared a unique and special moment with Jesus, we too
are personally loved by God. Jesus told Mary that He would ascend to
His Father (v. 17), but He had also told His disciples that He would
not leave them alone (John 14:15–18). God would send the Holy Spirit
to live and dwell in His children (see Acts 2:1–13).

God’s story doesn’t change. Whether then or now, He knows those whom
He loves (see John 10:14–15). He calls us by name.

Loving Father, living Jesus, comforting Holy Spirit, thank You that
