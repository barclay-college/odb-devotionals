A Good Man

By grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of
yourselves; it is the gift of God. —
Ephesians 2:8

Today's Scripture: Romans 3:10-18

“Jerry was a good man,” the pastor said at Jerald Stevens’ memorial
service. “He loved his family. He was faithful to his wife. He served
his country in the armed services. He was an excellent dad and
grandfather. He was a great friend.”

But then the pastor went on to tell the friends and family gathered
that Jerry’s good life and good deeds were not enough to assure him a
place in heaven. And that Jerry himself would have been the first to
tell them that!

Jerry believed these words from the Bible: “All have sinned and fall
short of the glory of God” (Rom. 3:23) and “the wages of sin is death”
(6:23). Jerry’s final and eternal destination in life’s journey was
not determined by whether he lived a really good life but entirely by
Jesus dying in his place to pay sin’s penalty. He believed that each
of us must personally accept the free gift of God, which is “eternal
life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (6:23).

Jerry was a good man, but he could never be “good enough.” And neither
can we. It is only by grace that we can be saved through faith. And
that has absolutely nothing to do with our human efforts. “It is the
gift of God” (Eph. 2:8).

“Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!” (2 Cor. 9:15).

Reflect & Pray

Christ’s work for my salvation is complete! No work of mine can add to
what He’s done; I bow to worship at the Master’s feet, And honor God
the Father’s only Son. —Hess

We are not saved by good works, but by God’s work.
