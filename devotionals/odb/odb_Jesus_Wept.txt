Jesus Wept

The sting of death is sin. . . . But thanks be to God! He gives us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians 15:56-57

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 11:1-4, 38-44

I was engrossed in a book when a friend bent over to see what I was
reading. Almost immediately, she recoiled and looked at me aghast.
“What a gloomy title!” she said. I was reading “The Glass Coffin” in
Grimm’s Fairy Tales, and the word coffin disturbed her. Most of us
don’t like to be reminded of our mortality. But the reality is that
out of 1,000 people, 1,000 people will die.

Death always elicits a deep emotional response. It was at the funeral
of one of His dear friends that Jesus displayed strong emotions. When
He saw Mary, whose brother had recently died, “he was deeply moved in
spirit and troubled” (John 11:33). Another translation says, “a deep
anger welled up within him” (nlt).

Jesus was troubled—even angry—but at what? Possibly, He was indignant
at sin and its consequences. God didn’t make a world filled with
sickness, suffering, and death. But sin entered the world and marred
God’s beautiful plan.

The Lord comes alongside us in our grief, weeping with us in our
sorrow (v. 35). But more than that, Christ defeated sin and death by
dying in our place and rising from the dead (1 Cor. 15:56-57).

Jesus promises, “The one who believes in me will live, even though
they die” (John 11:25). As believers we enjoy fellowship with our
Savior now, and we look forward to an eternity with Him where there
will be no more tears, pain, sickness, or death.
