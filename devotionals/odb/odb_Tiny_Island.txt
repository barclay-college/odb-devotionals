Tiny Island

Speak evil of no one, . . . be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility
to all men. —
Titus 3:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Titus 3:1-7

Singapore is a tiny island. It’s so small that one can hardly spot it
on the world map. (Try it, if you don’t already know where Singapore
is.) Because it is densely populated, consideration of others is
especially important. A man wrote to his fiancée who was coming to
Singapore for the first time: “Space is limited. Therefore . . . you
must always have that sense of space around you. You should always
step aside to ensure you are not blocking anyone. The key is to be
considerate.”

The apostle Paul wrote to Titus, a young pastor: “Remind the people
. . . to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good, to slander
no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle
toward everyone” (Titus 3:1-2 niv). It has been said, “Our lives may
be the only Bible some people read.” The world knows that Christians
are supposed to be different. If we are cantankerous, self-absorbed,
and rude, what will others think about Christ and the gospel we share?

Being considerate is a good motto to live by and is possible as we
depend on the Lord. And it is one way to model Christ and demonstrate
to the world that Jesus saves and transforms lives.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help us to be gracious, kind, and considerate not only in
the church but also in our community. May the world who watches see
transformed people and believe in Your transforming power.

Your witness is only as strong as your character.
