Rock Of Refuge

The Lord has been my defense, and my God the rock of my refuge. —
Psalm 94:22

Today's Scripture: Psalm 94:3-23

One year during my vacation, I walked along the shoreline of a large
lake. As I approached a pile of boulders, I noticed a small alcove
between the rocks and observed that a tiny plant had taken root there.
The plant appeared to be absorbing the right amount of sunlight and
water, and it was also getting something else: protection. No downpour
or windstorm would ruffle its tender leaves.

The plant’s secure habitat reminded me of these familiar hymn lyrics:
“Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee.” Those words
express what many of us want when we encounter people with evil
intentions—people characterized by pride, cruelty, and a lack of
regard for God (Ps. 94:4-7). When we are the target of someone’s
wrongdoing, we can remember the testimony of the psalmist: “The Lord
has been my defense, and my God the rock of my refuge” (v.22).

As our rock, God is dependable and strong. As our refuge, He can
provide safety until problems pass. The psalmist reminds us: “Under
His wings you shall take refuge” (Ps. 91:4). With God as our defender,
we don’t have to fear what others will do. We can trust that God will
support us when trouble comes.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, God, for Your stable and unchanging nature. Help us to hide
ourselves in You when trouble comes our way. Remind us that we don’t
have to fight our own battles.

Refuge can be found in the Rock of Ages.
