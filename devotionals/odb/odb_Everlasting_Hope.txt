Everlasting Hope

Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the
Lord their God.
Psalm 146:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 146

The week before Christmas, two months after my mom died, holiday
shopping and decorating sat at the bottom of my priority list. I
resisted my husband’s attempts to comfort me as I grieved the loss of
our family’s faith-filled matriarch. I sulked as our son, Xavier,
stretched and stapled strands of Christmas lights onto the inside
walls of our home. Without a word, he plugged in the cord before he
and his dad left for work.

As the colorful bulbs blinked, God gently drew me out of my darkness.
No matter how painful the circumstances, my hope remained secure in
the light of God’s truth, which always reveals His unchanging
character.

Psalm 146 affirms what God reminded me on that difficult morning: My
endless “hope is in the Lord ,” my helper, my mighty and merciful God
(v. 5). As Creator of all, He “remains faithful forever” (v. 6). He
“upholds the cause of the oppressed,” protecting us and providing for
us (v. 7). “The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down” (v. 8). He
“watches over” us, “sustains” us, and will always be King (vv. 9–10).

Sometimes, when Christmas rolls around, our days will overflow with
joyful moments. Sometimes, we’ll face loss, experience hurt, or feel
alone. But at all times, God promises to be our light in the darkness,
offering us tangible help and everlasting hope.
