Learn The Cost

You were bought at a price. —
1 Corinthians 6:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 1:17-21

We gave our 2-year-old son a pair of new boots recently. He was so
happy that he didn’t take them off until it was bedtime. But the next
day he forgot all about the boots and put on his old sneakers. My
husband said, “I wish he knew how much things cost.”

The boots were expensive, but a young child doesn’t know about working
hours, salaries, and taxes. A child receives the gifts with open arms,
but we know that he can’t be expected to fully appreciate the
sacrifices his parents make to give him new things.

Sometimes I behave like a child. With open arms I receive God’s gifts
through His many mercies, but am I thankful? Do I consider the price
that was paid so I can live a full life?

The cost was expensive—more than “corruptible things, like silver or
gold.” As we read in 1 Peter, it required “the precious blood of
Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot” (1:18-19).
Jesus gave His life, a high price to pay, to make us part of His
family. And God raised Him from the dead (v.21).

When we understand the cost of our salvation, we learn to be truly
thankful.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to understand, to take in what it meant for You, the
Holy One, to bear my sin. Remind me to give You thanks for salvation
and for all the ways You show me Your love throughout my day today.

Salvation is infinitely costly, but absolutely free.
