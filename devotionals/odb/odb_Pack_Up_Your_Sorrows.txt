Pack Up Your Sorrows

Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. —
Isaiah 53:4

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 53:1-6

During the turbulent years of the 1960s, popular music in America was
a strange mixture of protest and patriotism. Some songs lashed out
against war, greed, and injustice in society, while others affirmed
duty to country and traditional values. But “Pack Up Your Sorrows,”
written by Richard Farina and Pauline Baez Marden, seemed to fit all
of the categories with its focus on the quest for personal peace. The
refrain said the following:

Well, if somehow you could pack up your sorrows, And give them all to
me You would lose them, I know how to use them, Give them all to me.

Perhaps everyone hoped that someone really could bring them peace.

The good news is that there is Someone who can! Isaiah 53 is a
prophetic picture of Israel’s promised Messiah. Christians see its
fulfillment in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. “Surely He
has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows . . . . He was wounded
for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the
chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are
healed” (vv.4-5).

Jesus took our sins and sorrows on Himself so that we could be
forgiven and have peace with God. Will you give Him your sorrows
today?
