Hold My Hand

Do not fear nor be dismayed. —
Deuteronomy 31:8

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 31:1-8

The waves of Lake Michigan were high and splashing onto the pier one
day as I followed a young family out to a lighthouse. I overheard the
young girl say to her father: “Daddy, please walk alongside me and
hold my hand at this scary part.”

Sometimes life can be scary for us too: Loss of loved ones. Financial
woes. Health problems. As we carry these heavy burdens and cares, we
long for a strong hand to hold ours to keep us steady and secure.

When Joshua took over the leadership of Israel, Moses reminded him of
God’s help in tough times. In the difficult days to come, Joshua would
need to remember to trust God and His promises. Moses said, “The Lord,
He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not
leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed” (Deut. 31:8).

Isaiah 41:13 encourages us with these words from God: “I, the Lord
your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not, I will
help you.’ ” When life gets scary, God is with us, we can hold His
strong hand.

This song by Lowell Alexander reminds us of God’s presence: “You will
face mountains so steep, deserts so long, and valleys so deep.
Sometimes the journey’s gentle, sometimes the cold winds blow. But I
want you to remember, I want you to know you will never walk alone. .
. . Jesus will be right beside you all the way.” (© 2004 Lowell
Alexander). He’ll walk alongside us and hold our hand at the “scary”
parts.
