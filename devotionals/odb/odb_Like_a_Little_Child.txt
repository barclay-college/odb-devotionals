Like a Little Child

Unless you change and become like little children, you will never
enter the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew 18:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 18:1–5; 19:13–14

One evening many years ago, after saying a goodnight prayer with our
two-year-old daughter, my wife was surprised by a question. “Mommy,
where is Jesus?”

Luann replied, “Jesus is in heaven and He’s everywhere, right here
with us. And He can be in your heart if you ask Him to come in.”

“I want Jesus to be in my heart.”

“One of these days you can ask Him.”

“I want to ask Him to be in my heart now.”

So our little girl said, “Jesus, please come into my heart and be with
me.” And that started her faith journey with Him.

When Jesus’s disciples asked Him who was the greatest in the kingdom
of heaven, He called a little child to come and join them (Matthew
18:1–2). “Unless you change and become like little children,” Jesus
said, “you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. . . . And whoever
welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me” (vv. 3–5).

Through the eyes of Jesus we can see a trusting child as our example
of faith. And we are told to welcome all who open their hearts to Him.
“Let the little children come to me,” Jesus said, “and do not hinder
them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these” (19:14).
