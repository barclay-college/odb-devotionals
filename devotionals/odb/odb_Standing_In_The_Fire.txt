Standing In The Fire

Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
furnace. —
Daniel 3:17

Today's Scripture: Daniel 3:10-25

Wrapped in blankets in my grandparents’ pickup, I watched as fire
consumed our home. My father says I slept soundly as he carried my
brother and me and our puppies out to safety. When I woke up and saw
the huge blaze, I was already safe. I was too curious and too young to
be scared.

I remember several things from that night. Even inside the truck, the
heat was intense and the fire was mesmerizing. I remember too the fear
on the faces of everyone else, checking and re-checking to see if
loved ones were safe. Later I learned that in the chaos my father
raced into the fire to look for my grandfather, which prompted my
grandfather (who was not inside the house) to race in to get my
father. Their courage affected all who saw it that night.

I’m reminded of that fire every time I read the story of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-Nego. When challenged with the decree to bow to the
king or face execution (Dan. 3:10-12), these three bravely faced the
fire for the One they loved (vv.16-18). And the Lord stood with them
in the flames (v.25).

When life’s “flames” test us, may those who observe our choices
recognize our love for each other and for our God.

How do their lives encourage you to stand firm for God? Ask the Lord

Trials are the soil in which faith grows.
