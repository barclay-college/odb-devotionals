Better Than Planned

Giving thanks always for all things. —
Ephesians 5:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 5:15-21

Interruptions are nothing new. Rarely does a day go by as planned.

Life is filled with inconveniences. Our plans are constantly thwarted
by forces beyond our control. The list is long and ever-changing:
Sickness. Conflict. Traffic jams. Forgetfulness. Appliance
malfunctions. Rudeness. Laziness. Impatience. Incompetence.

What we cannot see, however, is the other side of inconvenience. We
think it has no purpose other than to discourage us, make life more
difficult, and thwart our plans. However, inconvenience could be God’s
way of protecting us from some unseen danger, or it could be an
opportunity to demonstrate God’s grace and forgiveness. It might be
the start of something even better than we had planned. Or it could be
a test to see how we respond to adversity. Whatever it is, even though
we may not know God’s reason, we can be assured of His motive—to make
us more like Jesus and to further His kingdom on earth.

To say that God’s followers throughout history have been
“inconvenienced” would be an understatement. But God had a purpose.
Knowing this, we can thank Him, being confident that He is giving us
an opportunity to redeem the time (Eph. 5:16,20).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, so often it’s the little things in life that get to me, and
there seem to be so many of them. Whenever I’m tempted to lose my
temper, blame someone, or just give up, help me see You.

What happens to us is not nearly as important as what God does in us
and through us.
