Helping Each Other

[God] comforts us . . . so that we can comfort those in any trouble.
2 Corinthians 1:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 1:3–7

“The body of Christ” is a mysterious phrase used more than 30 times in
the New Testament. The apostle Paul especially settled on that phrase
as an image of the church. After Jesus ascended to heaven, He turned
over His mission to flawed and bumbling men and women. He assumed the
role of head of the church, leaving the tasks of arms, legs, ears,
eyes, and voice to the erratic disciples—and to you and me.

Jesus’s decision to operate as the invisible head of a large body with
many parts means that He often relies on us to help one another cope
during times of suffering. The apostle Paul must have had something
like that in mind when he wrote these words: “[God] comforts us in all
our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the
comfort we ourselves receive from God. For just as we share abundantly
in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through
Christ” (2 Cor. 1:4–5). And all through his ministry Paul put that
principle into practice, taking up collections for famine victims,
dispatching assistants to go to troubled areas, acknowledging
believers’ gifts as gifts from God Himself.

The phrase “the body of Christ” expresses well what we are called to
do: to represent in flesh what Christ is like, especially to those in
need.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for always being faithful to comfort me when I’m
hurting. Show me who needs my encouragement today.

God’s presence brings us comfort; our presence brings others comfort.
