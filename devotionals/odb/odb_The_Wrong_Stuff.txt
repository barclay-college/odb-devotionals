The Wrong Stuff

There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must
be saved. —
Acts 4:12

Today's Scripture: John 14:1-6

It was a simple task, but I was in over my head. One of the items on
the grocery list was soy. Problem was, I didn’t know what kind of soy
my wife, Sue, had in mind when she made the list. After searching the
aisles and asking the advice of a worker who was stacking soup cans, I
grabbed a bottle of soy sauce, placed it in the cart, and went on my
way.

Only after I unloaded my bags at home did I discover that Sue didn’t
want soy sauce. She wanted soy milk for our granddaughter Eliana. I
was sincere in my search. I even asked for help and confidently pulled
my selection off the shelf. But it didn’t do me (or Eliana) any good.
I had the wrong stuff.

Sadly, some people are walking through the grocery store of life with
“heaven” on their list, but they are not getting what they need.
Despite their sincerity and the intended help of others, they grab
something that won’t get them to heaven because they find a “different
gospel” (2 Cor. 11:4).

Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to
the Father except through Me” (John 14:6). And Peter said, “There is
no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved”
(Acts 4:12). Trust Jesus. Don’t settle for the wrong gospel.
