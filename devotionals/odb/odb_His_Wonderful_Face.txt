His Wonderful Face

Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always.
1 Chronicles 16:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Chronicles 16:8–27

My four-year-old son is full of questions, and chatters constantly. I
love talking with him, but he’s developed an unfortunate habit of
talking to me even when his back is turned. I often find myself
saying, “I can’t hear you—please look at me when you’re talking.”

Sometimes I think God wants to say the same thing to us—not because He
can’t hear us, but because we can tend to talk to Him without really
“looking” at Him. We pray, but we remain caught up in our own
questions and focused on ourselves, forgetting the character of the
One we’re praying to. Like my son, we ask questions without paying
attention to the person we’re talking to.

Many of our concerns are best addressed by reminding ourselves of who
God is and what He has done. By simply refocusing, we find comfort in
what we know of His character: that He is loving, forgiving,
sovereign, graceful.

The psalmist believed we ought to seek God’s face continually (Ps.
105:4). When David appointed leaders for worship and prayer, he
encouraged the people to praise God’s character and tell stories of
His past faithfulness (1 Chron. 16:8–27).

When we turn our eyes toward the beautiful face of God, we can find
strength and comfort that sustain us even in the midst of unanswered
questions.
