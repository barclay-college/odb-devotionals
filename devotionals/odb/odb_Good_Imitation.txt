Good Imitation

You became imitators of us and of the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 1:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 1:1–10

“Today we’re going to play a game called Imitation,” our children’s
minister told the kids gathered around him for the children’s sermon.
“I’ll name something and you act out what it does. Ready? Chicken!”
The kids flapped their arms, cackled, and crowed. Next it was
elephant, then football player, and then ballerina. The last one was
Jesus. While many of the children hesitated, one six-year-old with a
big smile on his face immediately threw his arms wide open in welcome.
The congregation applauded.

How easily we forget that our calling is to be like Jesus in the
everyday situations of life. “Follow God’s example, therefore, as
dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ
loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and
sacrifice to God” (Eph. 5:1–2).

The apostle Paul commended the followers of Jesus in Thessalonica for
the outward demonstration of their faith in difficult circumstances.
“You became imitators of us and of the Lord,” Paul wrote. “And so you
became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia” (1 Thess.
1:6–7).

It is the life of Jesus in us that encourages and enables us to walk
through this world as He did—with the good news of God’s love and with
arms open wide in welcome to all.

Lord Jesus, may Your words of invitation and welcome, “Come to Me,” be

Jesus’s arms of welcome are always open.
