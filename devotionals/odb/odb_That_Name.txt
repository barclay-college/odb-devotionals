That Name

God . . . has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above
every name. —
Philippians 2:9

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:5-11

Our little granddaughter Maggie and her family were back home in
Missouri after visiting with us in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her mom
told us that for a few days after returning home, Maggie walked around
the house happily saying, “Michigan! Michigan!”

There was something about that name that attracted Maggie. Could have
been the sound of it. Could have been the enjoyable time she had. It’s
hard to tell with a 1-year-old, but the name “Michigan” had such an
impact on her that she couldn’t stop saying it.

This makes me think about another name—the name of Jesus, “the name
which is above every name” (Phil. 2:9). A song by Bill and Gloria
Gaither reminds us why we love that name so much. He is “Master” and
“Savior.” Yes, what depth of meaning there is in the names that
describe our Lord! When we mention the great name of Jesus to those
who need Him as Savior, we can remind them what He has done for us.

Jesus is our Savior. He has redeemed us by His blood, and we can give
our lives wholeheartedly to Him. Jesus. Let all heaven and
earth—including us—proclaim His glorious name!
