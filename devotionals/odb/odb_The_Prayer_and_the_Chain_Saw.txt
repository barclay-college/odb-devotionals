The Prayer and the Chain Saw

Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant.
Nehemiah 1:11

Today's Scripture: Nehemiah 1

I respect my Aunt Gladys’s intrepid spirit, even if that very spirit
concerns me sometimes. The source of my concern came in the form of
news she shared in an email: “I cut down a walnut tree yesterday.”

You must understand that my chainsaw-wielding aunt is seventy-six
years old! The tree had grown up behind her garage. When the roots
threatened to burst through the concrete, she knew it had to go. But
she did tell us, “I always pray before I tackle a job like that.”

While serving as butler to the king of Persia during the time of
Israel’s exile, Nehemiah heard news concerning the people who had
returned to Jerusalem. Some work needed to be done. “The wall of
Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire”
(Nehemiah 1:3). The broken walls left them vulnerable to attack by
enemies. Nehemiah had compassion for his people and wanted to get
involved. But prayer came first, especially since a new king had
written a letter to stop the building efforts in Jerusalem (see Ezra
4). Nehemiah prayed for his people (Nehemiah 1:5–10), and then asked
God for help before requesting permission from the king to leave (v.
11).

Is prayer your response? It’s always the best way to face any task or
trial in life.

Reflect & Pray

Father, Your Holy Spirit reminds us to pray first. Today, we commit to
doing so as Your Spirit prompts us.

Make prayer a first priority, instead of a last resort.
