Comparison Obsession

Don’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you
envious because I am generous?
Matthew 20:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 20:1–16

Thomas J. DeLong, a professor at Harvard Business School, has noted a
disturbing trend among his students and colleagues—a  “comparison
obsession.” He writes:  “More so than ever before, . . . business
executives, Wall Street analysts, lawyers, doctors, and other
professionals are obsessed with comparing their own achievements
against those of others. . . . This is bad for individuals and bad for
companies. When you define success based on external rather than
internal criteria, you diminish your satisfaction and commitment.”

Comparison obsession isn’t new. The Scriptures warn us of the dangers
of comparing ourselves to others. When we do so, we become proud and
look down on them (Luke 18:9–14). Or we become jealous and want to be
like them or have what they have (James 4:1). We fail to focus on what
God has given us to do. Jesus intimated that comparison obsession
comes from believing that God is unfair and that He doesn’t have a
right to be more generous to others than He is to us (Matt. 20:1–16).

By God’s grace we can learn to overcome comparison obsession by
focusing on the life God has given to us. As we take moments to thank
God for everyday blessings, we change our thinking and begin to
believe deep down that God is good.

Reflect & Pray

I need a better focus, Lord. Help me to keep my eyes off others and
instead on You and Your good heart for all of us.

God expresses His goodness to His children in His own way.
