Sow What?

He who sows righteousness will have a sure reward. —
Proverbs 11:18

Today's Scripture: Mark 4:1-20

On the clock tower of my alma mater is an Art Deco bas-relief
sculpture titled The Sower. The inscription beneath it is from
Galatians 6:7, “Whatsoever a man soweth.” Michigan State University
remains a leader in agricultural research, but despite many
improvements in farming techniques and crop production, this fact
remains: Seeds of corn will not produce a crop of beans.

Jesus used many farming metaphors to explain the kingdom of God. In
the parable of the sower (Mark 4), He compared the Word of God to
seeds sown in different types of soil. As the parable indicates, the
sower sows indiscriminately, knowing that some seed will fall in
places where it will not grow.

Like Jesus, we are to sow good seed in all places at all times. God is
responsible for where it lands and how it grows. The important thing
is that we sow. God does not want us to reap destruction, so He wants
us to sow what is good and right (Prov. 11:18). The apostle Paul
elaborated on the metaphor when he warned believers not to sow seeds
of corruption. Instead, we are to sow seeds that will reap eternal
life (Gal. 6:8).

The answer to the question, “Sow what?” is “Sow what you want to
reap.” To reap a good harvest in your life, start sowing seeds of
goodness.

Reflect & Pray

Sow a thought, reap an act; Sow an act, reap a habit; Sow a habit,
reap a character; Sow a character, reap a destiny. —Anon.

A buried seed brings fruit; a selfless life reaps an eternal harvest.
