The Power To Change

Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing
of your mind. —
Romans 12:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 12:1-8

Educator and best-selling author Tony Wagner is a firm believer in
“disruptive innovation” that changes the way the world thinks and
works. In his book Creating Innovators: The Making of Young People Who
Will Change the World, he says, “Innovation occurs in every aspect of
human endeavor,” and “most people can become more creative and
innovative—given the right environment and opportunities.”

Paul was a first-century innovator who traveled throughout Asia Minor
telling people how they could be transformed by faith in Jesus Christ.
To the Christians in Rome Paul wrote, “Don’t copy the behavior and
customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by
changing the way you think” (Rom. 12:2 nlt). He urged them to give
themselves fully to God (v.1). In a self-centered, greedy, and
grasping world, Paul nurtured and mentored them in how to live a
Christ-centered, giving life.

The world has changed dramatically since Paul’s time. But the longings
of people for love, forgiveness, and the power to change remain the
same. Jesus, the Great Innovator, offers all of these and invites us
to experience a new and different life in Him.

Reflect & Pray

I’m thankful for the ways You’re changing me, Lord. Help me to be open
to You and to cooperate with Your work in me. Transform me to be like
You.

God takes us as we are but never leaves us that way.
