Still Working

“Well done, good and faithful servant.” —
Matthew 25:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 25:14-21

Vivian and Don are in their mid-90s and have been married more than 70
years. Recently Vivian suffered a setback when she broke her hip. This
has been additionally difficult because for several years both Don and
Vivian have been saddened by the realization that they are no longer
strong enough to be active in the life and work of their church.

However, Vivian and Don are still hard at work for the Lord: They are
prayer warriors. While they may not always be physically present and
visible in the life of their church, they are faithful “behind the
scenes” in their service for Him.

The parable of the talents in Matthew 25 reminds us that we must use
the “talents” God has given us wisely. All of us have God-given skills
and abilities at various levels—and we must not bury, unused, what God
has given us.

It is not only in our years of strength that God will use us, but also
in our youth and age, as well as in our sickness and weakness. Vivian
and Don continue to serve by praying. And like them, we honor our
Savior by using our skills—“each according to his own ability” (v.15)
to serve Him who is worthy.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You have done so much for me. Please show me what I can do to
serve You—to honor You with the abilities You have provided. May my
life be a living sacrifice of love and action for Your honor.

God can use you at any age—if you are willing.
