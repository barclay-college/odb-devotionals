Crowns Of Honor

The soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on His head. —
John 19:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 19:1-8

The Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom are stored securely and
protected within the Tower of London under 24-hour guard. Each year,
millions visit the display area to “ooh and aah” over these ornate
treasures. The Crown Jewels symbolize the power of the kingdom, as
well as the prestige and position of those who use them.

Part of the Crown Jewels are the crowns themselves. There are three
different types: the coronation crown, which is worn when an
individual is crowned monarch; the state crown (or coronet), which is
worn for various functions; and the consort crown worn by the wife of
a reigning king. Different crowns serve different purposes.

The King of heaven, who was worthy of the greatest crown and the
highest honor, wore a very different crown. In the hours of
humiliation and suffering that Christ experienced before He was
crucified, “the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on His
head, and they put on Him a purple robe” (John 19:2). That day, the
crown, which is normally a symbol of royalty and honor, was turned
into a tool of mockery and hate. Yet our Savior willingly wore that
crown for us, bearing our sin and shame.

The One who deserved the best of all crowns took the worst for us.

Reflect & Pray

Crown Him the Lord of life: Who triumphed o’er the grave; Who rose
victorious in the strife For those He came to save. —Bridges/Thring

Without the cross, there could be no crown.
