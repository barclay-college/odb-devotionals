Time Alone With God

[Jesus] went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.
Matthew 14:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 14:13–23

It was a busy morning in the church room where I was helping. Nearly a
dozen little children were chattering and playing. There was so much
activity that the room became warm and I propped the door open. One
little boy saw this as his chance to escape so when he thought no one
was looking, he tiptoed out the door. Hot on his trail, I wasn’t
surprised that he was headed straight for his daddy’s arms.

The little boy did what we need to do when life becomes busy and
overwhelming—he slipped away to be with his father. Jesus looked for
opportunities to spend time with His heavenly Father in prayer. Some
might say this was how He coped with the demands that depleted His
human energy. According to the gospel of Matthew, Jesus was headed to
a solitary place when a crowd of people followed Him. Noticing their
needs, Jesus miraculously healed and fed them. After that, however, He
“went up on a mountainside by himself to pray” (v. 23).

Jesus repeatedly helped multitudes of people, yet He didn’t allow
Himself to become haggard and hurried. He nurtured His connection with
God through prayer. How is it with you? Will you take time alone with
God to experience His strength and fulfillment?

Reflect & Pray

Where are you finding greater fulfillment—in meeting the demands of
life or in cultivating your relationship with your Creator?

When we draw near to God our minds are refreshed and our strength is
renewed!
