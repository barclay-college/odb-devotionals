An Obstacle Inventory

Let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to
put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother’s way. —
Romans 14:13

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 6:3-10

Fault-finding is a popular pastime, and unfortunately a lot of us find
it’s easy to join the fun. Concentrating on the warts of others is a
great way to feel better about ourselves. And that’s just the problem.
Avoiding the faults that need to be fixed in our own lives not only
stunts our spiritual growth but also obstructs God’s work through us.
God’s effectiveness through our lives is enhanced or hindered by the
way we live.

It’s no wonder, then, that Paul made a concerted effort to “put no
obstacle in anyone’s way” (2 Cor. 6:3 ESV). For him there was nothing
more important than his usefulness for Christ in the lives of others.
Anything that got in the way of that was dispensable.

If you want to be authentic and useful for God, take an obstacle
inventory. Sometimes obstacles are things that in and of themselves
may be legitimate, yet in certain contexts may be inappropriate. But
sin is clearly obstructive to others. Gossip, slander, boasting,
bitterness, greed, abuse, anger, selfishness, and revenge all close
the hearts of those around us to the message of God through us.

So, replace your faults with the winsome ways of Jesus. That will
enable others to see your “no-fault” Savior more clearly.
