Back in the Battle

If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us
our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
1 John 1:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Samuel 12:26–31

As a child, she had hurled vicious words at her parents. Little did
she know that those words would be her last interaction with them.
Now, even after years of counseling, she can’t forgive herself. Guilt
and regret paralyze her.

We all live with regrets—some of them quite terrible. But the Bible
shows us a way through the guilt. Let’s look at one example.

There’s no sugarcoating what King David did. It was the time “when
kings go off to war,” but “David remained in Jerusalem” (2 Samuel
11:1). Away from the battle, he stole another man’s wife and tried to
cover it up with murder (vv. 2–5, 14–15). God stopped David’s downward
plunge (12:1–13), but the king would live the rest of his life with
the knowledge of his sins.

While David was rising from the ashes, his general, Joab, was winning
the battle David should have been leading (12:26). Joab challenged
David, “Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and
capture it” (v. 28). David finally got back to his God-appointed place
as the leader of his nation and his army (v. 29).

When we permit our past to crush us, in effect we’re telling God His
grace isn’t enough. Regardless of what we’ve done, our Father extends
His complete forgiveness to us. We can find, as David did, grace
enough to get back in the battle.

Reflect & Pray

What regrets gnaw at your soul? Who in your life might be a safe
person to talk to for the reassurance of God’s grace?

Father, may we truly realize Your love defines us.
