The Fragrance of Christ

We are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ.
2 Corinthians 2:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 2:14-17

Which of the five senses brings back your memories most sharply? For
me it is definitely the sense of smell. A certain kind of sun oil
takes me instantly to a French beach. The smell of chicken mash brings
back childhood visits to my grandmother. A hint of pine says
“Christmas,” and a certain kind of aftershave reminds me of my son’s
teenage years.

Paul reminded the Corinthians that they were the aroma of Christ: “For
we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ” (2 Cor. 2:15). He may have
been referring to Roman victory parades. The Romans made sure everyone
knew they had been victorious by burning incense on altars throughout
the city. For the victors, the aroma was pleasing; for the prisoners
it meant certain slavery or death. So as believers, we are victorious
soldiers. And when the gospel of Christ is preached, it is a pleasing
fragrance to God.

As the aroma of Christ, what perfumes do Christians bring with them as
they walk into a room? It’s not something that can be bought in a
bottle or a jar. When we spend a lot of time with someone, we begin to
think and act like that person. Spending time with Jesus will help us
spread a pleasing fragrance to those around us.
