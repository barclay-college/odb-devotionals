Two Men

He groaned in the spirit and was troubled. . . . Jesus wept. —
John 11:33

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 11:30-37

Two men were killed in our city on the same day. The first, a police
officer, was shot down while trying to help a family. The other was a
homeless man who was shot while drinking with friends early that day.

The whole city grieved for the police officer. He was a fine young man
who cared for others and was loved by the neighborhood he served. A
few homeless people grieved for the friend they loved and lost.

I think the Lord grieved with them all.

When Jesus saw Mary and Martha and their friends weeping over the
death of Lazarus, “He groaned in the spirit and was troubled” (John
11:33). He loved Lazarus and his sisters. Even though He knew that He
would soon be raising Lazarus from the dead, He wept with them (v.35).
Some Bible scholars think that part of Jesus’ weeping also may have
been over death itself and the pain and sadness it causes in people’s
hearts.

Loss is a part of life. But because Jesus is “the resurrection and the
life” (v.25), those who believe in Him will one day experience an end
of all death and sorrow. In the meantime, He weeps with us over our
losses and asks us to “weep with those who weep” (Rom. 12:15).
