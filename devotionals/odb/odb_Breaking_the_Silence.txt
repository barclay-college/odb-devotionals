Breaking the Silence

He will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah . . .
to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
Luke 1:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 1:11–17

At the end of the Old Testament, God seems to be in hiding. For four
centuries, the Jews wait and wonder. God seems passive, unconcerned,
and deaf to their prayers. Only one hope remains: the ancient promise
of a Messiah. On that promise the Jews stake everything. And then
something momentous happens. The birth of a baby is announced.

You can catch the excitement just by reading the reactions of people
in Luke. Events surrounding Jesus’s birth resemble a joy-filled
musical. Characters crowd into the scene: a white-haired great uncle
(Luke 1:5–25), an astonished virgin (1:26–38), the old prophetess Anna
(2:36). Mary herself lets loose with a beautiful hymn (1:46–55). Even
Jesus’s unborn cousin kicks for joy inside his mother’s womb (1:41).

Luke takes care to make direct connections to Old Testament promises
of a Messiah. The angel Gabriel even calls John the Baptist an
“Elijah” sent to prepare the way for the Lord (1:17). Clearly,
something is brewing on planet Earth. Among the dreary, defeated
villagers in a remote corner of the Roman Empire, something good is
breaking out.

You have come to us, and we rejoice! Jesus, You are the gift of
redemption and hope for us. Thank You.
