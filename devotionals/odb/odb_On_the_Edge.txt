On the Edge

Whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.
John 8:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 6:16-23

There’s an underground lava tube south of Kuna, Idaho, that has gained
a certain amount of local notoriety. The only entrance, as far as I
know, is a yawning shaft that plunges straight down into darkness.

Some years ago I stood at the edge of that shaft and looked down. I
was drawn to venture closer and almost lost my balance. I felt a
moment of heart-pounding terror and stepped away from the opening.

Sin is like that: Curiosity can draw us toward the darkness. How often
have men and women gotten too close to the edge, lost their balance,
and fallen into the darkness? They’ve destroyed their families,
reputations, and careers through adulterous affairs that began with a
“mere” flirtation but then progressed to thoughts and actions. Looking
back they almost always say, “I never thought it would come to this.”

We think we can flirt with temptation, get very close to the edge, and
walk away, but that’s a fool’s dream. We know an action is wrong and
yet we toy with it. Then, inescapably, we are drawn into deeper and
darker perversions. Jesus put it simply: “Whoever commits sin is a
slave of sin” (John 8:34).

And so, seeing our own need for God’s help, we pray as David did in
Psalm 19:13, “Keep back Your servant also from [deliberate] sins; let
them not have dominion over me.”

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, whether we are being tempted now, or have fallen, we
thank You that You are always there, and You love us with relentless
love. We have nowhere to turn but to You.

A big fall begins with a little stumble.
