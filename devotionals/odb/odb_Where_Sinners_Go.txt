Where Sinners Go

God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still
sinners, Christ died for us. —
Romans 5:8

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:6-15

My friend was having a conversation with a man who didn’t have much
good to say about the Christian faith. My friend knew that if he were
to sound too “religious,” he would jeopardize any chance to witness.
So, in the middle of their discussion, he said, “Hey, Bob, do you know
where sinners go?”

“That’s easy,” he replied. “You’re going to tell me they go to hell.”

“No,” my friend responded. “They go to church.”

Bob was speechless. That wasn’t what he expected. He wasn’t ready to
hear from a Christian who realized he wasn’t perfect. My friend had a
chance to share that Christians understand their sinfulness and their
need for continual spiritual restoration. He was able to explain
grace—the unmerited favor we have with God despite our sinfulness
(Rom. 5:8-9; Eph. 2:8-9).

Perhaps we don’t give those outside the church a clear picture of
what’s happening inside. They may not understand that we’re there to
praise our Savior for providing “redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of sins” (Col. 1:14).

Yes, sinners go to church. And sinners—forgiven ones—go to heaven
because of God’s grace.

Reflect & Pray

We’re far from perfection, yet perfect forever, For Christ is our
righteousness, Lord, and our Savior; No justification for sin can we
offer, Yet sanctified fully, we’re now His forever. —Lee

A church is a hospital for sinners, not a club for saints.
