We’re A Community

[The Lord] gave some . . . for the equipping of the saints for the
work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. —
Ephesians 4:11-12

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 12:1-11

A pastor’s wife was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. That put the
family in a difficult, stressful situation. The pastor wondered how he
was going to be able to take good care of her while he still had
responsibilities for his church family. But he needn’t have worried
because church members stepped up and volunteered to assist him with
meals and some of her care.

The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian church about the purpose for
which the Lord gave them their spiritual gifts. Before he listed the
diversity of gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, he reminded them that “a
spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other” (v.7
nlt). God does not give His spiritual gifts for our own selfish use
but to serve others, and in so doing, we serve Him.

We are all given different gifts to be used at different times and in
different ways. But they are all to be used in love for the “edifying
of the body of Christ” (Eph. 4:12). Wherever God has placed us, we can
use what He has gifted us to do as we see the need, remembering that
we are all part of the church—the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13-14).
