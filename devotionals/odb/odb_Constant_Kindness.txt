Constant Kindness

Be kind and compassionate to one another.
Ephesians 4:32

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 141:1–4

When I was a child I was an ardent reader of L. Frank Baum’s Land of
Oz books. I recently came across Rinkitink in Oz with all the original
artwork. I laughed again at the antics of Baum’s irrepressible, good-
hearted King Rinkitink with his down-to-earth goodness. Young Prince
Inga described him best: “His heart is kind and gentle and that is far
better than being wise.”

How simple and how sensible! Yet who has not wounded the heart of
someone dear to us by a harsh word? By doing so, we disturb the peace
and quiet of the hour and we can undo much of the good we have done
toward those we love. “A small unkindness is a great offense,” said
Hannah More, an 18th-century English writer.

Here’s the good news: Anyone can become kind. We may be incapable of
preaching an inspiring sermon, fielding hard questions, or
evangelizing vast numbers, but we can all be kind.

How? Through prayer. It is the only way to soften our hearts. “Set a
guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not
let my heart be drawn to what is evil [or harsh]” (Ps. 141:3–4).

In a world in which love has grown cold, a kindness that comes from
the heart of God is one of the most helpful and healing things we can
offer to others.

Reflect & Pray

Forgive me, Lord, when I bring anger into a situation. Soften my heart
and help me use my words to encourage others. Read words from Oswald
Chambers at utmost.org

The knowledge that God has loved me beyond all limits will compel me
to go into the world to love others in the same way. Oswald Chambers
