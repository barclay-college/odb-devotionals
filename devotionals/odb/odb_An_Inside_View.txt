An Inside View

The Lord looks at the heart.
1 Samuel 16:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Samuel 16:1-7

Retired physicist Arie van’t Riet creates works of art in an unusual
way. He arranges plants and deceased animals in various compositions
and then x-rays them. He scans the developed x-rays into a computer
and then adds color to certain parts of his pictures. His artwork
reveals the inner complexity of flowers, fish, birds, reptiles, and
monkeys.

An inside view of something is often more fascinating and more
significant than an exterior view. At first glance, Samuel thought
Eliab looked like he could be Israel’s next king (1 Sam. 16:6). But
God warned Samuel not to look at Eliab’s physical traits. He told
Samuel, “People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at
the heart” (v. 7). God chose David, instead of Eliab, to be Israel’s
next king.

When God looks at us, He is more interested in our hearts than our
height, the state of our soul than the structure of our face. He
doesn’t see us as too old, too young, too small, or too big. He zeroes
in on the things that matter—our response to His love for us and our
concern for other people (Matt. 22:37-39). Second Chronicles 6:30 says
that God alone knows the human heart. When the God who has done so
much for us looks at our heart, what does He see?

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, help me to value what You value. As I follow Your example, I
pray that You will be pleased with what You see in my heart.

The true measure of a person is what’s in the heart.
