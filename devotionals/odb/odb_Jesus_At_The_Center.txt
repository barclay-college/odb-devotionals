Jesus At The Center

Then they will look on Me whom they pierced. —
Zechariah 12:10

Today's Scripture: Zechariah 12:10-14

Have you heard of the “Christocentric Principle” of biblical
understanding? Simply put, it means that everything we know about God,
angels, Satan, human hopes, and the whole universe is best understood
when viewed in relationship to Jesus Christ. He is at the center.

Recently, I discovered that one of the less familiar Old Testament
books, Zechariah, is one of the most Christocentric. This book is a
good example because it speaks of Christ’s humanity (6:12), His
humility (9:9), His betrayal (11:12), His deity (12:8), His
crucifixion (12:10), His return (14:4), and His future reign
(14:8-21).

One especially meaningful passage is Zechariah 12:10, which says,
“Then they will look on Me whom they pierced.” The piercing refers to
Israel’s historic rejection of Jesus as Messiah— resulting in His
crucifixion. But this verse also predicts a future generation of Jews
who will accept Him as their Messiah. At the second coming of Jesus, a
remnant of Israel will recognize the crucified One and turn to Him in
faith.

This marvelous book should encourage us to look for more Christ-
centered truths—both in other parts of the Bible and in all of life.
Keep Jesus in the middle of everything. Live a Christocentric life.

Reflect & Pray

Some have read God’s holy Book But failed to see its glory; That’s
because they didn’t know It’s really Jesus’ story. —Branon

Jesus Christ is the Key that unlocks the Word of God.
