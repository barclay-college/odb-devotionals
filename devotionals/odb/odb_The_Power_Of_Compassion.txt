The Power Of Compassion

A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench.
—
Isaiah 42:3

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 42:1-9

Francis Schaeffer, author and Christian apologist, struggled to spell
words correctly because of dyslexia. At the college he attended,
spelling errors lowered the grade on all written assignments. During
his first year, a professor told Schaeffer, “This is the best
philosophy paper I’ve ever read, but it’s the worst spelling. What am
I going to do? I can’t pass you.”

Francis replied, “Sir, I could never spell. Could you please just read
what I’m saying and not worry about the spelling?”

After a long pause, the professor replied, “You know, Mr. Schaeffer, I
think we’ll do that.” His wise, compassionate response encouraged a
gifted young man who would later help many of the searching generation
during the 1960s and 70s to find their way to faith in Christ.

Isaiah said of the promised Messiah, “A bruised reed He will not
break, and smoking flax He will not quench; He will bring forth
justice for truth” (Isa. 42:3). The image is of a gentle, yet powerful
Person who sets prisoners free and encourages those who are
fainthearted and tempted to despair.

Jesus came to free us from sin, not to condemn us for our condition.
Today, He offers salvation and encouragement to all who turn to Him.

Reflect & Pray

No condemnation now I dread, I am my Lord’s and He is mine; Alive in
Him, my living Head, And clothed in righteousness divine. —Wesley

When we come to Christ in our brokenness, He makes us whole.
