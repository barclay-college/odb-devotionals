What Really Matters

In humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own
interests but each of you to the interests of others.
Philippians 2:3–4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:1–11

Two men sat down to review their business trip and its results. One
said he thought the trip had been worthwhile because some meaningful
new relationships had begun through their business contacts. The other
said, “Relationships are fine, but selling is what matters most.”
Obviously they had very different agendas.

It is all too easy—whether in business, family, or church—to view
others from the perspective of how they can benefit us. We value them
for what we can get from them, rather than focusing on how we can
serve them in Jesus’s name. In his letter to the Philippians, Paul
wrote, “Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in
humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own
interests but each of you to the interests of the others” (Phil.
2:3–4).

People are not to be used for our own benefit. Because they are loved
by God and we are loved by Him, we love one another. His love is the
greatest love of all.

Reflect & Pray

Teach me, Lord, to see people as You do—bearing Your image,
being worthy of Your love, and needing Your care. May Your great love
find in my heart a vessel through which that love can be displayed.

Joy comes from putting another’s needs ahead of our own.
