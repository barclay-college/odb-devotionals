Free Tomatoes

Everyone whose spirit was willing . . . brought the Lord’s offering
for the work of the tabernacle. —
Exodus 35:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 35:20-29

Packing groceries into the trunk of my car, I glanced at the vehicle
next to me. Through the back window, I could see baskets full of
bright red tomatoes—shiny, plump, and better looking than any I had
seen in the store. When the car’s owner appeared seconds later, I
said, “What great looking tomatoes!” She replied, “I had a good crop
this year. Would you like some?” Surprised by her willingness to
share, I gladly accepted. She gave me several free tomatoes to take
home—they tasted as good as they looked!

We see an even greater spirit of generosity in the Israelites when
they gave to build the tabernacle of the Lord. When asked to provide
materials for the sanctuary, “everyone whose spirit was willing . . .
brought the Lord’s offering for the work of the tabernacle” (Ex.
35:21). The Israelites eagerly donated their gold jewelry, colored
thread, fine linen, silver, bronze, gemstones, and spices. Some also
gave their time and talents (vv.25-26).

If we follow the Israelites’ example and willingly donate our
resources, we please and honor God with our attitude and offerings.
The Lord, who sees and knows our thoughts and hearts, loves cheerful
givers. He Himself is the best example of generosity (John 3:16).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Jesus, You gave everything You had for my sake. Help me to give
with a willing heart so that my gifts will truly honor You.

The state of our heart is more important than the size of our gift.
