A Prayer to Point Us Home

Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he
gave the right to become children of God.
John 1:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 23:44–48

One of the first prayers I learned as a little boy was “Now I lay me
down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep . . .” It was a prayer
I learned from my parents, and I taught it to my son and daughter when
they were little. As a child, I found great comfort in placing myself
in God’s hands with those words before I fell asleep.

There’s a similar prayer neatly tucked away in the “prayer book” of
the Bible, the Psalms. Some biblical scholars suggest that the phrase
“Into your hands I commit my spirit” (Psalm 31:5) was a “bedtime”
prayer taught to children in Jesus’s day.

You may recognize that prayer as Jesus’s final cry from the cross. But
Jesus added one more word to it: Father (Luke 23:46). By praying that
word in the moments before His death, Jesus demonstrated His intimate
relationship with the Father and pointed believers toward their home
with Him (John 14:3).

Jesus died on the cross so we could live in the wonder of a
relationship with God as our heavenly Father. How comforting it is to
know that because of Jesus’s sacrificial love for us, we can rest in
God’s care as His children! We can close our eyes without fear because
our Father watches over us and has promised to wake us up to life with
Him (1 Thessalonians 4:14).

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, I receive the gift of forgiveness You offer me through the
cross. Help me to turn from my sins and follow You, all the way home.

A bright new morning awaits us in Jesus.
