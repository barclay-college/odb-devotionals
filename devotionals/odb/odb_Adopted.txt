Adopted

Put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication,
uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness. —
Colossians 3:5

Today's Scripture: Colossians 3:1-12

In ancient Rome, adoption was occasionally used by the emperors to
pass on succession to competent heirs. Augustus Caesar was adopted by
his great-uncle Julius Caesar. Other notable adoptees include the
emperors Tiberius, Trajan, and Hadrian. All of them proved to be
strong rulers because each lived like a child of his adoptive father.

Every Christian is an adopted child of the King of kings. We are
greatly indebted to Him for His favor. But God, who has everything,
does not need us to repay Him.

What does God desire? He wants us to live in a way that befits His
children. Activities and values that are not in keeping with our
position as God’s children must be done away with (Col. 3:5). Selfish
and destructive ways are to be replaced by activities and values that
showcase our gratitude and love for God and reflect our status as His
children. Paul wrote, “Put on tender mercies, kindness, humility,
meekness, longsuffering” (v.12).

Can others around you tell that you are indeed a child of the King?
Ask the Holy Spirit what you need to put off and put on in your life
so that you can reflect more truly your status as God’s adopted child.

Reflect & Pray

I once was an outcast stranger on earth, A sinner by choice and an
alien by birth; But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down— An heir
to a mansion, a robe, and a crown. —Buell

We honor God’s name when we call Him our Father and live like His
children.
