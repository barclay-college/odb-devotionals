One Who Understands

The Lord searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the
thoughts. —
1 Chronicles 28:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:7-12

My friend’s husband was in the last stages of dementia. In his first
introduction to the nurse who was assigned to care for him, he reached
out for her arm and stopped her. He said he wanted to introduce her to
his best friend—one who loved him deeply.

Since no one else was in the hall, the nurse thought he was
delusional. But as it turned out he was speaking of Jesus. She was
deeply touched but had to hurry on to care for another patient. When
she returned, the darkness had closed in again and the man was no
longer lucid.

Even though this man had descended into the darkness of dementia, he
knew that the Lord was his best Friend. God dwells in the fathomless
depth that is our soul. He can pierce the darkest mind and assure us
of His tender, loving care. Indeed, the darkness shall not hide us
from Him (Ps. 139:12).

We do not know what the future holds for us or those we love. We too
may descend into the darkness of mental illness, Alzheimer’s, or
dementia as we age. But even there the Lord’s hand will lead us and
His right hand will hold us tight (v.10). We cannot get away from His
love and personal care.

Reflect & Pray

God knows each winding way I take, And every sorrow, pain, and ache;
And me He never will forsake— He knows and loves His own. —Bosch

Jesus loves me. This I know.
