Lesson Of The Horse Mask

Turn away my eyes from looking at worthless things, and revive me in
Your way. —
Psalm 119:37

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:33-40

Not far from where my husband and I live is a farm with a lot of
horses. During certain seasons, some of the horses have masks over
their eyes. For a long time I felt sorry for the horses who weren’t
allowed to see. But then I learned that my assumption about the masks
was wrong. The masks are made of mesh, so horses can see through them.
But flies, which cause eye disease, can’t get through them. The masks
don’t keep the horses from seeing; they keep them from going blind!

Non-Christians often make conclusions about the Bible similar to the
one I made about the mask. They think of it as something God puts over
our eyes to keep us from seeing all the fun we could be having. They
feel sorry for Christians because they think the Lord keeps us from
enjoying life. What I didn’t know about the horse mask, they don’t
know about the Bible. It doesn’t keep us from seeing all that is good;
it keeps us from being infected by lies that cause spiritual
blindness. The Bible doesn’t keep us from enjoying life; it makes true
enjoyment possible.

The Bible doesn’t keep us from knowing truth; it prevents us from
believing lies.

Reflect & Pray

O send Thy Spirit, Lord, now unto me That He may touch my eyes and
make me see; Show me the truth concealed within Thy Word, And in Thy
Book revealed I see Thee, Lord. —Lathbury

When we see the world through the filter of the Word, we learn the
truth about both.
