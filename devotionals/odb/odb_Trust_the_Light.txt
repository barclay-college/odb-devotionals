Trust the Light

Believe in the light . . . so that you may become children of light.
John 12:36

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 12:25–33, 35–36

The weather forecast said bomb cyclone. That’s what happens when a
winter storm rapidly intensifies as the atmospheric pressure drops. By
the time night fell, the blizzard conditions made the highway to the
Denver airport almost impossible to see. Almost. But when it’s your
daughter who’s flying home to visit, you do what you have to do. You
pack extra clothes and water (just in case you get stranded on the
highway), drive very slowly, pray without ceasing, and last but not
least, trust your headlights. And sometimes you can achieve the almost
impossible.

Jesus foretold of a storm on the horizon, one that would involve His
death (John 12:31–33), and one that would challenge His followers to
stay faithful and serve (v. 26). It was going to get dark and be
almost impossible to see. Almost. So what did Jesus tell them to do?
Believe, or trust, the Light (v. 36). That was the only way they could
keep going forward and stay faithful.

Jesus would only be with them a little while longer. But believers
have His Spirit as our constant guide to light the way. We too will
face dark times when it’s almost impossible to see the way ahead.
Almost. But by believing, or trusting in the Light, we can press on.

Reflect & Pray

What dark season have you been through lately? How did Jesus, the
Light, help you keep going?

Jesus, thank You for being the light in my darkness. Help me to trust
and keep going.
