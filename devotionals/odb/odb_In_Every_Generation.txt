In Every Generation

The Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures to
all generations. —
Psalm 100:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 100

It may seem surprising when children don’t follow their parents’
example of faith in God. Equally unexpected is a person with a deep
commitment to Christ who emerges from a family where faith was not
present. In every generation, each person has a choice.

Samuel was a great man of God who appointed his two sons, Joel and
Abijah, as leaders over Israel (1 Sam. 8:1-2). Unlike their father,
however, they were corrupt and “turned aside after dishonest gain,
took bribes, and perverted justice” (v.3). Yet, years later, we find
Heman, Joel’s son, appointed as a musician in the house of the Lord
(1 Chron. 6:31-33). Heman, Samuel’s grandson—along with Asaph, his
right-hand man and the author of many of the psalms—served the Lord by
singing joyful songs (15:16-17).

Even though a person seems indifferent toward the faith so precious to
his or her parents, God is still at work. Things can change in later
years, and seeds of faith may spring to life in generations to come.

No matter what the family situation may be, we know that “the Lord is
good; His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures to all
generations.”

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me to remember that You are the one who causes the
seed of faith to grow. We give our loved ones into Your care, knowing
that the end of the story has not yet been written.

God’s faithfulness extends to all generations.
