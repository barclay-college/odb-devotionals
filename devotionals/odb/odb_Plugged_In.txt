Plugged In

He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He
increases strength. —
Isaiah 40:29

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 40:27-31

My wife was working at home on her computer recently when she suddenly
noticed her laptop battery power was low and the computer was about to
shut down. The computer was plugged in, though, so it shouldn’t have
been using the battery. Following the laptop cord to the extension
cord, she finally noticed that the extension cord was actually plugged
back into itself instead of the wall outlet! She looked at me, amused,
and said, “There’s a devotional in there somewhere.”

As she said it, I was reminded of a passage of Scripture on the power
of God: Isaiah 40:27-31. Isaiah identifies the true and unending
Source of strength from which we must draw ours—“the everlasting God,
the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth” (v.28). Then he speaks
to those whose strength is ebbing, encouraging them to wait on the
Lord to find their strength renewed (vv.29-31).

Jesus spoke of us as branches abiding in Him as the Vine (John
15:4-5). It’s a parallel to Isaiah’s powerful closing, which promises
that if we’re plugged into God we will “run and not be weary, . . .
walk and not faint” (Isa. 40:31).

When we find ourselves weary and distressed, we need to plug into the
true Source of strength and life.
