Zebras and Wildebeests

There should be no schism in the body, but . . . the members should
have the same care for one another. —
1 Corinthians 12:25

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 12:14-26

After our plane landed on the gravel airstrip, Jay and I climbed out
and entered the world of Masai Mara in Kenya. A Masai tribesman named
Sammy met us and loaded our baggage into a Land Rover. Then we headed
toward the camp where we would spend the next 2 days.

Stopping so we could watch the zebras and wildebeests migrating from
Masai Mara to Serengeti, Sammy explained that the two massive herds
travel together because the zebras have good eyesight but a poor sense
of smell, and the wildebeests have bad eyesight but a good sense of
smell. By traveling together, both are less vulnerable to predators.
This was our first lesson from God’s revelation in creation, which
Kenya has in abundance.

Just as God makes animals with different strengths and weaknesses, He
makes people the same way. God made us to be dependent not only on Him
but also on one another. The apostle Paul elaborated on this idea in
his letter to the church in Corinth. As members of the body of Christ,
we all have different gifts and abilities (1 Cor. 12:12-31).

The church is healthy only when we work together, look out for each
other, and use our strengths to benefit one another.
