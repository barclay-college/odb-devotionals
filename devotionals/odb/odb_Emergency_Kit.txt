Emergency Kit

Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. —
Ephesians 6:13

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 6:10-18

For a dozen years, I took an auto emergency kit on every long driving
trip but never had to use it. It became such a familiar item that on
the night we really needed it, I forgot it was there. But fortunately
my wife remembered.

After hitting a deer on a dark rural highway, our van was completely
disabled. While I fumbled with a small flashlight to assess the damage
and call a tow truck, my wife opened the emergency kit, set out a
reflective warning marker, then turned on the bright flashlight, much
to my surprise. Later we talked about how a crisis can cause us to
forget the resources we have, just when we need them most.

Paul urged the Ephesians to “put on the whole armor of God, that you
may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil” (Eph. 6:11). This
protective covering includes truth, righteousness, readiness, faith,
salvation, and prayer (vv.14-18). Although these spiritual resources
guard us each day, we need to remember them when disaster strikes and
the enemy tries to undermine our confidence in God’s love and care.

Use the kit. “Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand” (v.13).

Reflect & Pray

When Satan launches his attack, We must take heart and pray; If we
submit ourselves to God, He’ll be our strength and stay. —Sper

God provides the armor, but we must put it on.
