Tears and Laughter

No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound
of weeping.
Ezra 3:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ezra 3:7–13

Last year at a retreat I reconnected with some friends I hadn’t seen
in a long time. I laughed with them as we enjoyed the reunion, but I
also cried because I knew how much I had missed them.

On the last day of our time together we celebrated the Lord’s Supper.
More smiles and tears! I rejoiced over the grace of God, who had given
me eternal life and these beautiful days with my friends. But again I
cried as I was sobered by what it had cost Jesus to deliver me from my
sin.

I thought about Ezra and that wonderful day in Jerusalem. The exiles
had returned from captivity and had just completed rebuilding the
foundation of the Lord’s temple. The people sang for joy, but some of
the older priests cried (Ezra 3:10–12). They were likely remembering
Solomon’s temple and its former glory. Or were they grieving over
their sins that had led to the captivity in the first place?

Sometimes when we see God at work we experience a wide range of
emotions, including joy when we see God’s wonders and sorrow as we
remember our sins and the need for His sacrifice.

The Israelites were singing and weeping, the noise was heard far away
(v. 13). May our emotions be expressions of our love and worship to
our Lord, and may they touch those around us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You welcome our sorrow and our joy, our tears and our laughter.
We bring all of our emotions in their raw honesty to You. May we
praise You with our whole being.

Both tears and smiles bring God praise.
