Tell Your Story

Your awe-inspiring deeds will be on every tongue; I will proclaim Your
greatness. —
Psalm 145:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Timothy 1:12-20

Michael Dinsmore, a former prisoner and relatively new Christian, was
asked to give his testimony in a prison. After he spoke, some inmates
came to him and said, “This is the most exciting meeting we’ve ever
been to!” Michael was amazed that God could use his simple story.

In 1 Timothy, after Paul had charged Timothy to stay the course
preaching the gospel (1:1-11), he shared his personal testimony to
encourage the young man (vv.12-16). He told about God’s mercy in his
own life. Paul said that he had mocked the Lord, but He changed him.
In His mercy, God not only counted him faithful and gave him a job to
do, but He also enabled him to do His work (v.12). Paul considered
himself the worst of sinners, but God saved him (v.15).

The Lord is able! That is what Paul wanted Timothy to see, and what we
need to see too. Through Paul’s testimony, we see God’s mercy. If God
could use someone like Paul, He can use us. If God could save the
worst of sinners, then no one is beyond His reach.

Our story of God’s work in our lives can encourage others. Let those
around you know that the God of the Bible is still at work today!

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for the salvation You offer and that no one,
including me, is beyond the reach of Your mercy, grace, and
transforming power. Help me share my story with others so that people
can see Your love.

No one is beyond the reach of God’s love.
