Graceland

The grace of God . . . abounded to many. —
Romans 5:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:15-21

The Graceland Mansion in Memphis, Tennessee, is one of the most
visited homes in the US. It was built in the 1930s and named after the
original owner’s great aunt, Grace. It later became famous as the home
of Elvis Presley.

I love the name Graceland because it describes the amazing territory
into which God placed me when He forgave me of my sin and made me His
own. He took me out of the darkness and brought me into His own
“graceland.”

The apostle Paul says that “the grace of God and the gift by the grace
of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many” (Rom. 5:15). I’ll be
forever thankful that the “many” includes me and that God’s love has
transferred me into the territory of His marvelous, infinite,
matchless grace!

Think of the blessing of being in God’s graceland. It is a realm where
He has given us entrance into His presence and where that same grace
continues to overflow into our lives on a daily basis. Paul tells us
that even in times of despair God showers us with sufficient grace to
see us through (see 2 Cor. 12:9).

No matter what life may bring, nothing can remove us from the realm of
God’s grace.
