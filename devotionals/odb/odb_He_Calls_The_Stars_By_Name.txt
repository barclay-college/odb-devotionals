He Calls The Stars By Name

He counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by name. —
Psalm 147:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 147:1-9

On a plateau high above the Atacama Desert in Chile, one of the
world’s largest radio telescopes is giving astronomers a view of the
universe never seen before. In an Associated Press article, Luis
Andres Henao spoke of scientists from many countries “looking for
clues about the dawn of the cosmos—from the coldest gases and dust
where galaxies are formed and stars are born to the energy produced by
the Big Bang.”

The Bible celebrates the mighty power and infinite understanding of
God who “counts the number of the stars” and “calls them all by name”
(Ps. 147:4). Yet the Creator of the universe is not a remote, uncaring
force, but a loving heavenly Father who “heals the brokenhearted and
binds up their wounds” (v.3). “The Lord lifts up the humble” (v.6) and
“takes pleasure in those who fear Him, in those who hope in His mercy”
(v.11).

He loves us so much that “He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever
believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John
3:16).

British author J. B. Phillips called Earth “the visited planet,” where
the Prince of Glory is still working out His plan.

Our hope for today and forever lies in the loving mercy of God who
calls each star by name.

Reflect & Pray

The God who made the firmament, Who made the deepest sea, The God who
put the stars in place Is the God who cares for me. —Berg

God, who knows the name of every star, knows all our names as well.
