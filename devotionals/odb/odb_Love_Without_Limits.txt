Love Without Limits

The Lord is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.
Psalm 145:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 145:8–21

A wise friend advised me to avoid using the words “you always” or “you
never” in an argument—especially with my family. How easy it is to
criticize others around us and to feel unloving toward those we love.
But there is never any variation in God’s enduring love for us all.

Psalm 145 overflows with the word all. “The Lord is good to all; he
has compassion on all he has made” (v. 9). “The Lord is trustworthy in
all he promises and faithful in all he does. The Lord upholds all who
fall and lifts up all who are bowed down” (vv. 13–14). “The Lord
watches over all who love him” (v. 20).

A dozen times in this psalm we are reminded that God’s love is without
limit and favoritism. And the New Testament reveals that the greatest
expression of it is seen in Jesus Christ: “For God so loved the world
that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall
not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).

Psalm 145 declares that “the Lord is near to all who call on him, to
all who call on him in truth. He fulfills the desires of those who
fear him; he hears their cry and saves them” (vv. 18–19).

God’s love for us always endures, and it never fails!

Father in heaven, we are awed by Your love for us that never changes,
never fails, and never ends. We praise You for demonstrating Your
