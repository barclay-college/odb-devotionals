Walking God’s Way

Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a
voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.”
Isaiah 30:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 30:15–21

“We’re going this way,” I said as I touched my son’s shoulder and
redirected him through the crowd to follow his mom and sisters in
front of us. I’d done this more often as the day wore on at the
amusement park our family was visiting. He was getting tired and more
easily distracted. Why can’t he just follow them? I wondered.

Then it hit me: How often do I do exactly the same thing? How often do
I veer from obediently walking with God, enchanted by the temptations
to pursue what I want instead of seeking His ways?

Think of Isaiah’s words from God for Israel: “Whether you turn to the
right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying,
‘This is the way; walk in it’ ” (Isaiah 30:21). Earlier in that
chapter, God had rebuked His people for their rebelliousness. But if
they would trust His strength instead of their own ways (v. 15),
He promised to show His graciousness and compassion (v. 18).

One expression of God’s graciousness is His promise to guide us by His
Spirit. That happens as we talk to Him about our desires and ask in
prayer what He has for us. I’m thankful God patiently directs us, day-
by-day, step-by-step, as we trust Him and listen for His voice.

Reflect & Pray

Father, You’ve promised to guide us through the ups and downs and
decisions we face in life. Help us to trust and follow You, and to
actively listen for Your guiding voice.

God patiently directs us as we trust Him and listen for His voice.
