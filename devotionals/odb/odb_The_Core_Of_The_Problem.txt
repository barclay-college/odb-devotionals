The Core Of The Problem

For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for
to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not
find. —
Romans 7:18

Today's Scripture: Romans 3:10-18

One of my favorite television cartoons as a boy was Tom Terrific. When
Tom faced a challenge, he would put on his thinking cap and work
through the matter with his faithful sidekick Mighty Manfred, the
Wonder Dog. Usually, those problems found their source in Tom’s arch-
enemy, Crabby Appleton. To this day, I remember how this villain was
described on the show. He was “Crabby Appleton—rotten to the core.”

The fact is that all of us share Crabby Appleton’s primary
problem—apart from Christ, we’re all rotten to the core. The apostle
Paul described us this way: “There is none righteous, no, not one;
there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God”
(Rom. 3:10-11). None of us are capable of living up to God’s perfect
standard of holiness. Because of our condition of being separated from
a holy God, He sent His Son Jesus to give Himself to die on the cross
for the punishment we deserve, and then rise again. Now we can be
“justified freely by His grace” through faith in Him (v.24).

Jesus Christ has come to people “rotten to the core,” and makes us “a
new creation” by faith in Him (2 Cor. 5:17). In His goodness, He has
fixed our problem completely—all the way down to our core.

Reflect & Pray

I know I’m a sinner and Christ is my need; His death is my ransom, no
merit I plead. His work is sufficient, on Him I believe; I have life
eternal when Him I receive. —Anon.

We need more than a new start— we need a new heart.
