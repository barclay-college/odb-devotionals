Repair or Replace?

If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
2 Corinthians 5:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 5:14-21

It was time to fix the trim on the windows of our house. So I scraped,
sanded, and applied wood filler to get the aging trim ready for paint.
After all of my efforts—including a coat of primer and some too-
expensive paint—the trim looks, well, pretty good. But it doesn’t look
new. The only way to make the trim look new would be to replace the
old wood.

It’s okay to have weather-damaged window trim that looks “pretty good”
to our eye. But when it comes to our sin-damaged hearts, it’s not
enough to try to fix things up. From God’s point of view, we need all
things to become new (2 Cor. 5:17).

That is the beauty of salvation through faith in Jesus. He died on the
cross as a sacrifice for our sin and rose from the dead to display His
power over sin and death. The result is that in God’s eyes, faith in
Christ’s work makes us a “new creation” (2 Cor. 5:17) and replaces the
old with a “new life” (Acts 5:20). Looking through Jesus and His work
on the cross for us, our heavenly Father sees everyone who has put his
or her faith in Him as new and unblemished.

Sin has caused great damage. We can’t fix it ourselves. We must trust
Jesus as Savior and let Him give us a brand-new life.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, I understand that sin has damaged my heart. I put my
trust in the Savior’s sacrifice and ask You to wash away my sins and
make me a new person. Thank You for what Jesus did for me.

Only Jesus can give you a new life.
