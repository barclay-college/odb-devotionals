Your Safe Place

The name of the Lord is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and
are safe.
Proverbs 18:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 18:10–11

My daughter and I were arranging to attend an extended family
gathering. Because she was nervous about the trip, I offered to drive.
“Okay. But I feel safer in my car. Can you drive it?” she asked. I
assumed she preferred her more spacious vehicle to my compact one so I
responded, “Is my car too cramped?” “No, it’s just that my car is my
safe place. Somehow I feel protected there.”

Her comment challenged me to consider my own personal “safe place.”
Immediately I thought of Proverbs 18:10, “The name of the Lord is a
fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.” In Old
Testament times, the walls and watchtower of a city provided warning
of danger from without and shielding for its citizens within. The
writer’s point is that God’s name, which stands for His character,
person, and everything that He is, provides true protection for His
people.

Certain physical places promise longed-for safety in moments that seem
dangerous. A sturdy roof overhead in the midst of a storm. A hospital
offering medical care. The embrace of a loved one.

What is your “safe place”? Wherever we seek safety, it is God’s
presence with us in that place that provides the strength and
protection we really need.
