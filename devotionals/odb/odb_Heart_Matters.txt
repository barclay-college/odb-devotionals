Heart Matters

Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of
life. —
Proverbs 4:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 4:20-27

Our hearts pump at a rate of 70-75 beats per minute. Though weighing
only 11 ounces on average, a healthy heart pumps 2,000 gallons of
blood through 60,000 miles of blood vessels each day. Every day, the
heart creates enough energy to drive a truck 20 miles. In a lifetime,
that is equivalent to driving to the moon and back. A healthy heart
can do amazing things. Conversely, if our heart malfunctions, our
whole body shuts down.

The same could be said of our “spiritual heart.” In Scripture, the
word heart represents the center of our emotions, thinking, and
reasoning. It is the “command center” of our life.

So when we read, “Keep your heart with all diligence” (Prov. 4:23), it
makes a lot of sense. But it’s difficult advice to keep. Life will
always make demands upon our time and energy that cry out for
immediate attention. By comparison, taking time to hear God’s Word and
to do what it says may not shout quite so loudly. We may not notice
the consequences of neglect right away, but over time it may give way
to a spiritual heart attack.

I’m thankful God has given us His Word. We need His help not to
neglect it, but to use it to align our hearts with His every day.
