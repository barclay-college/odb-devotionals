Triumphing Over Giants

The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw
of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine. —
1 Samuel 17:37

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 17:33-50

In 1935, the debate team of Wiley College, a small and unranked black
school in Texas, unexpectedly defeated the all-white championship team
from the University of Southern California. This was a classic case of
the unknown triumphing over a national giant.

When ancient Israel was in peril at the hands of the Philistines,
there was a boy named David who actually triumphed over a giant (1
Sam. 17). The armies were drawn up on opposite sides of the Valley of
Elah. They were probably afraid of one another and decided that the
outcome of the battle should be determined by a battle of champions.
The Philistines offered Goliath, a giant (about 9’9″), but Israel
could not find anyone who was worthy or brave enough to fight. David
heard of the dilemma and appealed to Saul to let him fight Goliath
(vv.32-37). Saul was reluctant, but he agreed. David, armed with five
smooth stones (v.40) and unswerving faith in the Almighty God (v.45),
triumphed over the Philistines’ national champion.

We all face giants in our lives—worry, doubt, fear, sin, and guilt.
But with limited and unlikely resources and unswerving confidence in
our all-powerful God, we too can triumph over them.

Reflect & Pray

Come, Lord, and give me courage— Thy conquering Spirit give; Make me
an overcomer In power within me live. —Anon.

God gives us courage to challenge our giants.
