A Fragrance and a Letter

We are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ.
2 Corinthians 2:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 2:14–3:3

Every time I get close to a rosebush or a bouquet of flowers, I’m
unable to resist the temptation to pull a flower toward my nose to
savor the fragrance. The sweet aroma lifts up my heart and triggers
good feelings within me.

Writing to the Christians in Corinth centuries ago, the apostle Paul
says that because we belong to Christ, God “uses us to spread the
aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere” (2 Cor. 2:14). Through His
strength we can live a victorious life, exchanging our selfishness for
His love and kindness and proclaiming the goodness of His salvation.
When we do this, we are indeed a sweet fragrance to God.

Paul then switches to a second image, describing Christians as a
“letter from Christ” (3:3). The letter of our lives is not written
with ordinary ink, but by the Spirit of God. God changes us by writing
His Word on our hearts for others to read.

Both word pictures encourage us to allow the beauty of Christ to be
seen in us so we can point people to Him. He is the One who, as Paul
wrote in Ephesians 5:2, “loved us and gave himself up for us as a
fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.”

Reflect & Pray

Lord, let Your splendor fill my life, that I may draw people to You.
Help me walk in the way that spreads the fragrance of Your love to
others.

Our actions speak louder than our words.
