Space Music

Who laid [earth’s] cornerstone, when the morning stars sang together,
and all the sons of God shouted for joy? —
Job 38:6-7

Today's Scripture: Job 38:1-7

One of NASA’s observatories has discovered a giant black hole that
hums. Located in the Perseus cluster of galaxies about 250 million
light years from Earth, the black hole vibrates at the frequency of a
B flat. But it is too low a pitch to be picked up by the human ear.
Scientific instruments have placed the note at 57 octaves below middle
C on a piano.

The idea of music and heavenly bodies is not new. In fact, when God
revealed Himself to Job, He asked: “Where were you when I laid the
foundations of the earth? . . . When the morning stars sang together,
and all the sons of God shouted for joy?” (Job 38:4,7). We are told
that at the creation of our marvelous universe, songs of praise and
shouts of joy resounded to God’s glory.

A wonderful hymn by St. Francis of Assisi captures the awe and worship
we feel when beholding the radiant sun by day or the star-studded sky
at night.

All creatures of our God and King, Lift up your voice and with us sing
Alleluia, Alleluia! Thou burning sun with golden beam, Thou silver
moon with softer gleam: O praise Him, O praise Him! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! (trans. by William H. Draper. © 1968

“The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His
handiwork” (Ps. 19:1).

Let’s praise the One who made such beauty for us to enjoy!
