For This I Have Jesus

I will never leave you nor forsake you. —
Hebrews 13:5

Today's Scripture: Psalm 66:1-15

In an evangelistic meeting in Ireland, the speaker was explaining what
it means to abide in Christ and to trust Him completely in every
trial. Concluding his message, he repeated several times, “It means
that in every circumstance you can keep on saying, ‘For this I have
Jesus.’ ”

The meeting was then opened for testimonies. One young woman said,
“Just a few minutes ago I was handed this telegram. It reads, ‘Mother
is very ill; take train home immediately.’ When I saw those words, I
knew that tonight’s message was meant just for me. My heart looked up
and said, ‘For this I have Jesus.’ Instantly a peace and strength
flooded my soul.”

Three or four weeks later the evangelist received a letter from this
woman. It read, “Thank you again for the message you gave that day.
Life has become an uninterrupted psalm of victory, for I have come to
realize that no matter what life brings, for this I have Jesus.”

That believer in Christ had found in her Savior the One who would be
with her “through fire and through water,” and who would bring her
“out to rich fulfillment” (Ps. 66:12).

If you are enduring a great trial of affliction, remember—for this you
have Jesus!

Reflect & Pray

I’ve found a refuge from life’s care in Jesus, I am hiding in His love
divine; He fully understands my soul’s deep longing, And He whispers
softly, “Thou art Mine.” —Christiansen

If every circumstance finds us abiding in Christ, we will find Christ
abiding with us in every circumstance.
