Hard Mysteries

The Lord is slow to anger but great in power.
Nahum 1:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Nahum 1:1–7

As my friend and I went for a walk, we talked about our love for the
Bible. She surprised me when she said, “Oh, but I don’t like the Old
Testament much. All of that hard stuff and vengeance—give me Jesus!”

We might resonate with her words when we read a book like Nahum,
perhaps recoiling at a statement such as, “The Lord takes vengeance
and is filled with wrath” (Nahum 1:2). And yet the next verse fills us
with hope: “The Lord is slow to anger but great in power” (v. 3).

When we dig more deeply into the subject of God’s anger, we understand
that when He exercises it, He’s most often defending His people or His
name. Because of His overflowing love, He seeks justice for wrongs
committed and the redemption of those who have turned from Him. We see
this not only in the Old Testament, as He calls His people back to
Himself, but also in the New, when He sends His Son to be the
sacrifice for our sins.

We may not understand the mysteries of the character of God, but we
can trust that He not only exercises justice but is also the source of
all love. We need not fear Him, for He is “good, a refuge in times of
trouble. He cares for those who trust in him” (v. 7).

Father God, You are good. You are loving and You are merciful. Help me

God’s justice and mercy intersect at the cross.
