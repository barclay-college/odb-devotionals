Godliman Street

“Look, in this town there is a man of God.”
1 Samuel 9:6

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 9:1–10

My wife, Carolyn, and I were walking in London and came across a road
named Godliman Street. We were told that a man once lived there whose
life was so saintly that his street became known as “that godly man’s
street.” This reminded me of an Old Testament story.

Saul’s father sent his son and a servant to look for some donkeys that
had wandered away. The young men searched for many days but couldn’t
find the animals.

Saul was ready to give up and go home, but his servant pointed toward
Ramah, the prophet Samuel’s village, and replied, “Look, in this town
there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says
comes true. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to
take” (1 Sam. 9:6).

Throughout his years and into old age, Samuel had sought friendship
and fellowship with God, and his words were weighty with truth. People
knew him to be a prophet of the Lord. So Saul and his servant “set out
for the town where the man of God was” (v. 10).

Oh, that our lives would so reflect Jesus that we would leave a mark
on our neighborhoods, and that the memory of our godliness would
linger on!

I'm not sure, Lord, how my neighbors would describe me. But I want to
be close to You and to be a light in my corner of the world. Read God

The most powerful testimony is a godly life.
