Newgrange

If by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more
those who receive . . . the gift of righteousness will reign in life
through the One, Jesus Christ. —
Romans 5:17

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:12-21

Newgrange is a 5,000-year-old burial passage tomb in Ireland. Built by
the members of a farming community in Ireland’s Boyne Valley, this
magnificent structure covers more than an acre of land. It was a place
where people went to struggle with the issue of death. It is best
known for the beam of sunlight that moves through the chamber for 17
minutes each day from December 19 to 23 during the winter solstice,
the shortest days of the year. Some say it serves as a powerful symbol
of the victory of life over death.

Ever since death entered the human experience in Genesis 3, it has
been life’s one great inevitability, and many people’s chief fear. It
need not be so, however. The apostle Paul wrote, “For if by the one
man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who
receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign
in life through the One, Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:17).

From that moment in the Garden of Eden with the sin of our first
parents, sin and death reigned. Yet we need not fear death or its
consequences. Because of Christ, we can have confident hope—His
victory of life over death has given us eternal life.

Have you received Him?
