“The Lord’s”

The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s
children.
Romans 8:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 44:1–5

It doesn’t take much to notice that getting “inked” is very popular
these days. Some tattoos are so small that one barely notices them.
Others—from athletes to actors to everyday people—have opted to cover
much of their bodies with multicolored inks, words, and designs. The
trend seems like it’s here to stay, a trend that netted $3 billion in
revenue in 2014—and an additional $66 million for tattoo removal.

Regardless of how you may feel about tattoos, Isaiah 44 speaks
metaphorically about people writing something on their hands: “The L
ord ’s” (v. 5). This “self-tattoo” is the climax of an entire
paragraph that speaks of the Lord’s care for those He had chosen (v.
1). They could count on His help (v. 2); and their land and
descendants were marked for blessing (v. 3). Two simple, powerful
words, “The Lord ’s,” affirmed that God’s people knew they were His
possession and that He would take care of them.

Those who come to God through faith in Jesus Christ can confidently
say of themselves, “The L ord’s!” We are His people, His sheep, His
offspring, His inheritance, His dwelling. These are the things we
cling to in the varied seasons of life. While we may have no external
mark or tattoo, we can take heart that we have the witness of God’s
Spirit in our hearts that we belong to Him (see Romans 8:16–17).
