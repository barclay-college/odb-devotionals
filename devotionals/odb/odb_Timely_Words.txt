Timely Words

A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver. —
Proverbs 25:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 25:11-15

You may have heard the adage, “Timing is everything.” According to the
Bible, good timing applies to our words and speech too. Think of a
time when God used you to bring a timely word to refresh someone, or
when you wanted to speak, but it was wiser for you to remain silent.

The Bible says that there is an appropriate time to speak (Eccl. 3:7).
Solomon compared properly timed and well-spoken words with golden
apples in a silver setting—beautiful, valuable, and carefully crafted
(Prov. 25:11-12). Knowing the right time to speak is beneficial for
both the speaker and hearer, whether they are words of love,
encouragement, or rebuke. Keeping silent also has its place and time.
When tempted to deride, belittle, or slander a neighbor, Solomon said
that it is wise to hold our tongue, recognizing the appropriate time
for silence (11:12-13). When talkativeness or anger tempts us to sin
against God or another human being, resistance comes by being slow to
speak (10:19; James 1:19).

It’s often hard to know what to say and when to say it. The Spirit
will help us to be discerning. He will help us use the right words at
the right time and in the right manner, for the good of others and for
His honor.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, thank You for using others to speak words of
encouragement and challenge to me. Help me to be wise in how and when
my words or my silence may be helpful to someone else.

Timely words are works of art.
