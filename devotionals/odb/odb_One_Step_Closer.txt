One Step Closer

Now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. —
Romans 13:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 13:10-14

Some years ago a friend and I set out to climb Mount Whitney. At
14,505 feet, it is the tallest mountain in the contiguous United
States. We arrived at Whitney Portal late one evening, rolled out our
sleeping bags at base camp, and tried to get some sleep before we
began our ascent at first light. Whitney is not a technical climb but
rather a long, exhausting walk—11 miles of relentless ascent.

The climb, though hard-going, was exhilarating, with stunning vistas,
beautiful blue lakes, and lush meadows along the way. But the trail
grew long and exhausting, a test for legs and lungs. I thought of
turning back as the day wore on and the trail seemed to stretch
endlessly before us.

Occasionally, however, I caught a glimpse of the summit and realized
that each step was bringing me one step closer. If I just kept
walking, I would get there. That was the thought that kept me going.

Paul assures us, “Our salvation is nearer than when we first believed”
(Rom. 13:11). Every day brings us one day closer to that great day
when we shall “summit” and see our Savior’s face. That’s the thought
that can keep us going.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, may I, for the joy set before me, endure with patience the
hardship of the trail. When my journey is over, I will see You face to
face and live with You forever.

Now we see Jesus in the Bible, but someday we’ll see Him face to face.
