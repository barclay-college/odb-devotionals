Mighty Waters

His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His
voice as the sound of many waters. —
Revelation 1:15

Today's Scripture: Revelation 1:9-17

While in Brazil, I went to see Iguazu Falls, one of the greatest
waterfalls in the world. The massive falls are breathtaking, but what
impressed me most at Iguazu was not the sight of the falls or the
spray of the water. It was the sound. The sound was beyond deafening—I
felt as if I was actually inside the sound itself. It was an
overwhelming experience that reminded me how small I am by comparison.

Later, with this scene in mind, I couldn’t help but think about John
in Revelation 1:15. While on the island of Patmos, he saw a vision of
the risen Christ. The apostle described Jesus in the glory of His
resurrection, noting both His clothing and His physical qualities.
Then John described Christ’s voice “as the sound of many waters”
(v.15).

I’m not sure I fully appreciated what that meant until I visited
Iguazu and was overwhelmed by the thundering sound of the falls. As
those mighty waters reminded me of my own smallness, I better
understood why John fell at the feet of Christ as if dead (v.17).

Perhaps that description will help you grasp the awesomeness of Jesus’
presence and prompt you to follow John’s example of worshiping the
Savior.
