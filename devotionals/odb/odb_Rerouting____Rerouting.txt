Rerouting . . . Rerouting

In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths. —
Proverbs 3:6

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 3:1-8

Don’t worry. I know right where I’m going,” I said to my passengers.
Then an almost-human voice ratted me out: “Rerouting . . . rerouting.”
Now everyone knew I was lost!

These days, millions of drivers recognize those words, or others like
them, as a sign they’ve gone off track or missed a turn. The GPS
device not only recognizes when a driver is off course, but
immediately begins plotting a new path to get back on track.

Sometimes followers of Jesus need help to get back on track
spiritually. We may intentionally veer off course because we think we
know best, or drift away slowly, failing to notice we’re moving
further and further from the walk God wants with us.

God has not left us on our own, however. He has given all believers
the Holy Spirit (John 14:16-17; 1 Cor. 3:16), who convicts us of our
sin (John 16:8,13). When we’re going off course, He sounds the alarm
and triggers our conscience (Gal. 5:16-25). We may ignore the warning,
but we do so to our own detriment (Isa. 63:10; Gal. 6:8).

What comfort to know that God is at work in our lives through the
convicting work of the Holy Spirit! (Rom. 8:26-27). With God’s help
and guidance, we can continue on a path that is pleasing to Him.

Reflect & Pray

Holy Spirit, we would hear Your inner promptings, soft and clear; And
help us know Your still, small voice So we may make God’s will our
choice. —D. DeHaan

We’re never without a helper, because we have the Spirit within.
