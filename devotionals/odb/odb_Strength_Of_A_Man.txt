Strength Of A Man

Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong. —
1 Corinthians 16:13

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 16:9-13

Some years ago I found myself in an elevator with a couple of men. It
was late at night, and we all looked weary. The elevator came to a
stop, and a larger-than-life cowboy ambled in, wearing a battered hat,
an old, stained sheepskin coat, and rundown logger boots. He looked us
up and down, met our eyes, and growled, “Good evening, men.” All of us
straightened up and squared our shoulders. We were trying to live up
to the name.

On this day, which is given over to honoring guys, let’s talk about
living up to the name man. We try to be strong and macho, but often
it’s just a façade. For all our effort, we realize we don’t measure
up. Underneath the bravado we harbor a host of fears, insecurities,
and shortcomings. Much of our manliness is pure bluff.

Paul was man enough to admit it: “We also are weak,” he said (2 Cor.
13:4). That’s not pious chatter; it’s a humbling fact. Yet in what
seems to be a contradiction, Paul insisted that we are to be “men of
courage” (1 Cor. 16:13 niv).

How can we be the strong person that God meant for us to be? Only by
putting ourselves in God’s hands and asking Him to make us that way
through His power and enablement.

Reflect & Pray

Come, Lord, and give me courage, Thy conquering Spirit give; Make me
an overcomer— In power within me live. —Anon.

True strength is the power of God in the soul.
