Surrounded By Mercy

He who trusts in the Lord, mercy shall surround him. —
Psalm 32:10

Today's Scripture: Psalm 32

It was almost impossible not to see the giant billboard with the red
background and huge white letters that shouted: “This year thousands
of men will die from stubbornness.” Later I learned that the billboard
was one of hundreds just like it targeted at middle-aged men who
typically avoid routine medical screenings and often die from
preventable conditions.

Psalm 32 deals with the spiritual disease of sin, which can be treated
by honest acknowledgment and repentance. The first five verses express
the anguish of hiding our guilt and then celebrate the joyful release
of confessing our transgressions to God and being forgiven.

This psalm goes on to show that the Lord longs for us to seek His help
in difficulty (vv.6-8) and receive His guidance. “I will instruct you
and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye”
(v.8). We are hindered, though, when we stubbornly refuse to follow
His direction and repent from our sin.

God’s Word urges us, “Do not be like the horse or like the mule, . . .
which must be harnessed with bit and bridle, else they will not come
near you” (v.9). Rather than hold on to our sin, the Lord offers an
alternative: When we humbly confess, His mercy shall surround us
(v.10).

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, help us now At Thy feet to humbly bow; Take away all
thought of sin, Make us clean and pure within. —Bartels

The first step to receiving God’s forgiveness is to admit that we need
it.
