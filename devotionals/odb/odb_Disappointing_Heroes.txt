Disappointing Heroes

Think carefully about this Jesus whom we declare to be God’s messenger
and High Priest. —
Hebrews 3:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 3:1-6

A recent book that puts a fictional flavor on a slice of US history
portrays Old West gunslingers Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday as shiftless
bums. In an interview with National Public Radio, the author said of
the real Earp, “He didn’t do anything remarkable his whole life,
ever.” Through the years, in books and Hollywood movies, they’ve
become heroes. Yet reputable historical accounts show that they were
not.

In contrast, the Bible is full of flawed people who became real
heroes. But don’t lose sight of the vital source of their heroic
actions. The object of their faith was God, who chooses flawed human
beings for His remarkable purposes.

As biblical heroes go, Moses stands tall. We tend to forget that he
was a murderer and a reluctant leader who once directed a rant at God:
“Why are you treating me, your servant, so harshly?” he demanded.
“What did I do to deserve the burden of all these people? Did I give
birth to them?” (Num. 11:11-12 nlt).

How very human of Moses! And yet Hebrews reminds us: “Moses was
certainly faithful in God’s house as a servant. His work was an
illustration of the truths God would reveal later” (Heb. 3:5 nlt).

Real heroes point to the Hero who never disappoints. “Jesus deserves
far more glory than Moses” (v. 3 nlt).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for being the only Hero we can rely on without fail.
Help us not to conceal our flaws and mistakes, but to give them to
You. We trust You to use us for Your good purpose.

Looking for someone who won’t disappoint you? Look to Jesus.
