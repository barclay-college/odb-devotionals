Grace, Mercy, And Peace

Bless the Lord, . . . who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender
mercies. —
Psalm 103:1

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 1:1-10

The words grace and peace are found in all of Paul’s greetings in his
New Testament letters to the churches. And in his letters to Timothy
and Titus, he also includes mercy: “Grace, mercy, and peace from God
the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord” (2 Tim. 1:2). Let’s examine each
of these words.

Grace is what our holy God gives that we, as sinful people, don’t
deserve. In Acts 17:25, we learn that “He gives to all life, breath,
and all things.” His gifts include our very next breath. Even in our
darkest hour, strength is given by God so that we can endure.

Mercy is what God withholds that we do deserve. In Lamentations 3:22,
we read, “Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed.” Even when
we’re wayward, God gives time and help for us to turn back to Him.

Peace is what God brings to His people. Jesus said: “Peace I leave
with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to
you” (John 14:27). Even in the worst of times, we have inner
tranquillity because our God is in control.

We can be encouraged that throughout our lives the Lord will give us
the grace, mercy, and peace we need to live for Him.

Reflect & Pray

He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater, He sendeth more
strength when the labors increase; To added affliction He addeth His
mercy, To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace. —Flint

God’s grace is immeasurable, His mercy is inexhaustible, His peace is
inexpressible.
