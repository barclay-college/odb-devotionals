Idols In The Heart

Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts. —
Ezekiel 14:3

Today's Scripture: Ezekiel 14:1-8

When my husband and I first went out as missionaries, I recall being
concerned about the growth of materialism in our society. It never
crossed my mind that I myself could be materialistic. After all,
hadn’t we gone overseas with almost nothing? Weren’t we choosing to
live in a shabbily furnished, rundown apartment? I thought materialism
couldn’t touch us.

Nonetheless, feelings of discontent gradually began to take root in my
heart. Before long I was craving hungrily after nice things and
secretly feeling resentful over not having them.

Then one day God’s Spirit opened my eyes with a disturbing insight:
Materialism isn’t necessarily having things; it can also be craving
them. There I stood—guilty of materialism! God had exposed my
discontent for what it was—an idol in my heart! That day as I repented
of this subtle sin, God recaptured my heart as His rightful throne.
Needless to say, a deep contentment followed, based not on things but
on Him.

In Ezekiel’s day, God dealt thoroughly with this kind of secret
idolatry. His throne on earth has always been in the hearts of His
people. That’s why we must rid our heart of anything that destroys our
contentment with Him.

Reflect & Pray

The dearest idol I have known, Whate’er that idol be, Help me to tear
it from Thy throne And worship only Thee. —Cowper

An idol is anything that takes the place of God.
