Two Rules To Live By

On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. —
Matthew 22:40

Today's Scripture: Matthew 22:34-40

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by rules and expectations? Think of how
the Jewish people must have felt as they tried to keep up with more
than 600 rules from the Old Testament and many more that had been
imposed on them by the religious leaders of their day. And imagine
their surprise when Jesus simplified the pursuit of righteousness by
narrowing the list down to just two—“love the Lord your God” (Matt.
22:37) and “love your neighbor as yourself” (v.39).

In essence, Jesus is telling us that the way God knows we love Him is
by how we treat people. All of them. Let’s face it—loving our neighbor
can be a challenge. But when we do it to express our love to God, we
unleash a powerful motivation that loves whether the person deserves
it or not. And as we love God and our neighbor, everything else falls
into place. If I love my neighbor, I won’t bear false witness against
him, covet his wealth or his wife, or steal from him. Loving others
for God’s sake even provides the grace and strength to forgive those
who have heaped injustices upon us.

Who needs to see God’s love today through you? The more unlovable the
person, the greater the statement about how much you love God!
