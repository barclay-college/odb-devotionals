Surprised by Wisdom

Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
Romans 11:33

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 1:18–25

“It seems like the older I get, the wiser you become. Sometimes when I
talk to my son I even hear your words coming out of my mouth!”

My daughter’s candor made me laugh. I felt the same way about my
parents and frequently found myself using their words as I raised my
kids. Once I became a dad, my perspective on my parents’ wisdom
changed. What I once “wrote off” as foolishness turned out to be far
wiser than I had thought—I just couldn’t see it at first.

The Bible teaches that “the foolishness of God is wiser” than the
cleverest human wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:25). “For since in the wisdom
of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased
through the foolishness” of the message of a suffering Savior to
rescue “those who believe” (v. 21).

God always has ways of surprising us. Instead of the triumphant king
the world would expect, the Son of God came as a suffering servant and
died a humbling death by crucifixion—before He was raised in
unsurpassable glory.

In God’s wisdom, humility is valued over pride and love shows its
worth in undeserved mercy and kindness. Through the cross, our
unconquerable Messiah became the ultimate victim—in order to “save
completely” (Hebrews 7:25) all who place their faith in Him!

Reflect & Pray

When have God’s ways left you confused? How does it help to know His
ways are not our own?

Heavenly Father, I praise You for the wisdom of Your ways. Help me to
trust You and walk humbly with You today.
