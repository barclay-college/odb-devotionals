Call for Help

Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
Acts 2:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 2:14–21

After five deaths and fifty-one injuries in elevator accidents in
2016, New York City launched an ad campaign to educate people on how
to stay calm and be safe. The worst cases were people who tried to
save themselves when something went wrong. The best plan of action,
authorities say, is simply, “Ring, relax, and wait.” New York building
authorities made a commitment to respond promptly to protect people
from injury and extract them from their predicament.

In the book of Acts, Peter preached a sermon that addressed the error
of trying to save ourselves. Luke, who wrote the book, records some
remarkable events in which believers in Christ were speaking in
languages they did not know (Acts 2:1–12). Peter got up to explain to
his Jewish brothers and sisters that what they were witnessing was the
fulfillment of an ancient prophecy (Joel 2:28–32)—the outpouring of
the Spirit and a day of salvation. The blessing of the Holy Spirit was
now visibly seen in those who called on Jesus for rescue from sin and
its effects. Then Peter told them how this salvation is available for
anyone (v. 21). Our access to God comes not through keeping the Law
but through trusting Jesus as Lord and Messiah.

If we are trapped in sin, we cannot save ourselves. Our only hope for
being rescued is acknowledging and trusting Jesus as Lord and Messiah.
