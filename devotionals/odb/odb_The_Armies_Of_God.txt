The Armies Of God

He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your
ways. —
Psalm 91:11

Today's Scripture: 2 Kings 6:8-17

When our granddaughter Julia was very small, we took her on a driving
trip over an Idaho mountain road. Afterward, she and her Nana were
having a conversation about the “adventure.” “I don’t worry because I
think Papa has a guardian angel,” Nana said. “I think he must have a
team of guardian angels!” Julia replied.

The mission of angels is to protect and serve the children of God
(Heb. 1:13-14). The psalmist said, “The chariots of God are . . .
thousands of thousands; the Lord is among them” (Ps. 68:17). God is
the “Lord of hosts,” which means “armies.” The angels are the Lord’s
army.

In 2 Kings we read about Elisha and his servant who were surrounded by
the Syrian army. Elisha’s servant cried out, “Alas, my master! What
shall we do?” Elisha replied, “Do not fear, for those who are with us
are more than those who are with them.” Then the Lord opened the
servant’s eyes and he saw that “the mountain was full of horses and
chariots of fire all around” (6:15-17). The Lord’s army was at hand!

Even though we cannot see them with our natural eyes, we can rest in
the confidence that the Lord of Hosts is constantly watching over us
and He has an invisible army at His bidding to send where He pleases.

Reflect & Pray

What ready help the Father gives To struggling saints below! He sends
His heavenly ministers To thwart our ancient foe. —D. De Haan

The angels of God protect the people of God as they do the work of
God.
