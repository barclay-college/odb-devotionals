The Jaws Of Death

They departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and
healing everywhere. —
Luke 9:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 9:1-6

Lauren Kornacki is glad she took that summer CPR class, but she
probably never thought she would have to use it so soon and on someone
she loves. Her father was repairing his car when the jack slipped and
the car fell on him. Lauren, a 22-year-old, reportedly heroically
lifted the 3,300-pound car enough to pull him from underneath! Then
she kept him alive with CPR until the paramedics arrived.

Far greater than Lauren’s rescue of her father from the jaws of death
is Jesus’ rescue of us from the clutches of sin by His death and
resurrection. When Jesus sent the 12 disciples to carry out His work,
He gave them the assignment to preach the good news of God’s desire to
rescue people (Luke 9:1-6). They would not carry this out in their own
strength, but Jesus would lift the heavy burden of people’s sin as
they taught about Him. Their preaching and healing in Jesus’ power and
authority proved that Jesus had actually brought God’s rule to earth.

Many today are trapped under the weight of sin, but our great God can
rescue us from underneath those burdens and then send us into the
world to tell others that He can set them free.

Reflect & Pray

Thinking It Over Do you know someone who is trapped under the burden
of sin and needs Jesus’ rescue? In what practical ways can you be an
active agent of Jesus’ love?

Those who’ve been rescued from sin are best able to help in the rescue
of others.
