Costume Or Uniform?

Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to
fulfill its lusts. —
Romans 13:14

Today's Scripture: Romans 13:11-14

Eunice McGarrahan gave an inspiring talk on Christian discipleship in
which she said, “A costume is something you put on and pretend that
you are what you are wearing. A uniform, on the other hand, reminds
you that you are, in fact, what you wear.”

Her comment sparked memories of my first day in US Army basic training
when we were each given a box and ordered to put all our civilian
clothes in it. The box was mailed to our home address. Every day after
that, the uniform we put on reminded us that we had entered a period
of disciplined training designed to change our attitudes and actions.

“Cast off the works of darkness,” the apostle Paul told the followers
of Jesus living in Rome, “and . . . put on the armor of light” (Rom.
13:12). He followed this with the command to “put on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts”
(v.14). The goal of this “casting off” and “putting on” was a new
identity and transformed living (v.13).

When we choose to follow Christ as our Lord, He begins the process of
making us more like Him each day. It is not a matter of pretending to
be what we aren’t but of becoming more and more what we are in Christ.
