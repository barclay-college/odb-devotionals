Out Of Context

Your Word is truth. —
John 17:17

Today's Scripture: Luke 4:1-13

When a friend started making random despairing statements, people were
concerned for him and started giving advice and offering
encouragement. As it turned out, he was simply having fun by quoting
song lyrics out of context to start a conversation. Friends who tried
to help wasted their time by offering help he didn’t need and advice
he didn’t want. The consequences of my friend’s misleading statements
were not serious, but they could have been. In taking time to respond
to his false need, someone could have neglected someone else’s truly
serious need.

Some people who take words out of context just want to gain attention
or win an argument. But others are more sinister. They twist truth to
gain power over others. They endanger not only lives but also souls.

When people use words to manipulate others to behave in certain
ways—or worse, when they quote the Bible out of context to convince
others to do wrong—there’s only one defense: We need to know what God
truly says in His Word. Jesus was able to resist temptation with the
truth (Luke 4). We have the same resource. God has given us His Word
and Spirit to guide us and keep us from being deceived or misled.

Reflect & Pray

Your words of pure, eternal truth Shall yet unshaken stay, When all
that man has thought or planned Like chaff shall pass away. —Anon.

If we hold on to God’s truth, we won’t be trapped by Satan’s lies.
