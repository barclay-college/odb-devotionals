Outlasting Bitterness

If anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you,
so you also must do. —
Colossians 3:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:12-17

During the Second World War, Corrie ten Boom’s family owned a
watchmaking business in the Netherlands, and they actively worked to
protect Jewish families. Eventually, the entire ten Boom family was
sent to a concentration camp, where Corrie’s father died 10 days
later. Her sister Betsie also died in the camp. While Betsie and
Corrie were in the camp together, Betsie’s faith helped to strengthen
Corrie’s.

That faith led Corrie to forgive even the ruthless men who served as
guards during her concentration camp days. While hate and the desire
for revenge continued to destroy many lives long after the
concentration camps were gone, Corrie knew the truth: Hate hurts the
hater more than the hated, no matter how justified it may seem.

Like Corrie, we each have the opportunity to love our enemy and choose
forgiveness. Forgiveness doesn’t excuse the offense but when we
forgive we show Christ to the world. “Be kind to one another,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave
you” (Eph. 4:32).

God will help you let go of every angry grudge as you watch the Spirit
build into you a place where others see the Savior.

Reflect & Pray

The love of God within our hearts Enables us to show Forgiveness that
is undeserved So others too might know. —Sper

When we forgive someone, we look more like Jesus than at any other
moment in our life.
