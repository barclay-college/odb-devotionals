Forsaken?

Those who seek Him will praise the Lord. Let your heart live forever!

Psalm 22:26

Today's Scripture: Psalm 22:1-8,19-26

Do you know which psalm is quoted most often in the New Testament? You
may have guessed the familiar and beloved 23rd Psalm, but actually it
is Psalm 22. This psalm begins with David’s poignant, heart- breaking
words that were quoted by Jesus on the cross, “My God, My God, why
have You forsaken Me?” (Matt. 27:46; Mark 15:34).

Imagine the situation David must have found himself in that caused him
to cry out to God in this way. Notice that he felt forsaken and
abandoned: “Why are You so far from helping me?” (Ps. 22:1). He also
felt ignored: “O my God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not hear”
(v.2).

Ever been there? Have you ever looked up into the heavens and wondered
why it seemed that God had abandoned you, or was ignoring you? Welcome
to David’s world. But for every plaintive cry David expresses, there
is a characteristic of God mentioned that rescues him from
despondency. Through it all, David discovers that God is holy (v.3),
trustworthy (vv.4-5), a deliverer and rescuer (vv.8,20-21), and his
strength (v.19).

Do you feel forsaken? Seek the Lord. Rehearse His character. And “let
your heart rejoice with everlasting joy” (v.26 nlt).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, sometimes I feel as if You don’t care about my life. When those
times come, please remind me of Your character as You did David. Help
me to lean on You again and know that You are there.

Even when we don’t sense God’s presence, His loving care is all around
us.
