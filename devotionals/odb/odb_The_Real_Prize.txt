The Real Prize

Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and
gave Himself for her. —
Ephesians 5:25

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 5:22-33

I’ve been amazed at the impact that my wife, Martie, has had on the
lives of our kids. Very few roles demand the kind of unconditional,
self-sacrificing perseverance and commitment as that of motherhood. I
know for certain that my character and faith have been shaped and
molded by my mom, Corabelle. Let’s face it, where would we be without
our wives and mothers?

It reminds me of one of my favorite memories in sports history. Phil
Mickelson walked up the 18th fairway at the Masters Golf Tournament in
2010 after his final putt to clinch one of golf’s most coveted prizes
for the third time. But it wasn’t his victory leap on the green that
had an impact on me. It was when he made a beeline through the crowd
to his wife, who was battling life-threatening cancer. They embraced,
and the camera caught a tear running down Phil’s cheek as he held his
wife close for a long time.

Our wives need to experience the kind of sacrificial, selfless love
that has been shown to us by the Lover of our souls. As Paul put it,
“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and
gave Himself for her” (Eph. 5:25). Prizes come and go, but it’s the
people you love—and who love you—that matter most.

Reflect & Pray

A man who finds a godly wife Is blest beyond compare; She is his
greatest prize in life— A treasure rich and rare. —D. De Haan

Life is not about the prizes we win, but the people we love.
