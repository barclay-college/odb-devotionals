Who’s At The Center?

The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart to all
generations. —
Psalm 33:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 33:6-19

Recently, I had what for me was a “Copernican moment”: I am not at the
center of the universe. The world doesn’t revolve around me. It
doesn’t move at my pace, in my terms, nor in accord with my
preferences.

Though we might wish it to be otherwise, life is not all about us.
Everything revolves around the Lord. In Psalm 33, we read that all
nature revolves around Him and His control (vv.6-9). He assigned the
sea its boundaries and locked the ocean in vast reservoirs. Everything
in nature operates in accordance with the laws He has set.

The nations also revolve around the Lord (vv.10-12). No plan or scheme
can stand up against God’s. Ultimately, it is the Lord’s plan that
will stand forever. His intentions can never be shaken.

Finally, the lives of all humanity revolve around the Lord (vv.13-19).
God sees the whole human race. He made our hearts, and He understands
everything we do. And He has the power to intervene in our lives and
deliver us from situations spinning out of control.

Our life is created to be centered on God, not self. How thankful we
can be to serve such a powerful God, who has every aspect of our lives
under His control.

Reflect & Pray

Teach me, Lord, to live out the truth of Psalm 33. May I revere You as
I should. May I and all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of
You, for Your counsel and plans stand forever.

When we die to all about us, we live to God above us.
