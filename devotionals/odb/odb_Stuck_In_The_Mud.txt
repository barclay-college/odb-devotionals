Stuck In The Mud

He . . . brought me up out of . . . the miry clay, and set my feet
upon a rock. —
Psalm 40:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 40:1-5

We were absolutely stuck! While I was laying the wreath in place on my
parents’ grave, my husband eased the car off the road to allow another
car to pass. It had rained for weeks and the parking area was sodden.
When we were ready to leave, we discovered that the car was stuck. The
wheels spun, sinking further and further into the mud.

We weren’t going anywhere without a push, but my husband had a damaged
shoulder, and I had just come out of the hospital. We needed help! At
a distance I saw two young men, and they responded cheerfully to my
frantic waves and shouts. Thankfully, their combined strength pushed
the car back onto the roadway.

Psalm 40 recounts God’s faithfulness when David cried for help. “I
waited patiently for the Lord to help me, and he . . . heard my cry.
He lifted me out of the pit of despair, out of the mud and the mire”
(vv.1-2 nlt). Whether this psalm refers to an actual pit or to
challenging circumstances, David knew that he could always call on God
for deliverance.

God will help us too when we call on Him. Sometimes He intervenes
directly, but more often He works through other people. When we admit
our need to Him—and perhaps to others—we can count on His
faithfulness.

Reflect & Pray

I praise You, heavenly Father, that You can rescue me from any pit, no
matter how deep. Help me to accept the help of others and to be ready
to offer it to those in need.

Hope comes with help from God and others.
