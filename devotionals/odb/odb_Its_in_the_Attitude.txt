It’s in the Attitude

Consider it pure joy . . . whenever you face trials of many kinds.
James 1:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 1:1–12

Regina drove home from work discouraged and tired. The day had started
with tragic news in a text message from a friend, then spiraled
downward in meetings with co-workers who refused to work with any of
her ideas. As Regina was talking to the Lord, she thought it best to
put the stress of the day aside and made a surprise visit with flowers
to an elderly friend at a care center. Her spirits lifted as Maria
shared how good the Lord was to her. She said, “I have my own bed and
a chair, three meals a day, and help from the nurses here. And
occasionally God sends a cardinal to my window just because He knows I
love them and He loves me.”

Attitude. Perspective. As the saying goes, “Life is 10 percent what
happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it.” The people James
wrote to were scattered because of persecution, and he asked them to
consider their perspective about difficulties. He challenged them with
these words: “Consider it pure joy . . . whenever you face trials of
many kinds” (James 1:2).

We are each on our own journey of learning to trust God with hard
circumstances. The kind of joy-filled perspective James talked about
comes as we learn to see that God can use struggles to produce
maturity in our faith.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please change my attitude about hard times. Bring about joy,
perseverance, and maturity in me.

God can bring times of growth out of our times of heartache.
