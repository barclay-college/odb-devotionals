Eat and Repeat

We have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!
Numbers 11:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 16:14–18

When Kerry and Paul got married, neither one knew how to cook. But one
night Kerry decided to try her hand at spaghetti—making so much that
the couple had it for dinner again the next day. On the third day,
Paul volunteered to cook, doubling the amount of pasta and sauce,
hoping the huge pot would last through the weekend. As the couple sat
down for dinner that night, however, it was Kerry who confessed, “I’m
sick of spaghetti.”

Just imagine eating the same meal as the Israelites did—for forty
years. Each morning they gathered the sweet “super food” God supplied
and cooked it (no leftovers unless the next day was the Sabbath,
Exodus 16:23–26). Sure, they got creative—baking it, boiling it (v.
23). But, oh, how they missed the good food they had enjoyed in Egypt
(v. 3; Numbers 11:1–9), even though that nourishment had come at the
high cost of cruelty and enslavement!

We too may sometimes resent that our life isn’t what it once was. Or
perhaps the “sameness” of life has caused us to be discontent. But
Exodus 16 tells of God’s faithful provision to the Israelites, causing
them to trust and depend on His care each day.

God promises to give us everything we need. He satisfies our longings
and fills up our soul with “good things” (Psalm 107:9 esv ).

Reflect & Pray

In what ways has God provided for you in the past? What longing is
keeping you from trusting Him more?

Father, thank You for Your promise to faithfully care for me and
provide what I need.
