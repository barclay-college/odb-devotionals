Struggling With Addiction

God is faithful. —
1 Corinthians 10:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 4:14-16

Eric was struggling with an addiction, and he knew it. His friends and
family members encouraged him to stop. He agreed that it would be best
for his health and relationships, but he felt helpless. When others
told him how they had quit their bad habits, he replied, “I’m happy
for you, but I can’t seem to stop! I wish I had never been tempted in
the first place. I want God to take the desire away right now.”

Immediate deliverance may happen for some, but most face a daily
battle. While we don’t always understand why the temptation doesn’t go
away, we can turn to God on whatever path we find ourselves. And
perhaps that is the most important part of our struggle. We learn to
exchange our futile efforts to change for complete dependence on God.

Jesus was tempted also, just as we are, so He understands what we’re
feeling (Mark 1:13). He sympathizes with our struggles (Heb. 4:15),
and we can “come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain
mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (v.16). He also uses
others, including trained professionals, to lean on along the way.

Whatever battles we may be facing today, we know this—God loves us
much more than we can imagine, and He is faithful to come to our
assistance.

Reflect & Pray

For Further Thought Read Matthew 4:1-11 about how Jesus handled
temptations. Also read 1 Corinthians 10:11-13 to learn how He can help
us when we are tempted.

We are not tempted because we are evil; we are tempted because we are
human.
