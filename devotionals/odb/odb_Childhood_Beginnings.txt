Childhood Beginnings

Even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve. —
Mark 10:45

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 3:14-17

Last summer, our church invited a young man to join the staff. As
Caleb shared how he grew up in Costa Rica while his family was serving
Christ there, he reflected on the words of 2 Timothy 3:14-17. From his
childhood, he reminisced, he had known the Bible. His mother and
father had taught him the truths of the Scriptures that were “able to
make [him] wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus”
(v.15). He acknowledged that his preparation to be a pastor had begun
when he was still a child.

Our congregation had the opportunity to “meet” his family in Costa
Rica via a video-conferencing call. Caleb’s dad challenged his son
using the words of Jesus about Himself in Mark 10:45. He said, “Caleb,
remember our family motto, ‘We are here to serve, not to be served.’”
It was easy to understand how this young man had developed his
maturity of faith.

The children God has entrusted to us are precious gifts. A good
foundation will help them to develop into mature believers who are
“complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Tim. 3:17).
With God’s help we can pass on the baton of faith to future
generations. What a great privilege to be servants like Jesus.
