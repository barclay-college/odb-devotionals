A Closing Door

Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. —
2 Corinthians 6:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 5:18-6:2

Beep, beep, beep, beep. The warning sound and flashing lights alerted
commuters that the train door was about to close. Yet a few tardy
individuals still made a frenzied scramble across the platform and
onto the train. The door closed on one of them. Thankfully, it
rebounded and the passenger boarded the train safely. I wondered why
people took such risks when the next train would arrive in a mere 4
minutes.

There is a far more important door that we must enter before it
closes. It is the door of God’s mercy. The apostle Paul tells us,
“Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of
salvation” (2 Cor. 6:2). Christ has come, died for our sins, and has
risen from the grave. He has opened the way for us to be reconciled to
God and has proclaimed for us the day of salvation.

Today is that day. But one day the door of mercy will close. To those
who received and served Christ, He will say, “Come, you blessed of My
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you” (Matt. 25:34). But those
who don’t know Him will be turned away (v.46).

Our response to Jesus Christ determines our destiny. Today Jesus
invites, “I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved”
(John 10:9).

Today Thy gate is open, And all who enter in Shall find a Father’s
