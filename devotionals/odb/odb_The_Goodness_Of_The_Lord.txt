The Goodness Of The Lord

Oh, how I love Your law! —
Psalm 119:97

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:97-104

Some years ago I came across a short essay written by Sir James
Barrie, an English baron. In it he gives an intimate picture of his
mother, who deeply loved God and His Word and who literally read her
Bible to pieces. “It is mine now,” Sir James wrote, “and to me the
black threads with which she stitched it are a part of the contents.”

My mother also loved God’s Word. She read and pondered it for 60 years
or more. I keep her Bible on my bookshelf in a prominent place. It too
is tattered and torn, each stained page marked with her comments and
reflections. As a boy, I often walked into her room in the morning and
found her cradling her Bible in her lap, poring over its words. She
did so until the day she could no longer see the words on the page.
Even then her Bible was the most precious book in her possession.

When Sir James’ mother grew old, she could no longer read the words of
her Bible. Yet daily, her husband put her Bible in her hands, and she
would reverently hold it there.

The psalmist wrote, “How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter
than honey to my mouth” (119:103). Have you tasted the goodness of the
Lord? Open your Bible today.

Reflect & Pray

The Bible, the Bible! more precious than gold; Glad hopes and bright
glories its pages unfold; It speaks of the Father and tells of His
love, And shows us the way to the mansions above. —Anon.

A well-read Bible is a sign of a well-fed soul.
