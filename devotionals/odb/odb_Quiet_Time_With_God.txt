Quiet Time With God

He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the
still waters. —
Psalm 23:2

Today's Scripture: Psalm 23

The word connected captures our contemporary experience of life. Many
people rarely go anywhere without a cell phone, iPod, laptop, or
pager. We have become accessible 24 hours a day. Some psychologists
see this craving to stay connected as an addiction. Yet a growing
number of people are deliberately limiting their use of technology.
Being a “tech-no” is their way of preserving times of quiet, while
limiting the flow of information into their lives.

Many followers of Christ find that a daily time of Bible reading and
prayer is essential in their walk of faith. This “quiet time” is a
disconnection from external distractions in order to connect with God.
The “green pastures” and “still waters” of Psalm 23:2 are more than an
idyllic country scene. They speak of our communion with God whereby He
restores our souls and leads us in His paths (v.3).

All of us can make time to meet with God, but do we? In Robert
Foster’s booklet “7 Minutes With God,” he suggests a way to begin:
Start with a brief prayer for guidance, then read the Bible for a few
minutes, and close with a short time of prayer that includes
adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication for others. It’s
vital to take time today to connect with the Lord, who is our life.

Reflect & Pray

We need to set aside the time To read God’s Word and pray, And listen
for the Spirit’s voice To guide us in His way. —Sper

Time spent with God is time well spent.
