Only A Sketch

Now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in
part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. —
1 Corinthians 13:12

Today's Scripture: 1 Corthians 13:8-12

In The Weight of Glory, C. S. Lewis tells the story of a woman who
gave birth to a son while confined as a prisoner in a dungeon. Since
the boy had never seen the outside world, his mother tried to describe
it by making pencil drawings. Later when he and his mother were
released from prison, the simple pencil sketches were replaced by the
actual images of our beautiful world.

In a similar way, the inspired picture the Bible gives us of heaven
will someday be replaced by joyful, direct experience. Paul understood
that our perception of heaven is limited until one day in the future
when we will be in Christ’s presence. “Now we see in a mirror, dimly,
but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just
as I also am known” (1 Cor. 13:12). Yet Paul’s confidence in future
glory gave him strength in the midst of trial: “I consider that the
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
glory which shall be revealed in us” (Rom. 8:18).

Our current idea of the glories of heaven is only a simple sketch. But
we can be completely confident in Jesus’ claim that He has gone to
prepare a place for us (John 14:1-3). The best is yet to come!

Reflect & Pray

Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven And the glories I there shall
behold; What a joy that will be when my Savior I see In that beautiful
city of gold! —Anon.

Now we see Jesus in the Bible, but one day we’ll see Him face to face.
