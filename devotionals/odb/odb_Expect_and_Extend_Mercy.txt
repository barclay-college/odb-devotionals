Expect and Extend Mercy

God, have mercy on me, a sinner.
Luke 18:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 18:9–14

When I complained that a friend’s choices were leading her deeper into
sin and how her actions affected me, the woman I prayed with weekly
placed her hand over mine. “Let’s pray for all of us.”

I frowned. “All of us?”

“Yes,” she said. “Aren’t you the one who always says Jesus sets our
standard of holiness, so we shouldn’t compare our sins to the sins of
others?”

“That truth hurts a little,” I said, “but you’re right. My judgmental
attitude and spiritual pride are no better or worse than her sins.”

“And by talking about your friend, we’re gossiping. So—”

“We’re sinning.” I lowered my head. “Please, pray for us.”

In Luke 18, Jesus shared a parable about two men approaching the
temple to pray in very different ways (vv. 9–14). Like the Pharisee,
we can become trapped in a circle of comparing ourselves to other
people. We can boast about ourselves (vv. 11–12) and live as though we
have the right to judge and the responsibility or the power to change
others.

But when we look to Jesus as our example of holy living and encounter
His goodness firsthand, like the tax collector, our desperate need for
God’s grace is magnified (v. 13). As we experience the Lord’s loving
compassion and forgiveness personally, we’ll be forever changed and
empowered to expect and extend mercy, not condemnation, to others.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please keep us from falling into the trap of comparing ourselves
to others. Mold us and make us more like You.

When we realize the depth of our need for mercy, we can more readily
offer mercy to others.
