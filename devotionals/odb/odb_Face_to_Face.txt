Face to Face

The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend.
Exodus 33:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 33:7–14

Although the world is connected electronically like never before,
nothing beats time together in person. As we share and laugh together,
we can often sense—almost unconsciously—the other person’s emotions by
watching their facial movements. Those who love each other, whether
family or friends, like to share with each other face to face.

We see this face-to-face relationship between the Lord and Moses, the
man God chose to lead His people. Moses grew in confidence over the
years of following God, and he continued to follow Him despite the
people’s rebelliousness and idolatry. After the people worshiped a
golden calf instead of the Lord (see Ex. 32), Moses set up a tent
outside of the camp in which to meet God, while they had to watch from
a distance (33:7–11). As the pillar of cloud signifying God’s presence
descended to the tent, Moses spoke on their behalf. The Lord promised
that His Presence would go with them (v. 14).

Because of Jesus’s death on the cross and His resurrection, we no
longer need someone like Moses to speak with God for us. Instead, just
as Jesus offered to His disciples, we can have friendship with God
through Christ (John 15:15). We too can meet with Him, with the Lord
speaking to us as one speaks to a friend.

We can speak to the Lord as a friend.
