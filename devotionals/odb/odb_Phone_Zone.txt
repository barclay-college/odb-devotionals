Phone Zone

Pray continually.
1 Thessalonians 5:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:16–24

One of the benefits of cell phones is that we now have virtually
unlimited access to others. As a result, many people talk on the phone
or text even while driving—sometimes resulting in terrible car
crashes. To avoid such disasters, many areas of the world have made
distracted driving illegal. In the United States, highway signs are
popping up to remind drivers of special cell phone zones where they
can pull off the road to safely talk and text to their heart’s
delight.

While it is a good idea to restrict mobile phone communication for
drivers, there is another kind of communication that has no
restrictions: prayer. God invites us to call on Him whether we are
coming, going, or sitting still. In the New Testament, Paul’s words
advise each person who wants to communicate with God to “pray
continually” (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Paul brackets this divine open-
door policy by encouraging us to “rejoice always” (v. 16) and to “give
thanks in all circumstances” (v. 18). God calls us to joy and
thanksgiving—expressions of faith in God through Christ anchored in
continual prayer.

God is available for our quick cry or for a lengthy conversation. He
welcomes us into a relationship with Him, a constant and endless
sharing of our joys and gratitude, needs, questions, and concerns
(Hebrews 4:15–16). We are always in the prayer zone.
