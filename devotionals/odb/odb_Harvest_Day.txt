Harvest Day

Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. —
Galatians 6:7

Today's Scripture: Galatians 6:1-10

One autumn afternoon I drove past a field where a farmer had parked
some massive machinery by the side of the road. A yellow caution sign
read: “Harvest in Progress.” As I glanced over at the field, I knew
instantly what the farmer had planted several months ago—tiny kernels
of corn. I knew this because he was preparing to drive his harvesting
equipment through acres of mature cornstalks.

While it may seem obvious that planting corn leads to harvesting corn,
we sometimes deny the relationship between sowing and reaping in our
spiritual lives. The apostle Paul wrote, “Do not be deceived . . . ;
for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap” (Gal. 6:7). Living to
please our flesh yields corruption in the form of wanting what isn’t
ours, self-centeredness, and even substance abuse (5:19-21). Walking
with the Spirit produces peace, kindness, and self-control (5:22-23).
By God’s grace, we can choose to “sow to the Spirit” and reap eternal
life (6:8).

Suppose Jesus declared today “harvest day” in our lives, and He asked
us to gather up the yield of our everyday choices over the past year.
What would we have to show Him?

Reflect & Pray

Things of the world often pull at my heart, But, Lord, help me see the
end from the start; Open my eyes to where my life’s going, What I will
reap from all I’ve been sowing. —K. DeHaan

The seeds we sow today determine the kind of fruit we’ll reap
tomorrow.
