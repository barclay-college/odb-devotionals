A Prisoner No More

I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but
what I hate I do.
Romans 7:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 7:15-25

A middle-aged man approached me after I led a workshop at his place of
employment and asked this question: “I’ve been a Christian nearly my
whole life, but I’m constantly disappointed in myself. Why is it that
I always seem to keep doing the things I wish I didn’t do and never
seem to do the things I know I should? Isn’t God getting tired of me?”
Two men standing next to me also seemed eager to hear the response.

That’s a common struggle that even the apostle Paul experienced. “I do
not understand what I do,” he said, “For what I want to do I do not
do, but what I hate I do” (Rom. 7:15). But here’s some good news: We
don’t have to stay in that trap of discouragement. To paraphrase Paul
as he writes in Romans 8, the key is to stop focusing on the law and
start focusing on Jesus. We can’t do anything about our sinfulness in
our own strength. The answer is not “try harder to be good at keeping
the rules.” Instead, we must focus on the One who shows us mercy and
cooperate with the Spirit who changes us.

When we focus on the law, we are constantly reminded that we’ll never
be good enough to deserve God’s grace. But when we focus on Jesus, we
become more like Him.

Reflect & Pray

I sometimes get caught in the cycle of trying harder to be good,
failing, getting discouraged, and giving up. Help me, Lord, to depend
on Your grace and to draw near to You so that You can change my heart.

Focus on Jesus.
