It’s Worth It

If I must boast, I will boast in the things which concern my
infirmity. —
2 Corinthians 11:30

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 11:24-33

“I can’t do it,” Robert said, throwing his pencil down in despair.
“It’s just too hard!” Reading, writing, and spelling seemed impossible
to our dyslexic 9-year-old. At last, a solution was offered. But it
was tough. We had to do reading and spelling practice with him for 20
minutes every evening—without exception. Sometimes we just didn’t feel
like doing it, and at times we despaired of seeing progress. But we
were committed to getting Robert’s reading age and his chronological
age to match, so we battled on.

After 2 1/2 years, all the tears and struggles seemed infinitely
worthwhile. Robert learned to read and spell. And we all learned
patient endurance.

The apostle Paul suffered all sorts of hardships as he pursued his
goal of sharing the good news of Jesus with those who had never heard.
Persecuted, beaten, imprisoned, and misunderstood, sometimes he faced
death itself (2 Cor. 11:25). But the joy of seeing people respond to
his message made it all worthwhile.

If you feel that the task God has called you to is too hard, remember
that the spiritual lessons and joy that are wrapped up in the journey
may seem hidden at first, but they are certainly there! God will help
you find them.

Reflect & Pray

Sometimes we learn that hardships Were blessings in disguise, That
earnest work and faith in God Were proven to be wise. —Hess

The journey is as important as the destination.
