Pressing On

That I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the
fellowship of His sufferings. —
Philippians 3:10

Today's Scripture: Philippians 1:12-18; 3:8-11

At a Christian men’s conference, I talked with a longtime friend who
has encouraged and mentored me for many years. With him were two young
men from China, new in their faith and deeply grateful for this man’s
faithful friendship and spiritual help. My friend Clyde, nearing 80
years of age, glowed with enthusiasm as he said, “I’ve never been more
excited about knowing and loving Christ than I am today.”

Paul’s letter to the Philippians reveals a heart and purpose that
never diminished with time: “That I may know Him and the power of His
resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to
His death” (Phil. 3:10). From the root of Paul’s relationship with
Jesus came the fruit of his undiminished fervor that others be guided
to faith in Him. He rejoiced to share the gospel and was encouraged
that others became bolder because of him (1:12-14).

If our goal is merely service for the Lord, we may burn out somewhere
along the line. But if our purpose, like Paul’s and Clyde’s and many
others, is to know Christ and love Him, we’ll find that He will give
us the strength to make Him known to others. Let us joyfully press on
in the strength God gives!

Reflect & Pray

Father God, I want to know You in all Your fullness and to love You
completely. I believe that relationship with You is the basis for my
service for You. Help me not to serve out of my own strength.

Learn from Christ then make Him known.
