Einstein and Jesus

Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world.”
John 8:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 9:1-7

We remember Albert Einstein for more than his disheveled hair, big
eyes, and witty charm. We know him as the genius and physicist who
changed the way we see the world. His famous formula of E=mc2
revolutionized scientific thought and brought us into the nuclear age.
Through his “Special Theory of Relativity” he reasoned that since
everything in the universe is in motion, all knowledge is a matter of
perspective. He believed that the speed of light is the only constant
by which we can measure space, time, or physical mass.

Long before Einstein, Jesus talked about the role of light in
understanding our world, but from a different perspective. To support
His claim to be the Light of the World (John 8:12), Jesus healed a man
who had been blind from birth (9:6). When the Pharisees accused Christ
of being a sinner, this grateful man said, “Whether He is a sinner or
not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I
see” (v. 25).

While Einstein’s ideas would later be proven difficult to test, Jesus’
claims can be tested. We can spend time with Jesus in the Gospels. We
can invite Him into our daily routine. We can see for ourselves that
He can change our perspective on everything.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, You are the one constant in this chaotic world. Thank You
for being the one true Light that the darkness can never extinguish.

Only as we walk in Christ’s light can we live in His love.
