What Kind of Savior Is He?

From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer
followed him.
John 6:66

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 6:47–51, 60–66

Last year, friends and I prayed for healing for three women battling
cancer. We knew God had the power to do this, and we asked Him to do
so every day. We’d seen Him work in the past and believed He could do
it again. There were days in each one’s battle where healing looked
like it was a reality, and we rejoiced. But they all died that fall.
Some said that was “the ultimate healing,” and in a way it was. Still
the loss hurt us deeply. We wanted Him to heal them all—here and
now—but for reasons we couldn’t understand, no miracle came.

Some people followed Jesus for the miracles He performed and to get
their needs met (John 6:2, 26). Some simply saw Him as the carpenter’s
son (Matthew 13:55–58), and others expected Him to be their political
leader (Luke 19:37–38). Some thought of Him as a great teacher
(Matthew 7:28–29), while others quit following Him because His
teaching was hard to understand (John 6:66).

Jesus still doesn’t always meet our expectations of Him. Yet He is so
much more than we can imagine. He’s the provider of eternal life (vv.
47–48). He is good and wise; and He loves, forgives, stays close, and
brings us comfort. May we find rest in Jesus as He is and keep
following Him.
