Wandering Off

Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.
Luke 15:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 15:1–7

Living near cattle ranches as he did, humorist Michael Yaconelli
noticed how cows were prone to wander while grazing. A cow would keep
moving, always looking for the fabled “greener pastures.” Near the
edge of the property, the cow might discover some cool fresh grass
under a shade tree. Just beyond a broken-down part of the fence was a
tasty clump of foliage. Then the cow might push far beyond the fence
and out to the road. It slowly “nibbled” its way into being lost.

Cows aren’t alone in their roaming problem. Sheep also wander, and
it’s likely that people have the biggest tendency of all to stray.

Perhaps that’s one of the reasons God compares us to sheep in the
Bible. It can be easy to meander and “nibble our way” through reckless
compromises and foolish decisions, never noticing how far away from
the truth we’ve strayed.

Jesus told the Pharisees the story of a lost sheep. The sheep was of
such value to the shepherd that he left his other sheep behind while
he searched for the wandering one. And when he found the one that had
strayed, He celebrated! (Luke 15:1–7).

Such is the happiness of God over those who turn back to Him. Jesus
said, “Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep” (v. 6). God has
sent us a Savior to rescue us and bring us home.

Reflect & Pray

In what way might you be wandering in the wrong direction? What’s the
first step you need to take to get back where you belong?

Father in heaven, I feel lost. Have I wandered too far? Redirect my
heart and show me the way home.
