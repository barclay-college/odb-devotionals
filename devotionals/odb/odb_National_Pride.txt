National Pride

—
1 Peter 2:9

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 2:9-17

My wife, Martie, and I have grown to love England—its history,
culture, and people. One of our favorite activities when we visit is
going to outdoor concerts (also known as proms) on the sloping lawns
of ancient estates. “The Last Night of the Proms” event is the best,
with fireworks and hundreds of nationals waving little British flags
to rousing patriotic tunes.

We loved joining the celebration—until the summer our children came
with us. When we started waving our flags with all the enthusiastic
Brits, our kids were aghast. I can still hear them shouting over the
music, “What are you doing?! You’re Americans!”

God must often feel like that when we blend in and live like the
“locals” around us. I can almost hear Him saying, “What are you doing
living like that?! You belong to My nation!”

Peter reminds us that we are different from the locals—we are a “holy
nation” (1 Peter 2:9). Being holy means that we are unique, set apart
for Jesus, becoming like Him, and reflecting His countercultural ways
of living. It means that we are forgiving in the face of cruel
offenses; and merciful, gracious, truthful, and loyal to our promises.
It means being just like Him.

So let’s start waving the flag of holiness as members of the “Jesus
nation”!

Reflect & Pray

O child of God, guard well your life From anything that stains the
heart; Forsake those things that soil the mind— Your Father wants you
set apart. —Fasick

Our loyalty to Jesus should be seen and heard in our lives.
