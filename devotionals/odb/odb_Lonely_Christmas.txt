Lonely Christmas

My eyes are ever on the Lord.
Psalm 25:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 25:14–22

The loneliest Christmas I ever spent was in my grandfather’s cottage
near Sakogu, northern Ghana. I was just fifteen, and my parents and
siblings were a thousand kilometers away. In previous years, when I’d
been with them and my village friends, Christmas was always big and
memorable. But this Christmas was quiet and lonely. As I lay on my
floor mat early Christmas morning, I remembered a local song: The year
has ended; Christmas has come; the Son of God is born; peace and joy
to everybody. Mournfully, I sang it over and over.

My grandmother came and asked, “What song is that?” My grandparents
didn’t know about Christmas—or about Christ. So I shared what I knew
about Christmas with them. Those moments brightened my loneliness.

Alone in the fields with only sheep and occasional predators, the
shepherd boy David experienced loneliness. It would not be the only
time. Later in his life he wrote, “I am lonely and afflicted” (Psalm
25:16). But David didn’t allow loneliness to cause him to be
despondent. Instead, he sang: “My hope, Lord , is in you” (v. 21).

From time to time we all face loneliness. Wherever Christmas may find
you this year, in loneliness or in companionship, you can enjoy the
season with Christ.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You that with You I’m not alone even in my times of
loneliness. This Christmas, help me to enjoy my fellowship with You
and to reach out to others.

With Jesus at Christmas, we’re never alone.
