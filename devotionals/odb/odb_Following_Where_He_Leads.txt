Following Where He Leads

Then [Elisha] set out to follow Elijah and became his servant.
1 Kings 19:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Kings 19:19–21

As a child, I looked forward to our church’s Sunday evening services.
They were exciting. Sunday night often meant we got to hear from
missionaries and other guest speakers. Their messages inspired me
because of their willingness to leave family and friends—and at times,
homes, possessions, and careers—to go off to strange, unfamiliar, and
sometimes dangerous places to serve God.

Like those missionaries, Elisha left many things behind to follow God
(1 Kings 19:19–21). Before God called him into service through Elijah,
we don’t know much about Elisha—except that he was a farmer. When the
prophet Elijah met him in the field where he was plowing, he threw his
cloak over Elisha’s shoulders (the symbol of his role as prophet) and
called him to follow. With only a request to kiss his mother and
father goodbye, Elisha immediately sacrificed his oxen, burned his
plowing equipment, said good-bye to his parents—and followed Elijah.

Though not many of us are called to leave family and friends behind to
serve God as fulltime missionaries, God wants all of us to follow Him
and to “live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned
to [us], just as God has called [us]” (1 Corinthians 7:17). As I’ve
often experienced, serving God can be thrilling and challenging no
matter where we are—even if we never leave home.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, equip us to be Your missionaries wherever You have placed
us—near or far, at home or abroad.

God will show us how to serve Him wherever we are.
