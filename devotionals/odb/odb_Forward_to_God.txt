Forward to God

Give ear, Lord, and hear; open your eyes, Lord, and see.
2 Kings 19:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 19:9-20

In the days before telephones, email, and mobile phones, the telegram
was usually the fastest means of communication. But only important
news was sent by telegram, and such news was usually bad. Hence the
saying, “The telegram boy always brings bad news.”

It was wartime in ancient Israel when Hezekiah was king of Judah.
Sennacherib, king of Assyria, had invaded and captured the cities of
Judah. He then sent a letter to Hezekiah, a bad-news “telegram” urging
his surrender. Hezekiah described the moment as “a day of distress and
rebuke and disgrace” (2 Kings 19:3).

With taunts and scoffs, Sennacherib boasted of his past military
campaigns, belittling the God of Israel and threatening mayhem (vv.
11-13). In that dreadful moment, King Hezekiah did an unusual thing
with the bad-news letter: “He went up to the temple of the Lord and
spread it out before the Lord” (v. 14). Then he prayed earnestly,
acknowledging the power of God over their gloomy situation (vv.
15-19). God intervened in a powerful way (vv. 35-36).

Bad news can reach us at any time. In those moments, Hezekiah’s action
is a good example to follow. Spread out the news before the Lord in
prayer and hear His reassurance: “I have heard your prayer” (v. 20).

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, when people attack us, we tend to react defensively.
Teach us to turn to You instead of taking matters into our own hands.
We trust You and love You. Defend us today.

Prayer is the child’s helpless cry to the Father’s attentive ear.
