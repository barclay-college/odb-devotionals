Horse Power

I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. —
Psalm 139:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 39:19-25

Think for a moment of the power, beauty, and majesty of a galloping
horse—his head held high, his mane flying in the wind, and his legs
working in unison to provide speed, power, and abandon.

What a wonderful example of God’s magnificent creation is the horse!
God created it not just for our amazement and enjoyment but also as a
complement to the human race (Job 39). Properly trained, the horse is
fearless when we need a courageous companion. The horse was used to
carry the soldier faithfully into conflict with speed (v.24) and
anticipation (v.25).

Although God was using creation to teach Job about His sovereignty, we
can also be reminded through this passage about our own value in God’s
world. We are created not simply as a beautiful creature with a job to
do but also as a creature made in God’s image. The power of the horse
is amazing, but the value of each human transcends all other
creatures.

God created us uniquely to have a relationship with Him and to live
with Him forever. While we praise God for the magnificence of the
creatures of nature, we also stand in awe that we are “fearfully and
wonderfully made” (Ps. 139:14).

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, our Almighty God and Father, for Your creation. You have
provided so many majestic creatures for us to enjoy, but help us to
recognize with thankfulness the special place we have in creation.

Of all God’s creation, only humans can experience re-creation.
