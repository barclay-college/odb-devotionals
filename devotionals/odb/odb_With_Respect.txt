With Respect

If it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of
Babylon to see if King Cyrus . . . issue[d] a decree.
Ezra 5:17

Today's Scripture: Ezra 5:6-17

The citizens of Israel were having some trouble with the government.
It was the late 500s bc, and the Jewish people were eager to complete
their temple that had been destroyed in 586 bc by Babylon. However,
the governor of their region was not sure they should be doing that,
so he sent a note to King Darius (Ezra 5:6-17).

In the letter, the governor says he found the Jews working on the
temple and asks the king if they had permission to do so. The letter
also records the Jews’ respectful response that they had indeed been
given permission by an earlier king (Cyrus) to rebuild. When the king
checked out their story, he found it to be true: King Cyrus had said
they could build the temple. So Darius not only gave them permission
to rebuild, but he also paid for it! (see 6:1-12). After the Jews
finished building the temple, they “celebrated with joy” because they
knew God had “[changed] the attitude of the king” (6:22).

When we see a situation that needs to be addressed, we honor God when
we plead our case in a respectful way, trust that He is in control of
every situation, and express gratitude for the outcome.
