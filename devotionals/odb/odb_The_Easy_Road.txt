The Easy Road?

When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road
through the Philistine country, though that was shorter.
Exodus 13:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 13:17–22

Life’s path is often difficult. So if we expect that God will always
give us an easy road, we may be tempted to turn our back on Him when
the terrain gets tough.

If you’ve ever considered doing that, think about the people of
Israel. When they were given freedom from the Egyptians after hundreds
of years of bondage, they took off for the Promised Land. But God
didn’t send them straight home. He “did not lead them on the road
through the Philistine country, though that was shorter” (Ex. 13:17).
Instead He sent them on the hard road through the desert. In the short
run, this helped them avoid wars (v. 17), but in the long run, there
was something bigger at work.

God used that time in the desert to instruct and mature the people He
had called to follow Him. The easy road would have led them to
disaster. The long road prepared the nation of Israel for their
successful entry into the Promised Land.

Our God is faithful, and we can trust Him to lead us and care for us
no matter what we face. We may not understand the reason for the path
we are on, but we can trust Him to help us grow in faith and maturity
along the way.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we cannot see the path ahead, so we must trust that the way is
right and that it is the best road for us to take. Please encourage
us, and teach us as we let You direct our path.

God’s timing is always right—wait patiently for Him.
