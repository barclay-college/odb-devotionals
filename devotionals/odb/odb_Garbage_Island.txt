Garbage Island

The waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good. —
Genesis 1:10

Today's Scripture: Genesis 1:20-28; 2:15

The other day I ran across a troubling report about people who think
it is acceptable to use the ocean as a giant garbage dump. Here is an
excerpt: “If you should see this amazing floating pile of plastic in
the Pacific Ocean, it’s called ‘The Great Pacific Garbage Patch.’ It
features three million tons of plastic debris floating in an area
larger than Texas. An eye-popping 46,000 pieces of plastic float on
every square mile of ocean!” Other sources estimate the amount of
garbage is even bigger. Plastic is especially bad because it does not
dissolve.

During our sojourn on earth, we have been charged, like Adam, with
taking care of the earth and its creatures that God has given us.
Genesis 2:15 says, “The Lord God took the man and put him in the
garden of Eden to tend and keep it.” God delights in what He has made
and this extends to the sea and all that live in it (1:10,20-21).

This world should remind us of the greatness of our Creator and serve
as a springboard of praise to Him. Indifferently using it as a garbage
dump mars its beauty and threatens the creatures that live here.
Showing respect and caring for the land, the ocean, and the air is our
duty as believers in Christ.
