Seeing God’s Hand

He came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
—
Ezra 7:9

Today's Scripture: Ezra 7:1-10,27-28

On Jack Borden’s 101st birthday, he awoke at 5 a.m., ate a hearty
breakfast, and was at his law office by 6:30 ready to begin his day.
When asked the secret of his long life, the practicing attorney smiled
and quipped, “Not dying.”

But there’s more to it than that. Mr. Borden, who was baptized at age
11 in the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, told Fort Worth (Texas)
Star-Telegram reporter David Casstevens, “I’m a firm believer that God
has His hand in everything that happens. He is letting me live for
some reason. I try to do the things that I believe He wants me to.”

Ezra the priest experienced the “good hand of his God upon him” when
he led a delegation to Jerusalem to provide spiritual leadership for
the former captives who were rebuilding the temple and the city (Ezra
7:9-10). Ezra found strength and courage in knowing that the Lord was
with them each step of the way. “So I was encouraged, as the hand of
the Lord my God was upon me; and I gathered leading men of Israel to
go up with me” (v.28).

When we see the Lord’s hand in our lives, it brings forth a deep
“Thank You” and a growing desire to do what He wants us to do.

Reflect & Pray

If we would view through eyes of faith The course of each new day,
We’d quickly see God’s gracious hand In all that comes our way. —D. De
Haan

If you know that God’s hand is in everything, you can leave everything
in God’s hands.
