The Miracle of White Snow

Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
Isaiah 1:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 1:15–20

In the seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton used a prism to study how
light helps us see different colors. He found that when light passes
through an object, the object appears to possess a specific color.
While a single ice crystal looks translucent, snow is made up of many
ice crystals smashed together. When light passes through all of the
crystals, snow appears to be white.

The Bible mentions something else that has a certain color—sin.
Through the prophet Isaiah, God confronted the sins of the people of
Judah and described their sin as “like scarlet” and as “red as
crimson.” But God promised they would “be as white as snow” (Isaiah
1:18). How? Judah needed to turn away from wrongdoing and seek God’s
forgiveness.

Thanks to Jesus, we have permanent access to God’s forgiveness. Jesus
called Himself “the light of the world” and said whoever follows Him
“will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (John
8:12). When we confess our sins, God forgives us and we’re seen
through the light of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. This means that
God sees us as He sees Jesus—blameless.

We don’t have to wallow in the guilt and shame of what we’ve done
wrong. Instead, we can hold on to the truth of God’s forgiveness,
which makes us “white as snow.”

Reflect & Pray

What does it mean to be completely forgiven? What helps you remember
that God has forgiven you?

Heavenly Father, thank You for the forgiveness You freely offer.
