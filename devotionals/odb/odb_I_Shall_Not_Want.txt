I Shall Not Want

The world is Mine, and all its fullness. —
Psalm 50:12

Today's Scripture: James 4:1-10

Before they were a week old, the eaglets were fighting over food.
Neither was strong enough to hold up his head for more than a few
seconds, so the pair looked like fuzzballs with bobble-heads attached.
But whenever the parents brought food to the nest, the bigger eaglet
was quick to peck down his brother to keep him from getting a single
bite. His aggression would have been understandable if food was
scarce, or if the parents couldn’t be trusted to supply what he
needed. But nothing could be further from the truth. The eaglets were
being fed fish many times their size; there was more than enough for
both of them.

The greedy eaglet reminds me of our own foolishness when we try to get
for ourselves something that belongs to someone else (James 4:1-5).
Conflicts erupt because we want something that God has given to a
friend, colleague, relative, or neighbor. Instead of asking God for
what we need, we try to get what He’s given to someone else (v.2). But
God has something good for each of us. We don’t need what belongs to
anyone else. And we certainly never need to harm anyone to get what we
need.

Our loving heavenly Father has more than enough for everyone.

Reflect & Pray

The secret of contentment is To let the Lord supply; Just do your part
and put God first And on His Word rely. —D. De Haan

Our needs will never exhaust God’s supply.
