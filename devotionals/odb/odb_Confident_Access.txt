Confident Access

Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may
obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. —
Hebrews 4:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 4:14-16

Mont Saint-Michel is a tidal island located about a half-mile off the
coast of Normandy, France. For centuries it has been the site of an
abbey and monastery that has attracted religious pilgrims. Until the
construction of a causeway, it was notorious for its dangerous access
that resulted in the death of some pilgrims. At low tide it is
encompassed by sand banks, and at high tide it is surrounded by water.
Accessing the island was a cause for fear.

Access to God for Old Testament Jews was also a cause for fear. When
God thundered on Mt. Sinai, the people feared approaching Him (Ex.
19:10-16). And when access to God was granted through the high priest,
specific instructions had to be followed (Lev. 16:1-34). Accidentally
touching the ark of the covenant, which represented the holy presence
of God, would result in death (see 2 Sam. 6:7-8).

But because of Jesus’ death and resurrection, we can now approach God
without fear. God’s penalty for sin has been satisfied, and we are
invited into God’s presence: “Let us therefore come boldly to the
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace” (Heb. 4:16).

Because of Jesus we can come to God through prayer anywhere, anytime.
