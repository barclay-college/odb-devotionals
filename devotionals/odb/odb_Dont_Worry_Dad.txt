“Don’t Worry, Dad!”

The glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard. —
Isaiah 58:8

Today's Scripture: Exodus 14:19-25

Last summer, my husband and I hosted a concert and fundraiser for
childhood cancer research. We planned to have the event in our
backyard, but weather forecasts were dismal. A few hours before the
event, we began calling our 100+ guests to inform them of a change in
venue. As our friends and family began feverishly toting food,
decorations, and equipment from our house to our church gym, our
daughter Rosie took a moment to give her dad a hug and remind him on
behalf of the kids and grandkids that they were there for him: “Don’t
worry, Dad! We’ve got your back.”

Hearing that expression is comforting because it reminds us that we’re
not on our own. Someone is saying, “I’m here. I’ll take care of
whatever you might miss. I’ll be a second set of eyes and hands for
you.”

As the Israelites were escaping a life of slavery, Pharaoh sent his
army of chariots and horsemen to give chase (Ex. 14:17). But “the
Angel of God . . . and the pillar of cloud went from before them and
stood behind them” (v.19). In this way, God hid and protected them
throughout the night. The next day, He parted the Red Sea so they
could safely cross over.

God tells us “Don’t worry” as well. “If God is for us, who can be
against us?” (Rom. 8:31).

God’s hand that holds the ocean’s depths Can hold my small affairs;
His hand that guides the universe Can carry all my cares. —Anon.

Our work is to cast care; God’s work is to take care!
