Building A Bridge

Your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to say
anything. —
1 Thessalonians 1:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 1:1-10

James Michener’s Centennial is a fictional account of the history and
settlement of the American West. Through the eyes of a French-Canadian
trader named Pasquinel, Michener converges the stories of the Arapaho
of the Great Plains and the European-based community of St. Louis. As
this rugged adventurer moves between the growing clutter of the city
and the wide-open spaces of the plains, he becomes a bridge between
two drastically different worlds.

Followers of Christ also have the opportunity to build bridges between
two very different worlds—those who know and follow Jesus and those
who do not know Him. Early Christians in Thessalonica had been
building bridges to their idol-worshiping culture, so Paul said of
them, “For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only
in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place” (1 Thess. 1:8). The
bridge they were building had two components: the “word of the Lord”
and the example of their faith. It was clear to everyone that they had
“turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God” (v.9).

As God declares Himself to those around us by His Word and through our
lives, we can become a bridge to those who do not yet know the love of
Christ.

Reflect & Pray

Father, help us live in such a way that others will want to know about
Your Son. May we not merely try to do what’s “right” but instead live
as people forgiven and loved by You.

Live the gospel, and others will listen.
