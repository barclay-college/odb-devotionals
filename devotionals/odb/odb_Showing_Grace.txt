Showing Grace

Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so
that you may know how to answer everyone.
Colossians 4:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 4:2–6

The US Masters Golf Tournament began in 1934, and since then only
three players have won it two years in a row. On April 10, 2016, it
appeared that twenty-two-year-old Jordan Spieth would become the
fourth. But he faltered on the last nine holes and finished in a tie
for second. Despite his disappointing loss, Spieth was gracious toward
tournament champion Danny Willett, congratulating him on his victory
and on the birth of his first child, something “more important than
golf.”

Writing in The New York Times, Karen Krouse said, “It takes grace to
see the big picture so soon after having to sit through a trophy
ceremony and watch someone else have his photograph taken.” Krouse
continued, “Spieth’s ball-striking was off all week, but his character
emerged unscathed.”

Paul urged the followers of Jesus in Colossae to “be wise in the way
you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your
conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you
may know how to answer everyone” (Col. 4:5–6).

As those who have freely received God’s grace, it is our privilege and
calling to demonstrate it in every situation of life—win or lose.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me by Your Spirit to be gracious and kind to others
and to represent You well.

Gracious words are always the right words.
