Breathtaking

A man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be
merry; for this will remain with him in his labor all the days of his
life. —
Ecclesiastes 8:15

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 2:1-11

A popular slogan says, “Life is not measured by the number of breaths
we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.” I see the
phrase everywhere, on everything from T-shirts to pieces of art. It’s
a catchy phrase, but I think it’s misleading.

If we measure life by breathtaking moments, we miss the wonder of
ordinary moments. Eating, sleeping, and breathing seem “ordinary” in
that we do them every day, usually without much thought. But they are
not ordinary at all. Every bite and every breath are miracles. In
fact, having breath is more miraculous than anything that takes our
breath away.

King Solomon may have had more breathtaking moments than anyone. He
said, “I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure” (Eccl. 2:10).
But he expressed cynicism about it by saying, “All of it is
meaningless” (v.17 NIV).

Solomon’s life reminds us that it’s important to find joy in
“ordinary” things, for they are indeed wonderful. Bigger is not always
better. More is not always an improvement. Busier doesn’t make us more
important.

Rather than look for meaning in breathtaking moments, we should find
meaning in every breath we take, and make every breath meaningful.

Reflect & Pray

All that I want is in Jesus; He satisfies, joy He supplies; Life would
be worthless without Him, All things in Jesus I find. —Loes

Breathing is more miraculous than anything that takes our breath away.
