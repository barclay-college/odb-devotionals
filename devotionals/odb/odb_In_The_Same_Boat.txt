In The Same Boat

When He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. —
Matthew 8:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 8:23-27

When the cruise ship pulled into port, the passengers got off as
quickly as possible. They had spent the last few days enduring an
outbreak of a virus, and hundreds of people had been sickened. One
passenger, interviewed as he disembarked, said: “Well, I don’t mean to
complain so much. I mean I know everybody was in the same boat.” His
seemingly unintentional pun made the reporter smile.

In Matthew 8, we read about another trip on the water (vv.23-27).
Jesus got into the boat and the disciples followed Him (v.23). Then a
terrible storm arose, and Jesus’ disciples feared for their lives.
They awakened a sleeping Jesus, who they assumed was unaware of the
crisis.

While Jesus was literally in the same boat as His followers, He was
unconcerned about the weather. As the all-powerful Creator, He had no
fear of a storm. “He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and
there was a great calm” (v.26).

But we are not all-powerful, and we are oh-so-prone to fear. So what
are we to do when the storms of life rage around us? Whether they
quickly blow over or last for a long time, we can be confident in
this: We are in the same boat with the One whom even the winds and the
sea obey.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, this life is full of uncertainty. But You have
promised us Your unfailing presence. May we see You today—especially
when we are tempted to panic or to do things in our own strength.

No danger can come so near the Christian that God is not nearer.
