In The Neighborhood

The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. —
John 1:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 1:1-14

It was the buzz of our neighborhood. A famous professional football
player had moved in just two houses down from where we lived. We had
seen him on television and read about his great skills on the field,
but we never thought he would choose to reside in our neighborhood.
Initially, our expectations were that we would welcome him into the
neighborhood and we would all become great friends. But his life was
obviously far too busy for any of us to get to know him personally.

Imagine this: Jesus—the Lord of the universe and Creator of all
things—chose to dwell among us! He left heaven and came to this earth.
As John says, “We beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten
of the Father” (John 1:14). Jesus chose to become intimately involved
with all who will come to Him. And, even more significant, for those
of us who have received His redeeming love, the Holy Spirit has now
set up residence in our hearts to comfort, counsel, convict, lead, and
teach us.

When you think of the Babe in the manger, remember how special it is
that He not only moved into our “neighborhood,” but that He did it so
He could bless us with the intimate privileges of His residence within
us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I’m amazed that You, the greatest One of all, would take up
residence within us! Help us to treasure the gift of Your presence as
our ultimate joy. Draw us to Yourself to enjoy intimacy with You.

Take advantage of the gift of God’s presence.
