Who You Are

What is mankind that you are mindful of them?
Psalm 8:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 8

His name is Dnyan, and he considers himself a student of the world.
And “this is a very big school,” he says of all the cities and towns
he’s passed through. He began a four-year journey on his bicycle in
2016 to meet and learn from people. When there’s a language barrier,
he finds that sometimes people can understand just by looking at each
other. He also depends on a translation app on his phone to
communicate. He doesn’t measure his journey in the miles he’s traveled
or the sights he’s seen. Instead, he measures it in the people who’ve
left an imprint on his heart: “Maybe I do not know your language, but
I would like to find out who you are.”

It’s a very big world, yet God knows everything about it and the
people in it—fully and completely. The psalmist David was in awe of
God when he considered all the works of His hands: the making of the
heavens, the moon, and the stars (Psalm 8:3). He wondered, “What is
mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for
them?” (v. 4).

God knows you more thoroughly than anyone else possibly can and He
cares for you. We can only respond, “ Lord , our Lord, how majestic is
your name in all the earth!” (vv. 1, 9).

Reflect & Pray

How do you feel knowing that God knows all about you and loves you?
What does believing this truth look like in your life today?

Dear God, it’s awesome to realize that You’re all-knowing about Your
whole creation. I love You for knowing me personally too.
