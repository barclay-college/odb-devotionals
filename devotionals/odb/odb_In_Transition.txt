In Transition

We will be with the Lord forever.
1 Thessalonians 4:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 11:17-27

People post obituary notices on billboards and concrete block walls in
Ghana regularly. Headlines such as Gone Too Soon, Celebration of Life,
and What a Shock! announce the passing away of loved ones and the
approaching funerals. One I read—In Transition—points to life beyond
the grave.

When a close relative or friend dies, we sorrow as Mary and Martha did
for their brother Lazarus (John 11:17-27). We miss the departed so
much that our hearts break and we weep, as Jesus wept at the passing
of His friend (v. 35).

Yet, it was at this sorrowful moment Jesus made a delightful statement
on life after death: “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who
believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by
believing in me will never die” (v. 25).

On the basis of this we give departed believers only a temporary
farewell. For they “will be with the Lord forever,” Paul emphasizes (1
Thess. 4:17). Of course, farewells are painful, but we can rest
assured that they are in the Lord’s safe hands.

In Transition suggests that we are only changing from one situation to
another. Though life on earth ends for us, we will continue to live
forever and better in the next life where Jesus is. “Therefore
encourage one another with these words” (v. 18).
