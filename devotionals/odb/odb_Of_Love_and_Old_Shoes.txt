Of Love and Old Shoes

Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely.
Psalm 139:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:1–12

Sometimes my wife and I finish each other’s sentences. In over thirty
years of marriage we’ve become increasingly familiar with the way the
other thinks and speaks. We may not even have to finish a sentence at
all; just a word or a glance is enough to express a thought.

There’s comfort in that—like an old pair of shoes you continue to wear
because they fit so well. Sometimes we even refer to each other
affectionately as “my old shoe”—a compliment that might be difficult
to understand if you didn’t know us well! Through the years our
relationship has developed a language of its own, with expressions
that are the result of decades of love and trust.

It’s comforting to know that God loves us with a deep familiarity.
David wrote, “Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it
completely” (Ps. 139:4). Imagine having a quiet conversation with
Jesus where you’re telling Him the deepest matters of your heart. Just
when you’re struggling to get the words out, He gives you a knowing
smile and expresses exactly what you couldn’t quite say. How good it
is to know that we don’t have to get our words just right to talk to
God! He loves us and knows us well enough to understand.
