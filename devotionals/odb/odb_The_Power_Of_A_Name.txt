The Power Of A Name

The name of the Lord is a strong tower. —
Proverbs 18:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 18:1-10

Nicknames are often descriptive of some noticeable aspect of a
person’s character or physical attributes. Growing up, my elementary
school friends brutally called me “liver lips” since at that stage of
development my lips seemed disproportionately large. Needless to say,
I have always been glad that the name didn’t stick.

Unlike my nickname, I love the names of God that describe His
magnificent characteristics. God is so wonderfully multifaceted that
He has many names that communicate His capabilities and character. To
name just a few, He is:

Elohim, the God above all gods

Jehovah Jireh, the God who provides

El-Shaddai, the almighty God

Jehovah Rapha, our healer God

Jehovah Shalom, our God of peace

Jehovah Shamma, our God who is present

Jehovah Yahweh, our loving, covenant-keeping God

It’s no wonder the writer of Proverbs encourages us to remember that
“the name of the Lord is a strong tower,” that in times of need God-
fearing people run to it and “are safe” (Prov. 18:10). When unwelcome
circumstances threaten you and you feel vulnerable, reflect on one of
God’s names. Be assured—He will be faithful to His name.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, remind us that Your names reveal Your character. Help us to
remember them in our times of need and distress. Thank You for the
assurance that You are faithful to Your name.

God’s names, which describe His character, can bring comfort when we
need it most.
