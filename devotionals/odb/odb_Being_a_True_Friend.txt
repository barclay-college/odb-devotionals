Being a True Friend

Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine.
Genesis 14:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 14:17–24

Poet Samuel Foss wrote, “Let me live by the side of the road and be a
friend to man” (“The House by the Side of the Road”). That’s what I
want to be—a friend of people. I want to stand by the way, waiting for
weary travelers. To look for those who have been battered and wronged
by others, who carry the burden of a wounded and disillusioned heart.
To nourish and refresh them with an encouraging word and send them on
their way. I may not be able to “fix” them or their problems, but I
can leave them with a blessing.

Melchizedek, both the king of Salem and a priest, blessed Abram when
he was returning weary from battle (Gen. 14). A “blessing” is more
than a polite response to a sneeze. We bless others when we bring them
to the One who is the source of blessing. Melchizedek blessed Abram,
saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and
earth” (v. 19).

We can bless others by praying with them; we can take them with us to
the throne of grace to find help in time of need (Heb. 4:16). We may
not be able to change their circumstances, but we can show them God.
That’s what a true friend does.

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, teach us to be a friend of people as You are with us. Give us
eyes to see others and their needs and to take the time to listen.
Help us to take them to You, the source of life.

A big part of loving is listening.
