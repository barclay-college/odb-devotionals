A “Yes” of Love

Let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.
1 John 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 3:16–24

On August 21, 2016, Carissa posted photos on social media of a
devastating flood in Louisiana. The next morning she included a note
from someone in the flooded area pleading for help. Five hours after
that, she and her husband, Bobby, sent out a call for others to join
them on their 1,000-mile trip to provide help. Less than twenty-four
hours later, thirteen people were on their way to serve those whose
homes had been severely damaged.

What motivates people to drop everything and drive seventeen hours to
move appliances, do demolition work, and provide hope in a place
they’ve never been before? It’s love.

Think about this verse, which she posted along with her call for help:
“Commit your way to the Lord ; trust in him and he will do this”
(Psalm 37:5). This is especially true when we follow God’s call to
help. The apostle John said, “If anyone . . . sees a brother or sister
in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that
person?” (1 John 3:17). It may be a daunting task—but we have God’s
promise of help when we “do what pleases him” (v. 22).

When a need arises, we can honor God by being willing to offer a “yes”
of love to what we sense He is asking us to do for others.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please open our eyes to the needs of others, open our hearts to
those people, and open our hands so we can provide help in the time of
need.

We show God’s love when we are willing to help others; we show His
strength when we take on the task He gives us to do.
