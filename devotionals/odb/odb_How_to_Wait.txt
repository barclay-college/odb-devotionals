How to Wait

Hear my voice when I call, Lord; be merciful to me and answer me.
Psalm 27:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 27:1–3, 7–14

Frustrated and disappointed with church, seventeen-year-old Trevor
began a years-long quest for answers. But nothing he explored seemed
to satisfy his longings or answer his questions.

His journey did draw him closer to his parents. Still, he had problems
with Christianity. During one discussion, he exclaimed bitterly, “The
Bible is full of empty promises.”

Another man faced disappointment and hardship that fueled his doubts.
But as David fled from enemies who sought to kill him, his response
was not to run from God but to praise Him. “Though war break out
against me, even then I will be confident,” he sang (Psalm 27:3).

Yet David’s poem still hints at doubt. His cry, “Be merciful to me and
answer me” (v. 7), sounds like a man with fears and questions. “Do not
hide your face from me,” David pleaded. “Do not reject me or forsake
me” (v. 9).

David didn’t let his doubts paralyze him, however. Even in those
doubts, he declared, “I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land
of the living” (v. 13). Then he addressed his readers: you, me, and
the Trevors of this world. “Wait for the Lord ; be strong and take
heart and wait for the L ord ” (v. 14).

We won’t find fast, simple answers to our huge questions. But we will
find—when we wait for Him—a God who can be trusted.

Reflect & Pray

What do you do with your big questions? Where have you seen answers
“in the land of the living” (Psalm 27:13), and where are you still
waiting for answers?

Father, melt my heart along with my fears and my anger.
