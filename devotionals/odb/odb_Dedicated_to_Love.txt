Dedicated to Love

My heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they
may be saved.
Romans 10:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 9:1–5

As a convert to Jesus Christ, Nabeel Qureshi has written books to help
his readers understand the people in the religion he left. His tone is
respectful, and Qureshi always displays a heart of love for his
people.

Qureshi dedicated one of his books to his sister, who has not yet put
her faith in Jesus. The dedication is brief, but powerful. “I am
begging God for the day that we can worship him together,” he wrote.

We get a sense of that kind of love as we read Paul’s letter to the
church in Rome. “My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending
grief,” he said, “for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters. I
would be willing to be forever cursed—cut off from Christ!—if that
would save them” (Romans 9:2–3 nlt ).

Paul loved the Jewish people so much that he would have chosen
separation from God if only they would accept Christ. He understood
that by rejecting Jesus, his people were rejecting the one true God.
This motivated him to appeal to his readers to share the good news of
Jesus with everyone (10:14–15).

Today, may we prayerfully dedicate ourselves to the love that aches
for those close to us!
