You’re an Original

Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his.
Psalm 100:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 100

Each of us is an original from God’s hand. There are no self-made men
or women. No one ever became talented, buffed, or bright all by
himself or herself. God made each of us all by Himself. He thought of
us and formed us out of His unspeakable love.

God made your body, mind, and soul. And He isn’t done with you; He is
still making you. His single-minded purpose is our maturity: “He who
began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day
of Christ Jesus” (Phil. 1:6). God is making you braver, stronger,
purer, more peaceful, more loving, less selfish—the kind of person
you’ve perhaps always wanted to be.

“[God’s] unfailing love continues forever and his faithfulness
continues to each generation” (Ps. 100:5 nlt ). God has always loved
you (“forever” goes both ways), and He will be faithful to you to the
end.

You’ve been given a love that lasts forever and a God who will never
give up on you. That’s a good reason to have joy and to “come before
him with joyful songs”! (v. 2).

If you can’t carry a tune, just give Him a shout-out: “Shout for joy
to the Lord” (v. 1).

Reflect & Pray

I’m grateful, Father, that You are at work in me. I find it difficult
to change and I wonder sometimes how or if I ever will. Yet I know
that You are continuing Your work in me and as I look back I will see
the growth You are producing. Thank You!

Spiritual growth occurs when faith is cultivated.
