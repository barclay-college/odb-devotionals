Coverups Stink

Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. —
Psalm 32:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 32:1-5

The smell at an overflowing garbage landfill site became a growing
public concern. So workers installed high-pressured deodorant guns to
counteract the smell. The cannons could spray several gallons of
fragrance a minute over a distance of up to 50 yards across the mounds
of putrefying garbage. However, no matter how many gallons of
deodorant are sprayed to mask the odorous rubbish, the fragrance will
serve only as a coverup until the source of the stench is removed.

King David tried a coverup as well. After his adultery with Bathsheba,
he attempted to use silence, deceit, and piety to mask his moral
failures (2 Sam. 11–12). In Psalm 32 he talks about experiencing the
intense convicting hand of God when he remained silent (vv.3-4).
Unable to withstand the conviction any longer, David uncovered his sin
by acknowledging, confessing, and repenting of it (v.5). He no longer
needed to cover it because God forgave him.

It’s futile to try to hide our sin. The stench of our disobedience
will seep through whatever we use to try to cover it. Let’s
acknowledge to God the rubbish in our hearts and experience the fresh
cleansing of His grace and forgiveness.

Reflect & Pray

Father, I know that I cannot hide my sins from You for You know what’s
in my heart. I confess them now to You. Cleanse me, forgive me, and
help me to make a brand-new start. Amen.

Own up to your sin and experience the joy of confession.
