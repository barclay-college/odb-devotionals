Remembering . . .

I have hidden your word in my heart.
Psalm 119:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:17–19, 130–134

One difficult part of growing older is the fear of dementia and the
loss of short-term memory. But Dr. Benjamin Mast, an expert on the
topic of Alzheimer’s disease, offers some encouragement. He says that
patients’ brains are often so “well worn” and “habitual” that they can
hear an old hymn and sing along to every word. He suggests that
spiritual disciplines such as reading Scripture, praying, and singing
hymns cause truth to become “embedded” in our brains, ready to be
accessed when prompted.

In Psalm 119:11, we read how the power of hiding God’s words in our
heart can keep us from sinning. It can strengthen us, teach us
obedience, and direct our footsteps (vv. 28, 67, 133). This in turn
gives us hope and understanding (vv. 49, 130). Even when we begin to
notice memory slips in ourselves or in the life of a loved one, God’s
Word, memorized years earlier, is still there, “stored up” or
“treasured” in the heart (v. 11 esv, nasb). Even as our minds lose the
keen edge of youth, we know that God’s words, hidden in our hearts,
will continue to speak to us.

Nothing—not even failing memories—can separate us from His love and
care. We have His word on it.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You are such an amazing comfort to us. Thank You that our
salvation and spiritual well-being does not depend on our failing
minds and bodies, but on You and Your faithfulness to Your Word.

God's promises never fail.
