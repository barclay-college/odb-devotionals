Joy

I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. —
Luke 2:10

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:8-12

After Adam and Eve disobeyed God, joy was lost. God expelled them from
their garden home to prevent something worse from happening. If they
had eaten from the tree of life after eating from the tree of
knowledge of good and evil, they would have lived forever in their
misery.

Life outside the garden was not easy. Adam and Eve had to work hard
for their food. The reality of death was everywhere, and animals
preyed on one another. Even worse, the couple’s firstborn son murdered
his younger brother. What could be worse? Sin had pierced their lives,
and the couple could not stop joy from draining out.

But God had a plan to restore joy. Joy was lost in the Garden when
death came, but joy returned through birth—the birth of God’s own Son.
“I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people”
(Luke 2:10). Jesus grew up to heal the sick, give sight to the blind,
and raise the dead. But this was just a taste of things to come. God
entered our world, experienced our sorrow, and conquered death, giving
us hope that He will keep His promise to end pain, and eliminate
sorrow and death (John 11:25-26; 1 Cor. 15:3-4; Rev. 21:4). No wonder
Christmas is the season of joy!
