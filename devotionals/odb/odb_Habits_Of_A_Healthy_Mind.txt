Habits Of A Healthy Mind

Trust in the Lord, and do good. —
Psalm 37:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 37:1-8

There is much said today about improving our health by developing
habits of optimism, whether facing a difficult medical diagnosis or a
pile of dirty laundry. Barbara Fredrickson, PhD, a psychology
professor at the University of North Carolina, says we should try
activities that build joy, gratitude, love, and other positive
feelings. We know, however, that more is required than a general wish
for good feelings. We need a strong conviction that there is a source
of joy, peace, and love upon which we can depend.

Psalm 37:1-8 gives positive actions we can take as an antidote to
pessimism and discouragement. Consider these mood boosters: Trust in
the Lord, do good, dwell in the land, feed on His faithfulness (v.3);
delight in the Lord (v.4); commit your way to the Lord, trust in Him
(v.5); rest in the Lord, wait patiently for Him, do not fret (v.7);
cease from anger, forsake wrath (v.8).

Because they are connected to the phrase “in the Lord,” those
directives are more than wishful thinking or unrealistic suggestions.
It’s because of Jesus, and in His strength, that they become possible.

Our one true source for optimism is the redemption that is in Jesus.
He is our reason for hope!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we can’t manufacture hope, and even if we tried it wouldn’t be
real. Help us to find hope in You because of what Jesus has done for
us. We know You are walking beside us.

When there’s bad news, our hope is the good news of Jesus.
