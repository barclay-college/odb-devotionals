Please Come In

Let us draw near to God . . . with the full assurance that faith
brings.
Hebrews 10:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 10:19-25

Jenny’s house is situated on a little country lane, which is often
used in rush hour by drivers who want to avoid the nearby main road
and traffic lights. A few weeks ago workmen arrived to repair the
badly damaged road surface, bringing with them large barriers and “No
Entry” signs. “I was really worried at first,” said Jenny, “thinking
that I would be unable to get my car out until the road work was
finished. But then I went to look at the signs more closely and
realized that they said ‘No Entry: Access for Residents Only.’ No
detours or barriers for me. I had the right to go in and out whenever
I liked because I lived there. I felt very special!”

In the Old Testament, access to God in the tabernacle and the temple
was strictly limited. Only the high priest could go in through the
curtain and offer sacrifices in the Most Holy Place, and then only
once a year (Lev. 16:2-20; Heb. 9:25-26). But at the very moment Jesus
died, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom,
showing that the barrier between man and God was destroyed forever
(Mark 15:38).

Because of Christ’s sacrifice for our sins, all those who love and
follow Him can come into His presence at any time. He has given us the
right of access.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for paying such a price to enable me to have
unrestricted entry into Your presence!

Access to God’s throne is always open.
