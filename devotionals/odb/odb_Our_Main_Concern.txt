Our Main Concern

If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of
Christ.
Galatians 1:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 1:6-10

Peer pressure is part of everyday life. Sometimes we base our
decisions on what other people will think or say rather than on our
convictions and on what will please God. We’re worried that we’ll be
judged or made fun of.

The apostle Paul experienced his fair share of peer pressure. Some
Jewish Christians believed that Gentiles should be circumcised to be
truly saved (Gal. 1:7; see 6:12-15). However, Paul stood his ground.
He continued to preach that salvation is by grace through faith alone;
no further works are required. And for that he was accused of being a
self-appointed apostle. They further asserted that his version of the
gospel had never received the apostles’ approval (2:1-10).

Despite the pressure, Paul was very clear about whom he served—Christ.
God’s approval mattered most, not man’s. He made it his goal not to
win the approval of people, but of God (1:10).

Similarly, we are Christ’s servants. We serve God whether people honor
or despise us, whether they slander or praise us. One day “each of us
will give an account of ourselves to God” (Rom. 14:12). That doesn’t
mean that we shouldn’t consider what people think or say, but
ultimately, we make pleasing God our main concern. We want to hear our
Savior say, “Well done, good and faithful servant!” (Matt. 25:23).
