The Best Is Yet to Come

The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting
arms.
Deuteronomy 33:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 34:1–12

Are the best days of your life behind or in front of you? Our outlook
on life—and our answer to that question—can change with time. When
we’re younger, we look ahead, wanting to grow up. And once we’ve grown
older, we yearn for the past, wanting to be young again. But when we
walk with God, whatever our age, the best is yet to come!

Over the course of his long life, Moses witnessed the amazing things
God did, and many of those amazing things happened when he was no
longer a young man. Moses was 80 years old when he confronted Pharaoh
and saw God miraculously set His people free from slavery (Ex. 3–13).
Moses saw the Red Sea part, saw manna fall from heaven, and even spoke
with God “face to face” (14:21; 16:4; 33:11).

Throughout his life, Moses lived expectantly, looking ahead to what
God would do (Heb. 11:24–27). He was 120 years old in his final year
of life on this earth, and even then he understood that his life with
God was just getting started and that he would never see an end to
God’s greatness and love.

Regardless of our age, “the eternal God is [our] refuge, and
underneath are the everlasting arms” (Deut. 33:27) that faithfully
carry us into His joy each day.

Reflect & Pray

O Lord my God, I praise You for all You have done in the past. I look
forward with thankfulness for all You will do in the future. And I
thank You for today and all Your blessings.

When we walk with God, the best is yet to come.
