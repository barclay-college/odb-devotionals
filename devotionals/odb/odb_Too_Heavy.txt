Too Heavy

Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. —
Matthew 11:28

Today's Scripture: Psalm 32:1-6; Matthew 11:28-30

As I started up my car in the dark hours of early morning, I noticed a
seatbelt light on the dashboard. I checked my door, opening and
pulling it shut again. I tugged on my seatbelt to test it. But the
sensor light still beamed. Then, in slow realization, I reached over
and lifted my purse a few inches above the passenger seat. The light
clicked off.

Apparently, a cell phone, three rolls of quarters, a hardcover book,
and my lunch stuffed in my very large purse had equaled the weight of
a small passenger, thus setting off the sensor!

While I can easily empty out a handbag, other weights are not so easy
to shed. Those burdens of life involve a heaviness of spirit.

Whether the burden that weighs us down is one of guilt such as the one
that consumed David’s thoughts (Ps. 32:1-6), the fear Peter
experienced (Matt. 26:20-35), or the doubt Thomas carried (John
20:24-29), Jesus has invited us to bring them all to Him: “Come to Me,
all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”
(Matt. 11:28).

We are not built to bear burdens alone. When we cast them on the One
who wants to bear our burdens (Ps. 68:19; 1 Peter 5:7), He replaces
them with forgiveness, healing, and restoration. No burden is too
heavy for Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for lovingly carrying our burdens. In times of
trouble, help us to leave those burdens in Your strong hands and to
find our rest in You. In Jesus’ name, amen.

Burden God with what burdens you.
