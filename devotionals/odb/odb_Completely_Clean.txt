Completely Clean

It is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away
sins. —
Hebrews 10:4

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 10:1-18

Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me-ee.
Happy birthday to me. . . . Happy bir . . .

After humming the “birthday song” a second time, I turned off the
faucet’s running water. It is said that singing the song through twice
while washing your hands (about 20 seconds) is a good way to remove
most bacteria. But it doesn’t last. I need to repeat this process each
time they are contaminated.

In the Old Testament, the people of God offered sacrifices over and
over to cover their sins. But the blood of the animals didn’t actually
“take away sins” (Heb. 10:11). Only the precious sacrifice of Jesus
could do that!

Animal sacrifices are no longer needed because Christ’s sacrifice
. . .

• was once for all—unlike animal sacrifices, which had to be offered
“continually year by year” (vv.1-3,10).

• cleanses us completely from all guilt and sin—unlike the blood of
animals that was a reminder of sin’s penalty and could never take away
our sins (vv.3-6,11).

“By one offering [Christ] has perfected forever those who are being
sanctified” (v.14). Only through Jesus can we be declared completely
clean.

Reflect & Pray

Once for all, O sinner, receive it; Once for all, O brother, believe
it; Cling to the cross, the burden will fall, Christ hath redeemed us
once for all. —Bliss

Christ’s cleansing power can remove the most stubborn stain of sin.
