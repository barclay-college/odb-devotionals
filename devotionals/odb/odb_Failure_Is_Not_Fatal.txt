Failure Is Not Fatal

You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. —
John 6:69

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 18:15-27

Prime Minister Winston Churchill knew how to bolster the spirits of
the British people during World War II. On June 18, 1940, he told a
frightened populace, “Hitler knows that he will have to break us . . .
or lose the war. . . . Let us therefore brace . . . and so bear
ourselves that, if the British Empire [lasts] for a thousand years,
men will still say, ‘This was their finest hour!’ ”

We would all like to be remembered for our “finest hour.” Perhaps the
apostle Peter’s finest hour was when he proclaimed, “You are the
Christ, the Son of the living God” (John 6:69). Sometimes, however, we
let our failures define us. After Peter repeatedly denied that he knew
Jesus, he went out and wept bitterly (Matt. 26:75; John 18).

Like Peter, we all fall short—in our relationships, in our struggle
with sin, in our faithfulness to God. But “failure is not fatal,” as
Churchill also said. Thankfully, this is true in our spiritual life.
Jesus forgave the repentant Peter for his failure (John 21) and used
him to preach and lead many to the Savior.

Failure is not fatal. God lovingly restores those who turn back to
Him.
