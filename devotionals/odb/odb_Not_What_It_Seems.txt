Not What It Seems

Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they
are from God.
1 John 4:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 19:29–37

“Listen!” my wife said to me over the phone. “There’s a monkey in our
yard!” She held up the phone so I could hear. And yes, it sounded just
like a monkey. Which is weird, because the nearest wild monkey was
2,000 miles away.

Later, my father-in-law burst our bubble. “That’s a barred owl,” he
explained. Reality was not what it had seemed.

When King Sennacherib’s armies had Judah’s King Hezekiah trapped
inside Jerusalem’s walls, the Assyrians thought victory was theirs.
Reality proved different. Although the Assyrian field commander used
smooth words and pretended to speak for God, the Lord had His hand on
His people.

“Have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the
Lord ?” the commander asked (2 Kings 18:25). As he tried to entice
Jerusalem to surrender, he even said, “Choose life and not death!” (v.
32).

That sounds like something God would say. But the prophet Isaiah told
the Israelites the true words of the Lord. “[Sennacherib] will not
enter this city or shoot an arrow here,” God said. “I will defend this
city and save it” (19:32–34; Isaiah 37:35). That very night “the angel
of the Lord ” destroyed the Assyrians (v. 35).

From time to time, we’ll encounter smooth-talking people who “advise”
us while denying God’s power. That isn’t God’s voice. He speaks to us
through His Word. He guides us with His Spirit. His hand is on those
who follow Him, and He will never abandon us.
