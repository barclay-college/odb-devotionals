Disaster Diaries

His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your
faithfulness. —
Lamentations 3:22-23

Today's Scripture: Lamentations 3:19-33

Yves Congar was just 10 years old when World War I began and the
French town where he lived was invaded by the German army. His mother
encouraged him to keep a diary, and what resulted was a lucid
description of a military occupation, complete with written narrative
and colored sketches. His diary recorded a disaster from a child’s
perspective. What he witnessed had such a profound effect on him that
he felt called to bring others the hope of Christ.

Centuries earlier the prophet Jeremiah was an eyewitness to the
invasion of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. He wrote down his
observations in his “diary”—the book of Lamentations. Despite these
distressing times, the prophet found hope in the heart of God. He
wrote: “Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His
compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your
faithfulness” (3:22-23).

At various times, we may experience or witness disasters that feel
like hostile forces entering our lives. But these times of trouble do
not last forever. And, like Jeremiah, our most sustaining hope is to
reflect upon the faithfulness and provision of our heavenly Father.
The Lord’s compassions are new every morning, and His faithfulness is
great!
