Still Bearing Fruit

By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit. —
John 15:8

Today's Scripture: John 15:8-17

Sometimes the harvest comes late. Sometimes you sow seeds of hope
without really knowing it. Sometimes the fruit of your life comes in a
way and time you would never expect.

My daughter Melissa had accepted God’s gift of salvation at a young
age. But she never saw herself as some great Christian who could
change lives. She was just a high school junior trying to cope with a
job, school, and sports while balancing friendships—just a kid trying
to live as God would want her to.

Yet, in 2002 when He welcomed her into heaven when she was just 17,
her faith in Christ and her faithful life stood on their own. No
advance warning. No time to make things right with others. No new
opportunities to “bear much fruit” (John 15:8).

Melissa tried to live in a way that was pleasing to God—and her life
is still bearing fruit. Just recently, I heard of a young person who
trusted Jesus as Savior at a sports camp after a coach shared
Melissa’s story.

All of us are writing a story with our lives—one that affects others
now and in the future. Are we living to please God? We don’t know when
the Lord will call us Home. Let’s live every day with an eye on the
harvest.

Reflect & Pray

Only the truth that in life we have spoken, Only the seed that on
earth we have sown; These shall pass onward when we are forgotten,
Fruits of the harvest and what we have done. —Bonar

A fruitful harvest requires a faithful life.
