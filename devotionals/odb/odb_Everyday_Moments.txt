Everyday Moments

A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the
spirit.
Proverbs 15:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 15:13–15

I piled groceries in my car and carefully exited my parking spot.
Suddenly a man darted across the pavement just in front of me, not
noticing my approach. I slammed on my brakes, just missing him.
Startled, he looked up and met my gaze. In that moment, I knew I had a
choice: respond with rolled-eye frustration or offer a smiling
forgiveness. I smiled.

Relief flickered across his face, raising the edges of his own lips in
gratefulness.

Proverbs 15:13 says, “A happy heart makes the face cheerful, but
heartache crushes the spirit.” Is the writer directing us to cheery
grins in the face of every interruption, disappointment, and
inconvenience life brings? Surely not! There are times for genuine
mourning, despair, and even anger at injustice. But in our everyday
moments, a smile can offer relief, hope, and the grace needed to
continue.

Perhaps the point of the proverb is that a smile naturally results
from the condition of our inner beings. A “happy heart” is at peace,
content, and yielded to God’s best. With such a heart, happy from the
inside out, we can respond to surprising circumstances with a genuine
smile, inviting others to embrace the hope and peace they too can
experience with God.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, today as I cross paths with others around me, make my
heart happy that I may share with them the hope only You can offer.

Encourage one another and build each other up. 1 Thessalonians 5:11
