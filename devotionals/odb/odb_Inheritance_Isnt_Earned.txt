Inheritance Isn’t Earned

He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in
accordance with his pleasure and will.
Ephesians 1:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 1:3–14

“Thanks for dinner, Dad,” I said as I set my napkin on the restaurant
table. I was home on a break from college and, after being gone for a
while, it felt strange to have my parents pay for me. “You’re welcome,
Julie,” my dad replied, “but you don’t have to thank me for everything
all the time. I know you’ve been off on your own, but you’re still my
daughter and a part of the family.” I smiled. “Thanks, Dad.”

In my family, I haven’t done anything to earn my parents’ love or what
they do for me. But my dad’s comment reminds me that I haven’t done
anything to deserve to be a part of God’s family either.

In the book of Ephesians, Paul tells his readers that God chose them
“to be holy and blameless in his sight” (1:4), or to stand without
blemish before Him (5:25–27). But this is only possible through Jesus,
in whom “we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace” (1:7). We don’t
have to earn God’s grace, forgiveness, or entrance into His family. We
simply accept His free gift.

When we turn our lives over to Jesus, we become children of God, which
means we receive eternal life and have an inheritance waiting for us
in heaven. Praise God for offering such a wonderful gift!

Reflect & Pray

In what ways do you feel or act as if you have to earn God’s love? How
can you practice living in the freedom of His love?

Faithful God, thank You for freely giving Your Son so I can be a part
of Your family. Help me to honor You in all You’ve done for me.
