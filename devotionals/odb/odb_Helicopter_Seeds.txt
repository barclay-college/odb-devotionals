Helicopter Seeds

Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only
a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
John 12:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 12:23–33

When our children were young, they loved trying to catch the
“helicopter seeds” that fell from our neighbor’s silver maple trees.
Each seed resembles a wing. In late spring they twirl to the ground
like a helicopter’s rotor blades. The seeds’ purpose is not to fly,
but to fall to earth and grow into trees.

Before Jesus was crucified, He told His followers, “The hour has come
for the Son of Man to be glorified. . . . [U]nless a kernel of wheat
falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it
dies, it produces many seeds” (John 12:23–24).

While Jesus’s disciples wanted Him to be honored as the Messiah, He
came to give His life so we could be forgiven and transformed through
faith in Him.  As Jesus’s followers, we hear His words, “Anyone who
loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in
this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must
follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will
honor the one who serves me” (vv. 25–26).

Helicopter seeds can point us to the miracle of Jesus, the Savior, who
died that we might live for Him.
