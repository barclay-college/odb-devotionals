Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good
way is, and walk in it; then you will find rest for your souls. —
Jeremiah 6:16

Today's Scripture: Jeremiah 6:14-20

If you’ve ever tried to fix something and failed, you’ll appreciate
the sign I saw outside an automotive repair shop: We Will Fix What
Your Husband Fixed. Whether the problem is the car, the plumbing, or
an appliance, it’s usually better off in the hands of someone who is
skilled and trustworthy.

So it is with the sin and the struggles within us that resist our
efforts to mend them.

Jeremiah denounced the greedy prophets and priests of his day who
“healed the hurt of [God’s] people slightly, saying ‘Peace, peace!’
when there is no peace” (Jer. 6:14). They could neither change
themselves nor lead the people to spiritual transformation. So the
Lord called the people to follow His way: “Stand in the ways and see,
and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then
you will find rest for your souls” (v.16).

Centuries later, Jesus, the Son of God, said: “Come to Me, all you who
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28).

The parts of our lives that we have tried and failed to repair can be
restored by the hand of God. Through faith in Christ, we can be made
whole.
