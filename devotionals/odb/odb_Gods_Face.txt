God’s Face

For God . . . made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light
of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ.
2 Corinthians 4:6

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 4:4–15

Much of my career as a writer has revolved around the problem of pain.
I return again and again to the same questions, as if fingering an old
wound that never quite heals. I hear from readers of my books, and
their anguished stories give human faces to my doubts. I remember a
youth pastor calling me after he had learned that his wife and baby
daughter were dying of AIDS because of a tainted blood transfusion.
“How can I talk to my youth group about a loving God?” he asked.

I have learned to not even attempt an answer to these “why” questions.
Why did the youth pastor’s wife happen to get the one tainted bottle
of blood? Why does a tornado hit one town and skip over another? Why
do prayers for physical healing go unanswered?

One question, however, no longer gnaws at me as it once did: “Does God
care?” I know of only one way to answer that question, and the answer
is Jesus. In Jesus, God gave us a face. If you wonder how God feels
about the suffering on this groaning planet, look at that face.

“Does God care?” His Son’s death on our behalf, which will ultimately
destroy all pain, sorrow, suffering, and death for eternity, answers
that question. “For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’
made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the
knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ” (2 Cor.
4:6).
