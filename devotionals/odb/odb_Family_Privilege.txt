Family Privilege

As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children
of God.
John 1:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 1:6-14

When I was in primary school in Ghana, I had to live with a loving and
caring family away from my parents. One day, all the children
assembled for a special family meeting. The first part involved all of
us sharing individual experiences. But next, when only “blood
children” were required to be present, I was politely excluded. Then
the stark reality hit me: I was not a “child of the house.” Despite
their love for me, the family required that I should be excused
because I was only living with them; I was not a legal part of their
family.

This incident reminds me of John 1:11-12. The Son of God came to His
own people and they rejected Him. Those who received Him then, and
receive Him now, are given the right to become God’s children. When we
are adopted into His family, “the Spirit Himself bears witness with
our spirit that we are children of God” (Rom. 8:16).

Jesus doesn’t exclude anybody who is adopted by the Father. Rather, He
welcomes us as a permanent part of His family. “As many as received
Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who
believe in His name” (John 1:12).

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, for making it possible for me to be Your child. I’m
grateful to be Yours and not to have to worry about whether You will
remove me from Your family. I am Yours and You are mine.

Assurance of salvation is not in what you know but who you know.
