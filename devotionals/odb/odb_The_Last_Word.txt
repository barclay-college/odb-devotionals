The Last Word

Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart.
Ecclesiastes 5:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 5:1–7

One day during a university philosophy class, a student made some
inflammatory remarks about the professor’s views. To the surprise of
the other students, the teacher thanked him and moved on to another
comment. When he was asked later why he didn’t respond to the student,
he said, “I’m practicing the discipline of not having to have the last
word.”

This teacher loved and honored God, and he wanted to embody a humble
spirit as he reflected this love. His words remind me of another
Teacher—this one from long ago, who wrote the book of Ecclesiastes.
Although not addressing how to handle an angry person, he said that
when we approach the Lord we should guard our steps and “go near to
listen” rather than being quick with our mouths and hasty in our
hearts. By doing so we acknowledge that God is the Lord and we are
those whom He has created (Ecclesiastes 5:1–2).

How do you approach God? If you sense that your attitude could use
some adjustment, why not spend some time considering the majesty and
greatness of the Lord? When we ponder His unending wisdom, power, and
presence, we can feel awed by His overflowing love for us. With this
posture of humility, we too need not have the last word.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, I want to honor You and I bow before You now in silence.
Teach me how to pray and how to listen.

Carefully chosen words honor God.
