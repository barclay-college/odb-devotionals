Heat And Holiness

When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned. —
Isaiah 43:2

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 43:1-13

Why is it taking my hair so long to get dry? I wondered. As usual, I
was in a hurry, and I didn’t want to go outside into the wintry
weather with wet hair. Then I realized the problem. I had changed the
setting on the hairdryer to “warm” instead of “hot” to accommodate my
niece’s preferences.

I often wish I could control the conditions of life as easily as I can
change the setting on my hairdryer. I would choose a comfortable
setting—not too hot, not too cold. I certainly wouldn’t choose the
heat of adversity or the fire of affliction. But in the spiritual
realm, warm doesn’t get the job done. We are called to holiness, and
holiness often involves “heat.” To be holy means to be set apart for
God—separated from anything unclean or impure. To refine and purify
us, God sometimes uses the furnace of affliction. The prophet Isaiah
said, “When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned” (Isa.
43:2); he didn’t say if. And the apostle Peter said that we should not
be surprised by trials (1 Peter 4:12).

None of us knows when we’ll be called to walk through the fire or how
hot the furnace will be. But we do know this: God’s purpose for the
flames is to purify us, not to destroy us.

Reflect & Pray

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, My grace, all-
sufficient, shall be thy supply. The flames shall not hurt thee; I
only design Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine. —Keen

The only way God hurries holiness is by turning up the heat.
