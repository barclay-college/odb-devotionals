Keepers of the Light

For God . . . made his light shine in our hearts.
2 Corinthians 4:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 8:12–16

They call them “Keepers of the Light.”

At the lighthouse on the cape of Hatteras Island just off the North
Carolina coast of the United States, there’s a memorial to those
who’ve tended the light stations there since 1803. Shortly after the
existing structure was moved inland because of shoreline erosion, the
names of the keepers were etched on the old foundation stones and
arranged into an amphitheater shape facing the new site. That way—as a
placard explains—today’s visitors can follow in the historical
keepers’ footsteps and “watch over” the lighthouse as well.

Jesus is the ultimate light-giver. He said, “I am the light of the
world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have
the light of life” (John 8:12). That’s a radical thing for anyone to
claim. But Jesus said it to affirm His relationship with His heavenly
Father, the Creator of light and life who sent Him.

When we look to Jesus for salvation and follow His teaching, we’re
restored in relationship with God, and He gives us new power and
purpose. His transforming life and love—“the light of all mankind”
(1:4)—shines in us and through us and out to a dark and sometimes
dangerous world.

As believers in Jesus, we become “keepers of the light.” May others
see His light shine from us and discover the life and hope He alone
can give!

Reflect & Pray

In what practical ways can you shine Jesus’ light? Where is God
calling you to be obedient to Him today?

Jesus, I praise You for Your light and love. Help me to shine for You.
