I’m Alive

You He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins. —
Ephesians 2:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:1-10

Laura Brooks, a 52-year-old mother of two, didn’t know it but she was
one of 14,000 people in 2011 whose name was incorrectly entered into
the government database as dead. She wondered what was wrong when she
stopped receiving disability checks, and her loan payments and her
rent checks bounced. She went to the bank to clear up the issue, but
the representative told her that her accounts had been closed because
she was dead! Obviously, they were mistaken.

The apostle Paul was not mistaken when he said that the Ephesian
believers were at one point dead—spiritually dead. They were dead in
the sense that they were separated from God, enslaved to sin (Eph.
2:5), and condemned under the wrath of God. What a state of
hopelessness!

Yet God in His goodness took action to reverse this condition for them
and for us. The living God “who gives life to the dead” (Rom. 4:17)
poured out His rich mercy and great love by sending His Son Jesus to
this earth. Through Christ’s death and resurrection, we are made alive
(Eph. 2:4-5).

When we believe in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, we go
from death to life. Now we live to rejoice in His goodness!

Reflect & Pray

I know I’m a sinner and Christ is my need; His death is my ransom, no
merit I plead. His work is sufficient, on Him I believe; I have life
eternal when Him I receive. —Anon.

Accepting Jesus’ death gives me life.
