A Serving Leader

Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant. Matthew
20:26
Matthew 20:26

Today's Scripture: 1 Kings 12:1-15

In traditional African societies, leadership succession is a serious
decision. After a king’s demise, great care is taken selecting the
next ruler. Besides being from a royal family, the successor must be
strong, fearless, and sensible. Candidates are questioned to determine
if they will serve the people or rule with a heavy hand. The king’s
successor needs to be someone who leads but also serves.

Even though Solomon made his own bad choices, he worried over his
successor. “Who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet
they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have
poured my effort and skill” (Eccl. 2:19). His son Rehoboam was that
successor. He demonstrated a lack of sound judgment and ended up
fulfilling his father’s worst fear.

When the people requested more humane working conditions, it was an
opportunity for Rehoboam to show servant leadership. “If today you
will be a servant to these people and serve them . . . ,” the elders
advised, “they will always be your servants” (1 Kings 12:7). But he
rejected their counsel. Rehoboam failed to seek God. His harsh
response to the people divided the kingdom and accelerated the
spiritual decline of God’s people (12:14-19).

In the family, the workplace, at church, or in our neighborhood—we
need His wisdom for the humility to serve rather than be served.
