Sweet Rest

You have put gladness in my heart. —
Psalm 4:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 4

Try as we might—tossing, turning, fluffing the pillow, pounding the
pillow—sometimes we just can’t fall asleep. After offering some good
suggestions on how to get a better night’s sleep, a news article
concluded that there really is no “right way” to sleep.

There are numerous reasons why sleep eludes us, many of which we can’t
do much about. But sometimes unwanted wakefulness is caused by anxious
thoughts, worry, or guilt. It’s then that the example of David in
Psalm 4 can help. He called out to God, asking for mercy and for God
to hear his prayer (v.1). He also reminded himself that the Lord does
hear him when he calls on Him (v.3). David encourages us: “Meditate
within your heart on your bed, and be still” (v.4). Focusing our minds
on the goodness, mercy, and love of God for His world, our loved ones,
and ourselves can aid us in trusting the Lord (v.5).

The Lord desires to help us set aside our worries about finding
solutions to our problems and place our trust in Him to work things
out. He can “put gladness” in our hearts (v.7), so that we might “lie
down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, O Lord, make [us] dwell in
safety” (v.8).

Reflect & Pray

Give me a spirit of peace, dear Lord, Midst the storms and the
tempests that roll, That I may find rest and quiet within, A calm
buried deep in my soul. —Dawe

Even when we cannot sleep, God can give us rest.
