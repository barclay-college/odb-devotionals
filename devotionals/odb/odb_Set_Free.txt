Set Free

Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ
Jesus.
Romans 8:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:1–2, 15–17

When I was a boy in the village, something about chickens fascinated
me. Whenever I caught one, I held it down for a few moments and then
gently released it. Thinking I was still holding it, the chicken
remained down; even though it was free to dash away, it felt trapped.

When we put our faith in Jesus, He graciously delivers us from sin and
the hold that Satan had on us. However, because it may take time to
change our sinful habits and behavior, Satan can make us feel trapped.
But God’s Spirit has set us free; He doesn’t enslave us. Paul told the
Romans, “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who
gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death” (Romans
8:1–2).

Through our Bible reading, prayer, and the power of the Holy Spirit,
God works in us to cleanse us and to help us live for Him. The Bible
encourages us to be confident in our walk with Jesus without feeling
as if we are not set free.

Jesus said, “If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed” (John
8:36). May the freedom we have in Christ spur us on to love Him and
serve Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, forgive me for sometimes revisiting my past and forgetting that
You have washed away my sins. Thank You for taking my burden and
setting me free to enjoy living for You.

My chains fell off, my heart was free, I rose, went forth, and
followed Thee. Charles Wesley
