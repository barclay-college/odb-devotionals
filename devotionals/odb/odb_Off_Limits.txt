Off-Limits

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that
whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. —
John 3:16

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:1-8

As a 12-year-old, I was curious about the Bible my dad was given when
he retired from the paper mill. It came in a special cedar box marked
The Holy Bible, and I assumed that “holy” meant it was off-limits to
me. But still I peered inside. In the center of the Bible was a
picture of Jesus hanging on the cross, along with the words of John
3:16. There was also a see-through red film covering the page, which I
assumed meant He bled and died.

Occasionally, when no one else was looking, I would gently pull the
holy Book off the shelf, open the box, look at the picture of Jesus on
the cross, read the verse, and wonder about this Man and why He died.
I wondered if His love was meant for me or if it too was off-limits.

Several years later I heard a message about how God had provided
access to His love through Jesus. Romans 5:1-2 tells us: “We have
peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we
have access by faith into this grace in which we stand.” I believed
and received Jesus’ salvation from my sin.

Aren’t you thankful that the Bible and God’s love aren’t off-limits?
Receive His forgiveness—it’s meant for unholy people like you and me.

How precious is God’s holy Word— Its pages every one! They lead us to
the Living Word— To Jesus, God’s dear Son. —D. De Haan

The Bible is God’s love letter to us.
