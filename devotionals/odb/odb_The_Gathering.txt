The Gathering

The Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd [us] and lead
[us] to living fountains of waters. —
Revelation 7:17

Today's Scripture: Revelation 7:9-17

During Oswald Chambers’ service as a YMCA chaplain in Egypt
(1915–1917), he touched the lives of many soldiers who died in World
War I. On November 6, 1916, Chambers wrote in his diary: “We have a
letter from a New Zealand friend telling us that Ted Strack has been
killed. And so Ted Strack has ‘gone to be with Jesus.’ That is just
how he would have put it . . . . [He] was a rough beauty of nature and
of grace, a fearless, loveable little saint. Thank God for every
remembrance of him . . . . So they are gathering one by one.”

As we grieve the death of those we love, we cling to Jesus’ promise of
life beyond the grave. The book of Revelation records John’s vision of
a great multitude from every nation, tribe, and language gathered
around God’s throne in heaven (7:9). The overarching truth of this
passage is a glad, eternal reunion when “the Lamb who is in the midst
of the throne will shepherd [us] and lead [us] to living fountains of
waters” (v.17).

The passing of every believer in Christ foreshadows the day when we
will join them with the Lord. In our sadness today, we are hopeful as
we see that “they are gathering one by one.”
