Light Up The Night

Those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament. —
Daniel 12:3

Today's Scripture: Daniel 12:1-3

On a mild fall evening when the sky was dark and the moon was full,
thousands of people in my hometown gathered along the banks of the
river to light sky lanterns. They released them into the darkness, and
watched as the lights rose to join the moon in a dazzling display that
turned the night sky into a sparkling work of art.

When I saw pictures of the event, I was disappointed that I was out of
town and had missed it. But a few days later I realized that what had
happened in Grand Rapids could be seen as a symbol of the conference I
was attending in New York City. More than 1,000 people from 100 cities
around the world had gathered there to plan a “work of art”—how to
light up the darkness of their own cities by planting churches and
reaching thousands of people with the gospel of Christ, the Light of
the world.

The prophet Daniel wrote about a time when those who turn others to
the Lord will shine like stars forever (Dan. 12:3). We can all join in
that great event. When we shine the light of Christ in dark places
where we live and work, He is lighting up the night sky with stars
that never will go out.

Reflect & Pray

I want to shine for You in my world, Lord. Show me how to lift You up,
the Light of the world. I look forward to that day when I will gather
with people from all nations to bow at Your feet and worship You.

When the Light of the world illuminates the earth, His beauty will
attract people from every nation.
