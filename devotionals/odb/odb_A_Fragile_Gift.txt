A Fragile Gift

Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
2 Corinthians 9:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:1-7

When we give a fragile gift, we make sure it is marked on the box that
contains it. The word fragile is written with big letters because we
don’t want anyone to damage what is inside.

God’s gift to us came in the most fragile package: a baby. Sometimes
we imagine Christmas day as a beautiful scene on a postcard, but any
mother can tell you it wasn’t so. Mary was tired, probably insecure.
It was her first child, and He was born in the most unsanitary
conditions. She “wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a
manger, because there was no room for them in the inn” (Luke 2:7
nkjv).

A baby needs constant care. Babies cry, eat, sleep, and depend on
their caregivers. They cannot make decisions. In Mary’s day, infant
mortality was high, and mothers often died in childbirth.

Why did God choose such a fragile way to send His Son to earth?
Because Jesus had to be like us in order to save us. God’s greatest
gift came in the fragile body of a baby, but God took the risk because
He loves us. Let us be thankful today for such a gift!

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, the Strong and Mighty One, I thank You for becoming small
and fragile on that day long ago. It amazes me that You did that for
me and the rest of Your world.

May you know the peace of Christmas every day of the year.
