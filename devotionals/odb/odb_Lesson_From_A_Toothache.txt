Lesson From A Toothache

If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons. —
Hebrews 12:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 12:3-11

“When I was a child I often had a toothache,” wrote C. S. Lewis in his
classic book Mere Christianity. He continued, “and I knew that if I
went to my mother she would give me something that would deaden the
pain for that night and let me get to sleep. But I did not go to my
mother—at least not till the pain became very bad. . . . I knew she
would take me to the dentist the next morning. . . .  I wanted
immediate relief from pain, but I could not get it without having my
teeth set permanently right.”

Similarly, we might not always want to go to God right away when we
have a problem or are struggling in a certain area. We know that He
could provide immediate relief from our pain, but He is more concerned
with dealing with the root of the problem. We may be afraid that He
will reveal issues that we are unprepared or unwilling to deal with.

In times like these, it is helpful to remind ourselves that the Lord
“deals with [us] as with sons” (Heb. 12:7). His discipline, though
perhaps painful, is wise, and His touch is loving. He loves us too
much to let us remain as we are; He wants to conform us to the
likeness of His Son, Jesus (Rom. 8:29). God’s purposes of love can be
trusted more than any of our emotions of fear.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for showing me my hidden faults, for You treat me as
Your dear child. Help me surrender to Your cleansing work till the
beauty of Jesus be seen in me.

God’s hand of discipline is a hand of love.
