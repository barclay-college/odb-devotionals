He Knows Our Names

Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you
are mine.
Isaiah 43:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 23:1–6

During a visit to the National September 11 Memorial in New York City,
I quickly photographed one of the twin reflecting pools. Around these
two pools, the names of the nearly 3,000 people who died in the World
Trade Center attacks are etched into bronze panels. Later, while
looking more closely at the photo, my eyes were drawn to the hand of a
woman resting on a name. Many people come to this place to touch a
name and remember someone they loved.

The prophet Isaiah reminded God’s people of His unfailing love and
concern for them, even though they had often turned away from Him. The
Lord said, “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you
by name; you are mine” (Isaiah 43:1).

In the 23rd Psalm, David wrote, “Even though I walk through the
darkest valley [the valley of the shadow of death], I will fear no
evil, for you are with me . . . . Surely your goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of
the L ord forever” (vv. 4, 6).

God never forgets us. No matter where we are or whatever our
situation, He knows our names and holds us fast in His unfailing love.

Father in heaven, thank You for calling us by name and surrounding us
