Living on Purpose

Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
1 Corinthians 10:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 12:9–21

“We’re going on vacation!” my wife enthusiastically told our three-
year-old grandson Austin as we pulled out of the driveway on the first
leg of our trip. Little Austin looked at her thoughtfully and
responded, “I’m not going on vacation. I’m going on a mission!”

We’re not sure where our grandson picked up the concept of going “on a
mission,” but his comment gave me something to ponder as we drove to
the airport: As I leave on this vacation and take a break for a few
days, am I keeping in mind that I’m still “on a mission” to live each
moment with and for God? Am I remembering to serve Him in everything I
do?

The apostle Paul encouraged the believers living in Rome, the capital
city of the Roman Empire, to “never be lacking in zeal, but keep your
spiritual fervor, serving the Lord” (Romans 12:11). His point was that
our life in Jesus is meant to be lived intentionally and with
enthusiasm. Even the most mundane moments gain new meaning as we look
expectantly to God and live for His purposes.

As we settled into our seats on the plane, I prayed, “Lord, I’m yours.
Whatever you have for me to do on this trip, please help me not to
miss it.”

Every day is a mission of eternal significance with Him!

Reflect & Pray

Have you ever been on a mission? How can you make life all about God?

Please give me grace to live for You, Jesus, so that I may one day
hear You say, “Well done, good and faithful servant!” (Matthew 25:23).
