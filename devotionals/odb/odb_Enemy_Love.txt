Enemy Love

If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
Luke 6:32

Today's Scripture: Jonah 3:10–4:11

When war broke out in 1950, fifteen-year-old Kim Chin-Kyung joined the
South Korean army to defend his homeland. He soon found, however, that
he wasn’t ready for the horrors of combat. As young friends died
around him, he begged God for his life and promised that, if allowed
to live, he would learn to love his enemies.

Sixty-five years later, Dr. Kim reflected on that answered prayer.
Through decades of caring for orphans and assisting in the education
of North Korean and Chinese young people, he has won many friends
among those he once regarded as enemies. Today he shuns political
labels. Instead he calls himself a loveist as an expression of his
faith in Jesus.

The prophet Jonah left a different kind of legacy. Even a dramatic
rescue from the belly of a big fish didn’t transform his heart.
Although he eventually obeyed God, Jonah said he’d rather die than
watch the Lord show mercy to his enemies (Jonah 4:1–2, 8).

We can only guess as to whether Jonah ever learned to care for the
people of Nineveh. Instead we are left to wonder about ourselves. Will
we settle for his attitude toward those we fear and hate? Or will we
ask God for the ability to love our enemies as He has shown mercy to
us?

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, like Your reluctant prophet, we are inclined to love
only those who love us. Yet You loved us even when we cared only for
ourselves. Please give us the grace to be more like Jesus than Jonah.

Love conquers all.
