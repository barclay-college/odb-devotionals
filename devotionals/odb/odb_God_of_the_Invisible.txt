God of the Invisible

God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have
shown him as you have helped his people.
Hebrews 6:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 1:35–42

“Sometimes I feel as if I’m invisible. But I so want God to use me.”

Ann was tidying up the exercise room at the hotel I was visiting when
we struck up a conversation. As we talked, I discovered she had an
amazing story.

“I used to be a crack addict and prostitute living on the streets,”
she said. “But I knew God wanted me to put down my pipe and walk with
Him. One day years ago I knelt at Jesus’ feet, and He set me free.”

I thanked Ann for sharing what God had done for her and assured her
she wasn’t invisible—He had used her in our conversation in a
beautiful way to remind me of His power to transform lives.

God loves to use people others might overlook. The apostle Andrew
isn’t as well known as his brother Peter, but the Bible recounts that
“the first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon [Peter] and
tell him, ‘We have found the Messiah’. . . . And he brought him to
Jesus” (John 1:41–42).

Peter met Jesus through Andrew. When Andrew, one of John the Baptist’s
disciples, learned about Jesus from John, he followed Jesus and
believed—and immediately told his brother. Andrew’s quiet faithfulness
had an impact that would shake the world.

God values faithful service over fame. He can use us powerfully
wherever we are—even when no one is looking.

Whose quiet faithfulness made a difference in your life? How can you

Thank You for never overlooking me, Father! I’m thankful You can use
me to make a difference wherever I am.
