God’s Compass

Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.
Psalm 119:105

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:105-112

During World War II, small compasses saved the lives of 27 sailors 300
miles off the coast of North Carolina. Waldemar Semenov, a retired
merchant seaman, was serving as a junior engineer aboard the SS Alcoa
Guide when a German submarine surfaced and opened fire on the ship.
The ship was hit, caught fire, and began to sink. Semenov and his crew
lowered compass-equipped lifeboats into the water and used the
compasses to guide them toward the shipping lanes closer to shore.
After three days, the men were rescued.

The psalmist reminded God’s people that His Word was a trustworthy
“compass.” He likened it to a lamp. In that day, the flickering light
cast by an olive oil lamp was only bright enough to show a traveler
his next step. To the psalmist, God’s Word was such a lamp, providing
enough light to illuminate the path for those pursuing God (Ps.
119:105). When the psalmist was wandering in the dark on a chaotic
path of life, he believed that God, through the guidance of His Word,
would provide direction.

When we lose our bearings in life, we can trust our God who gives His
trustworthy Word as our compass, using it to lead us into deeper
fellowship with Him.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, it is difficult to navigate life. I drift sometimes,
but I will trust in You. Lead me and guide me by the faithfulness and
reliability of Your Word.

God has given us His Word to help us know and follow Him.
