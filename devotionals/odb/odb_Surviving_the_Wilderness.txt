Surviving the Wilderness

The message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not
share the faith of those who obeyed.
Hebrews 4:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 17:1–7

In the 1960s, the Kingston Trio released a song called “Desert Pete.”
The ballad tells of a thirsty cowboy who is crossing the desert and
finds a hand pump. Next to it, Desert Pete has left a note urging the
reader not to drink the water in the jar left there but to use its
contents to prime the pump.

The cowboy resists the temptation to drink and uses the water as the
note instructs. In reward for his obedience, he receives an abundance
of cold, satisfying water. Had he not acted in faith, he would have
had only a jar of unsatisfying, warm water to drink.

This reminds me of Israel’s journey through the wilderness. When their
thirst became overwhelming (Ex. 17:1–7), Moses sought the Lord. He was
told to strike the rock of Horeb with his staff. Moses believed and
obeyed, and water gushed from the stone.

Sadly, Israel would not consistently follow Moses’s example of faith.
Ultimately, “the message they heard was of no value to them, because
they did not share the faith of those who obeyed” (Heb. 4:2).

Sometimes life can seem like an arid desert. But God can quench our
spiritual thirst in the most unlikely circumstances. When by faith we
believe the promises of God’s Word, we can experience rivers of living
water and grace for our daily needs.
