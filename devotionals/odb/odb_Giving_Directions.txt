Giving Directions

I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father
except through Me. —
John 14:6

Today's Scripture: Matthew 28:16-20

Not long ago my wife’s car needed to be towed. When I explained to the
man at the towing company how to find our home, I instructed him to
tell the driver not to follow his global positioning system (GPS).
Because another street with the same name as ours was separated from
our home address by a field, special instructions were necessary. He
assured me he would pass on my directions.

As I stood in the driveway wondering where the tow truck was, the
driver called and said he had followed his GPS but couldn’t find my
street number. Hmmmm. I repeated the directions I had given before,
and the tow truck was there in no time.

Christians have a responsibility to give accurate directions for how a
person can get to heaven by having a relationship with Christ (see
John 3:16; 1 Cor. 15:1-5). We need to help people see that following
their own religious “global positioning system,” such as good works or
hoping to be good enough, won’t get them to heaven. While being
sensitive to people’s beliefs, we need to share the true gospel of the
death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.

Jesus said it best, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one
comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6).

Reflect & Pray

Father, as we interact with others, may our lives and words show Your
loving grace. You’ve told us that Jesus is the way of salvation. Help
us to share the gospel with love and truth.

Salvation is achieved by Christ’s atonement, not by our attainment.
