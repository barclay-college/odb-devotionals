Spreading Joy

The angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that
will cause great joy for all the people.”
Luke 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 16:16–24

When Janet went to teach English in a school overseas, she found the
atmosphere gloomy and depressing. People did their jobs, but no one
seemed happy. They didn’t help or encourage one another. But Janet,
grateful for all that God had done for her, expressed it in everything
she did. She smiled. She was friendly. She went out of her way to help
people. She hummed songs and hymns.

Little by little, as Janet shared her joy, the atmosphere at the
school changed. One by one people began to smile and help each other.
When a visiting administrator asked the principal why his school was
so different, the principal, who was not a believer, responded, “Jesus
brings joy.” Janet was filled to overflowing with the joy of the Lord
and it spilled over to those around her.

The gospel of Luke tells us that God sent an angel to ordinary
shepherds to deliver an extraordinary birth announcement. The angel
made the surprising proclamation that the newborn baby “will cause
great joy for all the people” (Luke 2:10), which indeed He did.

Since then this message has spread through the centuries to us, and
now we are Christ’s messengers of joy to the world. Through the
indwelling of the Holy Spirit, we continue the practice of spreading
the joy of Jesus as we follow His example and serve others.
