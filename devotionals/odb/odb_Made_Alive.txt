Made Alive

You were dead in your transgressions and sins.
Ephesians 2:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:1–10

As a young man, my dad was traveling with a group of friends to an
out-of-town sporting event when the tires of their car slipped on the
rain-soaked roads. They had an accident—a bad accident. One of his
friends was paralyzed and another was killed. My dad was declared dead
and taken to the morgue. His shocked and grief-stricken parents came
to identify him. But my dad revived from what turned out to be a deep
coma. Their mourning turned to joy.

In Ephesians 2, the apostle Paul reminds us that apart from Christ we
are “dead in [our] transgressions and sins” (v. 1). But because of His
great love for us, “God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with
Christ even when we were dead in transgressions” (vv. 4–5). Through
Christ we have been brought from death to life.

So in every sense, we all owe our life to the Father in heaven.
Through His great love, He has made it possible for those of us who
were dead in sin to have life and purpose through His Son.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, for love that conquers sin, life that conquers
death, and grace that has conquered my heart. May my life be a sweet
aroma of praise to You.

We owed a debt we could not pay, but Jesus paid the debt He did not
owe.
