A Clear Conscience

I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God
and men. —
Acts 24:16

Today's Scripture: 1 John 1

After Ffyona Campbell became famous as the first woman to walk around
the world, her joy was short-lived. Despite the adulation she
received, something troubled her. Guilt overtook her and pushed her to
the brink of a nervous breakdown.

What was bothering her? “I shouldn’t be remembered as the first woman
to walk around the world,” she finally admitted. “I cheated.” During
her worldwide trek, she broke the guidelines of the Guinness Book of
World Records by riding in a truck part of the way. To clear her
conscience, she called her sponsor and confessed her deception.

God has given each of us a conscience that brings guilt when we do
wrong. In Romans, Paul describes our conscience as “accusing or else
excusing [us]” (2:15). For the obedient follower of Christ, care of
the conscience is an important way of maintaining a moral compass
despite moral imperfection. Confessing sin, turning from it, and
making restitution should be a way of life (1 John 1:9; Lev. 6:2-5).

Paul modeled a well-maintained conscience, saying, “I strive always to
keep my conscience clear before God and man” (Acts 24:16 NIV). Through
confession and repentance, he kept short accounts with God. Is sin
bothering you? Follow Paul’s example. Strive for a clear conscience.

Reflect & Pray

There is a treasure you can own That’s greater than a crown or throne:
This treasure is a conscience clear That brings the sweetest peace and
cheer. —Isenhour

If God’s Word guides your conscience, let your conscience be your
guide.
