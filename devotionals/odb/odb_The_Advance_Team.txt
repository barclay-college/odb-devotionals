My Father’s house has many rooms; . . . I am going there to prepare a
place for you.
John 14:2

Today's Scripture: John 14:1–14

A friend recently prepared to relocate to a city more than 1,000 miles
from her current hometown. She and her husband divided the labor of
moving to accommodate a short timeline. He secured new living
arrangements, while she packed their belongings. I was astounded by
her ability to move without previewing the area or participating in
the house hunt, and asked how she could do so. She acknowledged the
challenge but said she knew she could trust her husband because of his
attention to her preferences and needs over their years together.

In the upper room, Jesus spoke with His disciples of His coming
betrayal and death. The darkest hours of Jesus’s earthly life, and
that of the disciples as well, lay ahead. He comforted them with the
assurance that He would prepare a place for them in heaven, just as my
friend’s husband prepared a new home for their family. When
the disciples questioned Jesus, He pointed them to their mutual
history and the miracles they’d witnessed Him perform. Though they
would grieve Jesus’s death and absence, He reminded them He could be
counted on to do as He’d said.

Even in the midst of our own dark hours, we can trust Him to lead us
forward to a place of goodness. As we walk with Him, we too will learn
to trust increasingly in His faithfulness.
