What on Earth?

My God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory
in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 17:24–27

When Andrew Cheatle lost his cell phone at the beach, he thought it
was gone forever. About a week later, however, fisherman Glen Kerley
called him. He had pulled Cheatle’s phone, still functional after it
dried, out of a 25-pound cod.

Life is full of odd stories, and we find more than a few of them in
the Bible. One day tax collectors came to Peter demanding to know,
“Doesn’t your teacher pay the temple tax?” (Matt. 17:24). Jesus turned
the situation into a teaching moment. He wanted Peter to understand
His role as king. Taxes weren’t collected from the children of the
king, and the Lord made it clear that neither He nor His children owed
any temple tax (vv. 25–26).

Yet Jesus wanted to be careful not to “cause offense” (v. 27), so He
told Peter to go fishing. (This is the odd part of the story.) Peter
found a coin in the mouth of the first fish he caught.

What on earth is Jesus doing here? A better question is, “What in
God’s kingdom is Jesus doing?” He is the rightful King—even when many
do not recognize Him as such. When we accept His role as Lord in our
lives, we become His children.

Life will still throw its various demands at us, but Jesus will
provide for us. As former pastor David Pompo put it, “When we’re
fishing for our Father, we can depend on Him for all we need.”

Reflect & Pray

Lord, teach us to bask in the wonderful realization that You provide
everything we need.

We are children of the King!
