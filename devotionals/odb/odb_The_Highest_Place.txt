The Highest Place

He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
Colossians 1:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:15–23

My husband invited a friend to church. After the service his friend
said, “I liked the songs and the atmosphere, but I don’t get it. Why
do you give Jesus such a high place of honor?” My husband then
explained to him that Christianity is a relationship with Christ.
Without Him, Christianity would be meaningless. It’s because of what
Jesus has done in our lives that we meet together and praise Him.

Who is Jesus and what has He done? The apostle Paul answered this
question in Colossians 1. No one has seen God, but Jesus came to
reflect and reveal Him (v. 15). Jesus, as the Son of God, came to die
for us and free us from sin. Sin has separated us from God’s holiness,
so peace could only be made through someone perfect. That was Jesus
(vv. 14, 20). In other words, Jesus has given us what no one else
could—access to God and eternal life (John 17:3).

Why does He deserve such a place of honor? He conquered death. He won
our hearts by His love and sacrifice. He gives us new strength every
day. He is everything to us!

We give Him the glory because He deserves it. We lift Him up because
that is His rightful place. Let’s give Him the highest place in our
hearts.
