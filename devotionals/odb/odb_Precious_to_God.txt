Precious to God

Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one
another.
1 John 4:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 1:26–31

His name was David, but most just called him “the street fiddler.”
David was a disheveled, older man who was a regular fixture in popular
places in our city, serenading passers-by with unusual skill at his
violin. In exchange for his music, listeners would sometimes place a
dollar in the open instrument case before them on the sidewalk. David
would smile and nod his head in thanks as he continued to play.

When David died recently and his obituary appeared in a local paper,
it was revealed that he spoke several languages, was the graduate of a
prestigious university, and had even run for the state senate years
ago. Some expressed surprise at the extent of his accomplishments,
having assessed him on the basis of appearance alone.

Scripture tells us that “God created mankind in his own image”
(Genesis 1:27). This reveals an inherent worth within each of us,
regardless of how we look, what we have achieved, or what others may
think of us. Even when we chose to turn from God in our sinfulness,
God valued us so much that He sent His only Son to show us the way to
salvation and eternity with Him.

We are loved by God, and all around us are those who are precious to
Him. May we express our love for Him in return by sharing His love
with others.
