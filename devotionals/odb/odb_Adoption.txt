Adoption

He chose us in Him . . . having predestined us to adoption as sons by
Jesus Christ to Himself. —
Ephesians 1:4-5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 1:3-12

My wife, Marlene, and I have been married for over 35 years. When we
were first dating, we had a conversation I have never forgotten. She
told me that at 6 months old she had been adopted. When I asked her if
she ever wondered about who her real parents were, she responded, “My
mom and dad could have selected any of a number of other babies that
day, but they chose me. They adopted me. They are my real parents.”

That strong sense of identification and gratitude she has for her
adoptive parents should also mark our relationship with God. As
followers of Christ, we have been born from above through faith in Him
and have been adopted into the family of God. Paul wrote, “He chose us
in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
without blame before Him in love, having predestined us to adoption as
sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His
will” (Eph. 1:4-5).

Notice the nature of this transaction. We have been chosen by God and
adopted as His sons and daughters. Through adoption, we have a
radically new relationship with God. He is our beloved Father!

May this relationship stir our hearts to worship Him—our Father—with
gratitude.
