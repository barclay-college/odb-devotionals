Hidden Treasure

In [Christ] are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. —
Colossians 2:3

Today's Scripture: Colossians 1:27–2:3

A British treasure hunter discovered a huge stash of Roman coins
buried in a field in southwest England. Using a metal detector, Dave
Crisp located a large pot holding 52,000 coins. These ancient silver
and bronze coins, which date from the third century AD and weigh more
than 350 pounds, are valued at $5 million.

While Crisp’s treasure may cause us to dream about somehow finding
similar riches, we as Christians should be on a different kind of
treasure hunt. What we seek does not consist of silver and gold.
Rather our quest is to gather the precious gems of insight so that we
might gain the “full assurance of understanding . . . , both of the
Father and of Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge” (Col. 2:2-3). The hidden treasure of knowing the Lord
more completely is found in the Bible. The psalmist said, “I rejoice
at Your Word as one who finds great treasure” (Ps. 119:162).

If we read the Word of God hurriedly or carelessly, we will miss its
deep insights. These truths must be sought earnestly with all the
attention of someone seeking hidden treasure.

Are you eager to find the treasures stored in Scripture? Start
digging!

Reflect & Pray

When reading God’s Word, take special care, To find the rich treasures
hidden there; Give thought to each line, each precept hear, Then
practice it well with godly fear. —Anon.

The treasures of truth in God’s Word are best mined with the spade of
meditation.
