Where Our Fears Live

Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You. —
Psalm 56:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Kings 17:17-24

Twelve years into our marriage, my wife and I were discouraged by the
emotional roller-coaster of hopes raised and dashed in attempting to
have children. A friend tried to “explain” God’s thinking. “Maybe God
knows you’d be a bad father,” he said. He knew that my mother had
struggled with a terrible temper.

Then, Christmas 1988, we learned we were expecting our first child!
But now I had this nagging fear of failure.

The following August, Kathryn joined our family. As nurses and doctors
tended to my wife, Kathryn cried on the warming tray. I offered my
hand to comfort her, and her tiny fingers wrapped around my finger. In
that instant, the Holy Spirit swept through me, assuring me of what I
had only recently doubted—that I would show love to this little one!

The widow of Zarephath also had doubts. Her son had been struck with a
lethal illness. In her despair she cried out, “Have you come to me to
bring my sin to remembrance, and to kill my son?” (1 Kings 17:18). But
God had other plans!

We serve a God who is mightier than the struggles we inherit and who
is full of the desire to forgive, love, and heal the brokenness that
rises up between us and Him. God is present in the places where our
fears live.

Reflect & Pray

Father, make Yourself known to us in our weakest moments and in our
greatest fears. Teach us to receive Your love in a way that enables us
to show it to others, especially those closest to us.

Love swims against the current of life’s false fears.
