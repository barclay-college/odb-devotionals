God’s Great Creation

The birds of the sky nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.
Psalm 104:12

Today's Scripture: Psalm 104:1–6, 10–23

On a recent visit with some of our grandchildren, we enjoyed watching
a web cam that focused on an eagle family in Florida. Every day we
would check in on the mom, the dad, and the baby as they went about
their daily routine in their nest high off the ground. Each day the
parent birds would keep a constant, protective vigil over the eaglet,
bringing it fish from a nearby river for nourishment.

This little eagle family depicts for us one image the psalmist gave us
of God’s magnificent creation in Psalm 104—an array of creation
images, of scenes from the work of God’s creative hand.

We see the majesty of God’s creation as it relates to the universe
(vv. 2–4).

We experience the creation of the earth itself—waters, mountains,
valleys (vv. 5–9).

We enjoy the glory of God’s gift of animals, birds, and crops (vv.
10–18).

We marvel at the cycles God created in our world—morning/night,
darkness/light, work/rest (vv. 19–23).

What a glorious world God has fashioned with His hands for our
enjoyment—and for His glory! “Praise the Lord , my soul!” (v. 1). Each
one of us can say thank You to God for all He has given us to
appreciate and enjoy.
