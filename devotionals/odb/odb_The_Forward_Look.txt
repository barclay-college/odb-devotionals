The Forward Look

Simeon . . . was righteous and devout . . . and the Holy Spirit was on
him.
Luke 2:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:21-35

When the great Dutch painter Rembrandt died unexpectedly at age 63, an
unfinished painting was found on his easel. It focuses on Simeon’s
emotion in holding the baby Jesus when He was brought to the temple in
Jerusalem, 40 days after His birth. Yet the background and normal
detail remain unfinished. Some art experts believe that Rembrandt knew
the end of his life was near and—like Simeon—was ready to “be
dismissed” (Luke 2:29).

The Holy Spirit was upon Simeon (v. 25), so it was no coincidence that
he was in the temple when Mary and Joseph presented their firstborn
son to God. Simeon, who had been looking for the promised Messiah,
took the baby in his arms and praised God, saying: “Sovereign Lord, as
you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace. For my
eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of
all nations: a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of
your people Israel” (vv. 29-32).

Simeon was not longing for the glory days of Israel’s history, but was
looking ahead for the promised Messiah, who would come to redeem all
nations.

Like Simeon, we can have an expectant, forward look in life because we
know that one day we will see the Lord.

Reflect & Pray

Father, may we, like Simeon, be always looking ahead for the appearing
of Jesus our Lord.

Even so, come, Lord Jesus! Revelation 22:20
