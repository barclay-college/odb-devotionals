Taking Refuge

The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and
are safe. —
Proverbs 18:10

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 18:1-10

In the medieval world, farmers would care for their crops until an
enemy appeared on the horizon. Then they would flee with their
families to their fortified city for protection from the marauders.

The city of Carcassonne has been a refuge for generations. Built in
the 5th century bc, this stone fortress has provided protection for
Romans, Gauls, Visigoths, Franks, and French. Its sprawling size and
majestic watchtowers and battlements gave confidence to those hiding
inside its protective walls.

As believers, we can take refuge in the presence of the living God.
The book of Proverbs tells us: “The name of the Lord is a strong
tower; the righteous run to it and are safe” (Prov. 18:10). “The name
of the Lord” refers to God’s character—abounding with faithfulness,
power, and mercy. The term safe means “set on high out of danger.”

We all face threats at times that make us want to run for cover. Some
seek security in material wealth or relationships. But the Christ-
follower has a more secure refuge. Because of who God is and what He
can do for us, our best protection ultimately rests in Him. If you are
facing a threat today, go to the Lord, who is a strong tower. You will
find refuge in His care.
