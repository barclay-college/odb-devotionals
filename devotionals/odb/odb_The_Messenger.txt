The Messenger

I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me.
Malachi 3:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Malachi 3:1–5

“I have a message for you!” A woman working at the conference I was
attending handed me a piece of paper, and I wondered if I should be
nervous or excited. But when I read, “You have a nephew!” I knew I
could rejoice.

Messages can bring good news, bad news, or words that challenge. In
the Old Testament, God used His prophets to communicate messages of
hope or judgment. But when we look closely, we see that even His words
of judgment were intended to lead to repentance, healing, and
restoration.

Both types of messages appear in Malachi 3 when the Lord promised to
send a messenger who would prepare the way for Him. John the Baptist
announced the coming of the true Messenger, Jesus (see Matthew
3:11)—“the messenger of the covenant” (Malachi 3:1) who will fulfill
God’s promises. But He will act “like a refiner’s fire or a
launderer’s soap” (v. 2), for He will purify those who believe in His
word. The Lord sent His word to cleanse His people because of His
loving concern for their well-being.

God’s message is one of love, hope, and freedom. He sent His Son to be
a messenger who speaks our language—sometimes with messages of
correction, but always those of hope. We can trust His message.

Lord Jesus Christ, help me not only to understand Your message but to
live it.

Ask the Lord to help you share His good news with others in the new
year.
