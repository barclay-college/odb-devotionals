Something I Should Know?

He went up on a mountainside by himself to pray.
Matthew 14:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 14:22–36

During a concert, singer-songwriter David Wilcox responded to a
question from the audience about how he composes songs. He said there
are three aspects to his process: a quiet room, an empty page, and the
question, “Is there something I should know?” It struck me as a
wonderful approach for followers of Jesus as we seek the Lord’s plan
for our lives each day.

Throughout Jesus’s public ministry, He took time to be alone in
prayer. After feeding 5,000 people with five loaves of bread and two
fish, He sent His disciples to cross the Sea of Galilee by boat while
He dismissed the crowd (Matt. 14:22). “After [Jesus] had dismissed
them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that
night, he was there alone” (v. 23).

If the Lord Jesus saw the need to be alone with His Father, how much
more do we need a daily time of solitude to pour out our hearts to
God, ponder His Word, and prepare to follow His directions. A quiet
room—anywhere we can focus on the Lord without distractions. An empty
page—a receptive mind, a blank sheet of paper, a willingness to
listen. Is there something I should know? “Lord, speak to me by Your
Spirit, Your written Word, and the assurance of Your direction.”

From that quiet hillside, Jesus descended into a violent storm,
knowing exactly what His Father wanted Him to do (vv. 24–27).
