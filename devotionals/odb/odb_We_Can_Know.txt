We Can Know

I write these things to you . . . that you may know that you have
eternal life.
1 John 5:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 5:10-15

As I sat on a train headed for an important appointment, I began to
wonder if I was on the right train. I had never traveled that route
before and had failed to ask for help. Finally, overcome by
uncertainty and doubt, I exited at the next station—only to be told I
had indeed been on the right train!

That incident reminded me how doubt can rob us of peace and
confidence. At one time I had struggled with the assurance of my
salvation, but God helped me deal with my doubt. Later, after sharing
the story of my conversion and my assurance that I was going to
heaven, someone asked, “How can you be sure you are saved and going to
heaven?” I confidently but humbly pointed to the verse that God had
used to help me: “I write these things to you who believe in the name
of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (1
John 5:13).

God promises that through faith in His Son, Jesus, we already have
eternal life: “God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his
Son” (v. 11). This assurance sharpens our faith, lifts us up when we
are downhearted, and gives us courage in times of doubt.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, during my times of doubt help me remember the promise of
Your Word. Since I have invited Jesus into my life and placed my faith
in His payment for my sins, You have promised me eternal life with
You.

Recalling God’s promises destroys doubt.
