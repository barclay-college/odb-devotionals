A Special Birth

Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His
name Immanuel. —
Isaiah 7:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 7:10-15

In the pages of Scripture, several baby-boy births stand out. Cain,
the firstborn after creation. Isaac, the hope of Israel’s future.
Samuel, the answer to a mother’s fervent prayer. All extremely
important. All joyously expected. And all described exactly the same
by the chroniclers of Scripture: In each case, we are told that the
mother conceived and bore a son (Gen. 4:1; 21:2-3; 1 Sam. 1:20).

Now consider one more baby boy’s birth. The description of this
arrival was much more greatly detailed: a few words were clearly not
enough to tell of Jesus’ birth. In Micah, we were told where He would
be born—Bethlehem (5:2). In Isaiah, that His mother would be a virgin
(7:14), and that He was coming to save people from their sin (ch.53).

In the New Testament, we were given such key information as what His
name would be and why (Matt. 1:21), where He was born in fulfillment
of prophecy (2:6), and how both His birth mother and His adoptive
father were part of God’s plan (1:16).

Jesus’ birth stands above all births. His coming changed the world and
can change our lives. Let’s celebrate Him!
