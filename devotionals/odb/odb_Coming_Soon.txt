Coming Soon!

“Surely I am coming quickly.” —
Revelation 22:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 22:7-21

A “COMING SOON!” announcement often precedes future events in
entertainment and sports, or the launch of the latest technology. The
goal is to create anticipation and excitement for what is going to
happen, even though it may be months away.

While reading the book of Revelation, I was impressed with the “coming
soon” sense of immediacy permeating the entire book. Rather than
saying, “Someday, in the far distant future, Jesus Christ is going to
return to earth,” the text is filled with phrases like “things which
must shortly take place” (1:1) and “the time is near” (v.3). Three
times in the final chapter, the Lord says, “I am coming quickly” (Rev.
22:7,12,20). Other versions translate this phrase as, “I’m coming
soon,” “I’m coming speedily,” and “I’m on My way!”

How can this be—since 2,000 years have elapsed since these words were
written? “Quickly” doesn’t seem appropriate for our experience of
time.

Rather than focusing on a date for His return, the Lord is urging us
to set our hearts on His promise that will be fulfilled. We are called
to live for Him in this present age “looking for the blessed hope and
glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ” (Titus
2:13).
