Hidden Mysteries

Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are
with them. —
2 Kings 6:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 6:15–23

Most of what goes on in the universe we never see. Many things are too
small or move too fast or even too slow for us to see. Using modern
technology, however, filmmaker Louis Schwartzberg is able to show
stunning video images of some of those things—a caterpillar’s mouth,
the eye of a fruit fly, the growth of a mushroom.

Our limited ability to see the awesome and intricate detail of things
in the physical world reminds us that our ability to see and
understand what’s happening in the spiritual realm is equally limited.
God is at work all around us doing things more wonderful than we can
imagine. But our spiritual vision is limited and we cannot see them.
The prophet Elisha, however, actually got to see the supernatural work
that God was doing. God also opened the eyes of his fearful colleague
so he too could see the heavenly army sent to fight on their behalf (2
Kings 6:17).

Fear makes us feel weak and helpless and causes us to think we are
alone in the world. But God has assured us that His Spirit in us is
greater than any worldly power (1 John 4:4).

Whenever we become discouraged by the evil we can see, we need to
think instead about the good work God is doing that we cannot see.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I’m tempted to fear what I cannot understand or control. But my
security rests in You and not in what happens to me or around me. Help
me to rest in Your unfailing love.

Eyes of faith see God at work in everything.
