Supernatural Surveillance

Your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. —
Matthew 6:18

Today's Scripture: Matthew 6:1-6,16-18

Not far from my house, authorities have rigged a camera to snap
pictures of drivers who race through red lights. The offenders later
receive in the mail a ticket along with a “red-light photo,” which is
visual proof of their traffic violation.

Sometimes I think of God in the same way I think of that camera—He’s
up there, just waiting to catch me doing the wrong thing. While God
does see our sin (Heb. 4:13), He sees and takes interest in our good
deeds as well. Due to His supernatural surveillance, God sees the size
of our sacrifice when we give money to the church or to those in need
(Mark 12:41-44). He hears our private prayers (Matt. 6:6). And when we
fast, we can carry on as usual being assured that our “Father . . .
sees in secret” (v.18).

Knowing that God sees everything frees us from thinking about the
watchful eyes of others. When we do what is right, we need no applause
from onlookers; when we sin, we do not need to worry about our
reputation once we settle the issue with God and anyone we’ve harmed.
We can rest knowing that “the eyes of the Lord run to and fro
throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those
whose heart is loyal to Him” (2 Chron. 16:9).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for Your all-seeing nature. You know everything I
think and do. Help me to value Your approval and live according to
Your standards, no matter what anyone else may think.

Others see what we do, but God sees why we do it.
