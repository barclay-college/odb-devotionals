Magic Eye

[God] is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. —
Hebrews 11:6

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 11:1-10

One of my nephews brought a book of Magic Eye images to a family
gathering. Magic Eye images look like ordinary two-dimensional
patterns, but when viewed in a certain way, the flat surface appears
three-dimensional.

We took turns trying to train our eyes to make the three-dimensional
image pop out. One family member had trouble seeing the extra
dimension. Several times I noticed he had the book open, looking at it
from all different distances and directions. But even though he
couldn’t see the hidden image, he believed it was there because others
had seen it.

His persistence made me think about the importance of having the same
tenacity in matters of faith. The danger for those who doubt is that
they stop looking for God because they believe He can’t be found.
Moses warned the Israelites that future generations would wander from
God. He promised, however, that those who seek God with all their
heart and soul will find Him (Deut. 4:29). The book of Hebrews
confirms that God rewards those who diligently seek Him (11:6).

If you struggle to believe, remember: Just because you don’t see God
doesn’t mean He doesn’t exist. He promises to be found by those who
seek Him.

Reflect & Pray

I searched with all my heart to know If God was really there; He
graciously revealed Himself, His mercy, love, and care. —Cetas

Because God is great, He will be sought; because God is good, He will
be found.
