He’s Got This

But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.
2 Peter 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Peter 3:14–18

Pastor Watson Jones remembers learning to ride a bike. His father was
walking alongside when little Watson saw some girls sitting on a
porch. “Daddy, I got this!” he said. He didn’t. He realized too late
he hadn’t learned to balance without his father’s steadying grip. He
wasn’t as grown up as he thought.

Our heavenly Father longs for us to grow up and “become mature,
attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (Ephesians
4:13). But spiritual maturity is different from natural maturity.
Parents raise their children to become independent, to no longer need
them. Our divine Father raises us to daily depend on Him more.

Peter begins his letter by promising “grace and peace . . . through
the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,” and he ends by urging us
to “grow in” that same “grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:2; 3:18). Mature Christians never outgrow
their need for Jesus.

Watson warns, “Some of us are busy slapping Jesus’s hands off the
handlebars of our life.” As if we didn’t need His strong hands to hold
us, to pick us up, and to hug us when we wobble and flop. We can’t
grow beyond our dependence on Christ. We only grow by sinking our
roots deeper in the grace and knowledge of Him.

Reflect & Pray

Where do you feel your dependence on Jesus? How is that a sign of
maturity?

Jesus, thank You for walking alongside me as I grow in my relationship
with You.
