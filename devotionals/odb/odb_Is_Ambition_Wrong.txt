Is Ambition Wrong?

Whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord. —
Colossians 3:23

Today's Scripture: Colossians 3:22-24

Is ambition wrong? Is it wrong to be driven, to push to be the best?
It can be. The difference between right and wrong ambition is in our
goal and motivation—whether it’s for God’s glory or our own.

In 1 Thessalonians 4:1, Paul tells us that Christians are to live
lives “to please God.” For some, the drive to please Him is an instant
transformation at the time of salvation; for others, the
transformation is full of stutter-steps and mis-starts. Whether the
change happens instantly or gradually, the Christian is to pursue
God’s goals, not selfish ones.

So, in the workplace we ask: “How will that job change help me serve
others and glorify God?” Ambition oriented toward God is focused
outward on Him and others, always asking how He has gifted us and
wants to use us.

Paul suggests we work with “sincerity of heart, fearing God” (Col.
3:22). Whatever we’re doing—in the board room, on the docks, wherever
we’re working—we’re to serve as if doing it for God (vv.23-24).

We glorify Him most and enjoy Him most when we work with fervor and
excellence for His pleasure, not ours. For His service and the service
of others, not self-service and personal gain—because He deserves our
all.
