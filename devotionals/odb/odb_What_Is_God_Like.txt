What Is God Like?

The Son is . . . the exact representation of [God’s] being.
Hebrews 1:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 1:1–10

To celebrate a special occasion, my husband took me to a local art
gallery and said I could choose a painting as a gift. I picked out a
small picture of a brook flowing through a forest. The streambed took
up most of the canvas, and because of this much of the sky was
excluded from the picture. However, the stream’s reflection revealed
the location of the sun, the treetops, and the hazy atmosphere. The
only way to “see” the sky was to look at the surface of the water.

Jesus is like the stream, in a spiritual sense. When we want to see
what God is like, we look at Jesus. The writer of Hebrews said He is
“the exact representation of [God’s] being” (1:3). Although we can
learn facts about God through direct statements in the Bible such as
“God is love,” we can deepen our understanding by seeing the way God
would act if He faced the same problems we have on Earth. Being God in
human flesh, this is what Jesus has shown us.

In temptation, Jesus revealed God’s holiness. Confronting spiritual
darkness, He demonstrated God’s authority. Wrestling with people
problems, He showed us God’s wisdom. In His death, He illustrated
God’s love.

Although we cannot grasp everything about God—He is limitless and we
are limited in our thinking—we can be certain of His character when we
look at Christ.
