Something to Brag About

Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their
strength or the rich boast of their riches.
Jeremiah 9:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 9:23–26

What does it mean to be real? That’s the very big question answered in
the small children’s book The Velveteen Rabbit. It’s the story of toys
in a nursery and the velveteen rabbit’s journey to become real by
allowing himself to be loved by a child. One of the other toys is the
old and wise Skin Horse. He “had seen a long succession of mechanical
toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by and by break . . . and pass
away.” They looked and sounded impressive, but their
bragging eventually amounted to nothing when it came to love.

Boasting starts out strong; but in the end, it always fades away.
Jeremiah lists three areas where this is evident: “wisdom . . .
strength . . . riches” (Jeremiah 9:23). The wise old prophet had been
around long enough to know a thing or two, and he countered such
boasting with the Lord’s truth: “But let the one who boasts boast
about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the
Lord ” (v. 24).

Let us, the children, brag about God, our good Father. In the
unfolding story of His great love, it’s the wonderful way you and I
grow to become more and more real.

Reflect & Pray

Think of a person you know who embodies the ability to “boast in the
Lord.” What is one way this week you can follow their example?

Father, help me to remember Jeremiah’s words. May my only boasting be
in the knowledge of You and Your great love which endures forever.
