What’s in the Bank?

Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we
may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
Hebrews 4:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:4-7

In the winter of 2009, a large passenger plane made an emergency
landing in New York’s Hudson River. The pilot, Captain Chesley
Sullenberger, who landed the plane safely with no casualties, was
later asked about those moments in the air when he was faced with a
life-or-death decision. “One way of looking at this,” he said, “might
be that for 42 years I’ve been making small, regular deposits in this
bank of experience, education, and training. And on [that day] the
balance was sufficient so that I could make a very large withdrawal.”

Most of us will at some time face a crisis. Perhaps it will be a job
termination or the results of a medical test, or the loss of a
precious family member or friend. It is in those times that we must
dig down deep into the reserves of our spiritual bank account.

And what might we find there? If we have enjoyed a deepening
relationship with God, we’ve been making regular “deposits” of faith.
We have experienced His grace (2 Cor. 8:9; Eph. 2:4-7). We trust the
promise of Scripture that God is just and faithful (Deut. 32:4; 2
Thess. 3:3).

God’s love and grace are available when His children need to make a
“withdrawal” (Ps. 9:10; Heb. 4:16).
