Flourishing Like a Flower

The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the
field.
Psalm 103:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 103:13–22

My youngest grandson is only two months old, yet every time I see him
I notice little changes. Recently, as I cooed to him, he looked up at
me and smiled! And suddenly I began crying. Perhaps it was joy mixed
with remembering my own children’s first smiles, which I witnessed so
long ago, and yet it feels like just yesterday. Some moments are like
that—inexplicable.

In Psalm 103, David penned a poetic song that praised God while also
reflecting on how quickly the joyful moments of our lives pass by:
“The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the
field; the wind blows over it and it is gone” (vv. 15–16).

But despite acknowledging the brevity of life, David describes the
flower as flourishing, or thriving. Although each individual flower
blossoms and blooms swiftly, its fragrance and color and beauty bring
great joy in the moment. And even though an individual flower can be
quickly forgotten—“its place remembers it no more” (v. 16)—by contrast
we have the assurance that “from everlasting to everlasting the Lord’
s love is with those who fear him” (v. 17).

We, like flowers, can rejoice and flourish in the moment; but we can
also celebrate the truth that the moments of our lives are never truly
forgotten. God holds every detail of our lives, and His everlasting
love is with His children forever!
