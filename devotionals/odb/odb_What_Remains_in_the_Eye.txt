What Remains in the Eye

How many are your works, Lord!
Psalm 104:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 104:24–35

The hummingbird gets its English name from the hum made by its rapidly
beating wings. In other languages, it is known as the “flower-kisser”
(Portuguese) or “flying jewels” (Spanish). One of my favorite names
for this bird is biulu, “what remains in the eye” (Mexican Zapotec).
In other words, once you see a hummingbird, you’ll never forget it.

G. K. Chesterton wrote, “The world will never starve for want of
wonders, but only for want of wonder.” The hummingbird is one of those
wonders. What is so fascinating about these tiny creatures? Maybe it
is their small size (averaging two to three inches) or the speed of
their wings that can flap from 50 to 200 times per second.

We aren’t sure who wrote Psalm 104, but the psalmist was certainly
captivated by nature’s beauty. After describing many of creation’s
wonders, like the cedars of Lebanon and the wild donkeys, he sings,
“May the Lord rejoice in his works” (v. 31). Then he prays, “May my
meditation be pleasing to him” (v. 34).

Nature has plenty of things that can remain in the eye because of
their beauty and perfection. How can we meditate on them and please
God? We can observe, rejoice, and thank God as we contemplate His
works and recapture the wonder.

Reflect & Pray

Father, help me to reflect on the wonders of nature and meditate on
them with thankfulness for all You have done!

Wonder leads to gratitude.
