Light And Shadow

The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who
dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has
shined. —
Isaiah 9:2

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 9:1-7

Art historian Seymour Slive described the great Dutch artist Rembrandt
(1606–1669) as the master of light and shadow, a compelling
storyteller on canvas. Rembrandt’s painting The Adoration of the
Shepherds portrays the darkened stable in Bethlehem where two
shepherds kneel beside the manger while other people stand farther
away. One man holds a lantern, but the brightest light shines not from
his lantern but from the Christ-child, illuminating those who have
gathered close to Him.

Seven centuries before Jesus’ birth, Isaiah used an image of light and
shadow to foretell the coming of a Savior for Israel: “The people who
walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the
land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shined. . . . For
unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given” (Isa. 9:2,6).

Each person may see a different story in Rembrandt’s painting, but
perhaps each of us is represented somewhere in that stable. Are we
kneeling in worship, standing back in hesitation, or hiding from the
light that has penetrated our darkness?

Christmas invites us to step out of the shadows of darkness and to
allow the light of Christ to shine into our hearts.

Reflect & Pray

Observing God’s love from afar Is only a passing delight; But when we
experience Christ’s presence, Our darkness is turned into light. —Hess

Faith in Christ is not a leap into the dark; it’s a step into the
Light.
