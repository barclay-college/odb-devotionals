Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! —
Romans 11:33

Today's Scripture: Psalm 139:1-10

On the FlightAware website, Kathy checked the progress of the small
plane her husband Chuck was piloting to Chicago. With a few clicks,
she could track when he took off, where his flight was at any moment,
and exactly when he would land. A few decades earlier when Chuck was a
pilot in West Africa, Kathy’s only contact had been a high-frequency
radio. She recalls one occasion when 3 days had passed before she was
able to reach him. She had no way of knowing that he was safe but
unable to fly because the airplane had been damaged.

But God was always aware of exactly where Chuck was and what he was
doing, just as He is with us (Job 34:21). Nothing is hidden from His
sight (Heb. 4:13). He knows our thoughts and our words (1 Chron. 28:9;
Ps. 139:4). And He knows what will happen in the future (Isa. 46:10).

God knows everything (1 John 3:20), and He knows you and me intimately
(Ps. 139:1-10). He is aware of each temptation, each broken heart,
each illness, each worry, each sorrow we face.

What a comfort to experience care from the One of whom it is said,
“Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!”
(Rom. 11:33).
