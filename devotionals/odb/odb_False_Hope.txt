False Hope

By grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of
yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works. —
Ephesians 2:8-9

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 2:1-10

The name of a pretty Bavarian town in Germany shares the name of a
place of horror—Dachau. A museum on the grounds of this infamous Nazi
concentration camp attracts many World War II history buffs.

As you look around, it would be hard to miss the misleading words
welded to an iron gate: Arbeit Macht Frei. This phrase—Work Makes You
Free—was just a cruel lie to give false hope to those who entered this
place of death.

Many people today have false hope that they can earn a place in heaven
by working at being good or by doing good things. God’s standard of
perfection, however, requires a totally sinless life. There’s no way
any of us can ever be “good enough.” It is only through the sacrifice
of the sinless Savior that we are made righteous. God made Jesus “who
knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness
of God in Him” (2 Cor. 5:21). Eternal life is given because of God’s
gift of grace—not because of our good works (Eph. 2:8-9).

Don’t let Satan trick you by giving you false hope that your good
works will save you. It is only through Jesus’ work on the cross that
you can have real freedom.

Reflect & Pray

Accept the teaching of the world And hopeless you will be, But trust
in God’s eternal plan If you want life that’s free. —Branon

We are not saved by good works, but by God’s work.
