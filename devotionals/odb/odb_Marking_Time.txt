Marking Time

Let no one who waits on You be ashamed.
Psalm 25:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 25:1–15

The military command, “Mark Time, March” means to march in place
without moving forward.  It is an active pause in forward motion while
remaining mentally prepared and expectantly waiting the next command.

In everyday language, the term marking time has come to mean “motion
without progress, not getting anywhere, not doing anything important
while you wait.” It conveys a feeling of idle, meaningless waiting.

In contrast, the word wait in the Bible often means “to look eagerly
for, to hope, and to expect.” The psalmist, when facing great
difficulties, wrote: “O my God, I trust in You; let me not be ashamed;
let not my enemies triumph over me. Indeed, let no one who waits on
You be ashamed” (Ps. 25:2–3 nkjv).

We often have no choice about the things we must wait for—a medical
diagnosis, a job interview result, the return of a loved one—but we
can decide how we wait. Rather than giving in to fear or apathy, we
can continue to “march in place,” actively seeking God’s strength and
direction each day.

“Show me Your ways, O Lord; teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your truth
and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; on You I wait all
the day” (vv. 4–5 nkjv).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give me grace to embrace the pauses in my life, and to be
prepared to follow Your next command.

Waiting on God is active trust in Him.
