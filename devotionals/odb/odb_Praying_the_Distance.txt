Praying the Distance

Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.
Colossians 4:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 18:1–8

Kevin wiped a tear from his eye as he held out a slip of paper for my
wife, Cari, to read. He knew Cari and I were praying for our daughter
to return to faith in Jesus. “This note was found in my mother’s Bible
after her death, and I hope it encourages you,” he said. At the top of
the note were the words, “For my son, Kevin.” Below them was a prayer
for his salvation.

“I carry this with me in my own Bible today,” Kevin explained. “My
mother prayed for my salvation for more than thirty-five years. I was
far away from God, and I’m a believer now.” He looked intently at us
and smiled through his tears: “Never give up praying for your
daughter—no matter how long it takes.”

His words of encouragement made me think of the introduction to a
story Jesus told about prayer in the gospel of Luke. Luke begins with
the words, “Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that
they should always pray and not give up” (Luke 18:1).

In the story, Jesus contrasts an “unjust judge” (v. 6) who answers a
request merely because he doesn’t want to be further bothered, with a
perfect heavenly Father who cares deeply for us and wants us to come
to Him. We can be encouraged whenever we pray to know that God hears
and welcomes our prayers.

Reflect & Pray

Who’s constantly in your prayers for salvation? How does it help to
know of others’ stories of answered prayer?

Abba, Father, thank You that no request is too large or too small for
You. Help me to pray faithfully for those who do not yet know You!
