Reason to Smile

Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in
fact you are doing.
1 Thessalonians 5:11

Today's Scripture: 1 Thessalonians 5:9–28

In the workplace, words of encouragement matter. How employees talk to
one another has a bearing on customer satisfaction, company profits,
and co-worker appreciation. Studies show that members of the most
effective work groups give one another six times more affirmation than
disapproval, disagreement, or sarcasm. Least productive teams tend to
use almost three negative comments for every helpful word.

Paul learned by experience about the value of words in shaping
relationships and outcomes. Before meeting Christ on the road to
Damascus, his words and actions terrorized followers of Jesus. But by
the time he wrote his letter to the Thessalonians, he had become a
great encourager because of God’s work in his heart. Now by his own
example he urged his readers to cheer one another on. While being
careful to avoid flattery, he showed how to affirm others and reflect
the Spirit of Christ.

In the process, Paul reminded his readers where encouragement comes
from. He saw that entrusting ourselves to God, who loved us enough to
die for us, gives us reason to comfort, forgive, inspire, and lovingly
challenge one another (1 Thess. 5:10–11).

Paul shows us that encouraging one another is a way of helping one
another get a taste of the patience and goodness of God.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, please help us to give others a small taste of the
mercy and kindness You are forever offering us.

What could be better than working to bring out the best in one
another?
