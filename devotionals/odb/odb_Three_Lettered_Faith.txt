Three-Lettered Faith

Yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will be joyful in God my Savior.
Habakkuk 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Habakkuk 3:17–19

With a tendency toward pessimism, I quickly jump to negative
conclusions about how situations in my life will play out. If I’m
thwarted in my efforts on a work project, I’m easily convinced none of
my other projects will be successful either, and—even though utterly
unrelated—I will probably never be able to touch my toes comfortably.
And, woe is me, I’m an awful mother who can’t do anything right.
Defeat in one area unnecessarily affects my feelings in many.

It’s easy for me to imagine how the prophet Habakkuk might have
reacted to what God showed him. He had great cause for despair after
having seen the coming troubles for God’s people; long and arduous
years lay ahead. Things really did look dismal: no fruit, no meat, and
no creature comforts. His words lure me into a pessimistic bed of
hopelessness until he jars me awake again with a small three-letter
word: yet. “Yet I will rejoice in the Lord ” (Habakkuk 3:18). Despite
all the hardships he anticipated, Habakkuk found cause for rejoicing
simply because of who God is.

While we might be prone to exaggerate our problems, Habakkuk truly
faced some extreme hardships. If he could summon praise for God in
those moments, perhaps we can too. When we’re bogged down in the
depths of despair, we can look to God who lifts us up.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You are the reason for all my joy. Help me to fix my eyes on You
when my circumstances are painful and hard.

God is our cause for joy in the midst of despair.
