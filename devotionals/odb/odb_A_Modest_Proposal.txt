A Modest Proposal

[Jesus] humbled Himself . . . to the point of death, even the death of
the cross. —
Philippians 2:8

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:1-11

As a college student, I heard count- less engagement stories. My
starry-eyed friends told about glitzy restaurants, mountaintop
sunsets, and rides in horse-drawn carriages. I also recall one story
about a young man who simply washed his girlfriend’s feet. His “modest
proposal” proved he understood that humility is vital for a lifelong
commitment.

The apostle Paul also understood the significance of humility and how
it holds us together. This is especially important in marriage. Paul
said to reject “me-first” urges: “Let nothing be done through selfish
ambition” (Phil. 2:3). Instead, we should value our spouses more than
ourselves, and look out for their interests.

Humility in action means serving our spouse, and no act of service is
too small or too great. After all, Jesus “humbled Himself . . . to the
point of death, even the death of the cross” (v.8). His selflessness
showed His love for us.

What can you do today to humbly serve the one you love? Maybe it’s as
simple as leaving brussels sprouts off the dinner menu or as difficult
as helping him or her through a long illness. Whatever it is, placing
our spouse’s needs before our own confirms our commitment to each
other through Christlike humility.

Reflect & Pray

In marriage, we will honor Christ By following His lead Of sacrificial
love and care To meet the other’s need. —Sper

If you think it’s possible to love your spouse too much, you probably
haven’t loved enough.
