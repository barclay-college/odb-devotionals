The Best Fishing Holes

He was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words. —
2 Corinthians 12:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 22:1-5

My friend Gus passed away a few months ago. Gus was a fellow trout
fisherman. Weekends usually found him in his little boat on a nearby
lake, casting for fish. I got a letter from his daughter Heidi the
other day. She told me she’s been talking about heaven with her
grandkids since Gus went to his home in heaven. Her 6-year-old
grandson, who also loves to fish, explained what heaven is like and
what Great-Grandpa Gus is doing: “It’s really beautiful,” he mused,
“and Jesus is showing Grandpa Gus where the best fishing holes are.”

When Paul reported his God-given vision of heaven, words failed him.
He said, “I was caught up to paradise and heard things so astounding
that they cannot be expressed in words” (2 Cor. 12:4 nlt). Words
cannot convey the facts of heaven—perhaps because we humans are unable
to comprehend them.

While we might gain some comfort from knowing more details about
heaven, it is not the knowledge of heaven that assures us; it is our
knowledge of God Himself. Because I know Him and I know how good He
is, I can leave this life and everything in it with utter confidence
that heaven will be beautiful and Jesus will show me “where the best
fishing holes are”—because that’s the kind of God He is!

Reflect & Pray

Let us beg and pray Him day by day to reveal Himself to our souls more
fully, to quicken our sense, to give us sight and hearing, taste and
touch of the world to come. —John Henry Newman

Nothing on earth compares to being with Christ in heaven.
