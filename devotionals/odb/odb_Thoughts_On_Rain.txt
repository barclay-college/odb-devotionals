Thoughts On Rain

He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on
the just and on the unjust. —
Matthew 5:45

Today's Scripture: Matthew 5:38-48

When torrential downpours beat on the heads of my newly planted
petunias, I felt bad for them. I wanted to bring them inside to
shelter them from the storm. By the time the rain stopped, their
little faces were bowed to the ground from the weight of the water.
They looked sad and weak. Within a few hours, however, they perked up
and turned their heads skyward. By the next day, they were standing
straight and strong.

What a transformation! After pounding them on the head, the rain
dripped from their leaves, soaked into the soil, and came up through
their stalks, giving them the strength to stand straight.

Because I prefer sunshine, I get annoyed when rain spoils my outdoor
plans. I sometimes wrongly think of rain as something negative. But
anyone who has experienced drought knows that rain is a blessing. It
nourishes the earth for the benefit of both the just and the unjust
(Matt. 5:45).

Even when the storms of life hit so hard that we nearly break from the
force, the “rain” is not an enemy. Our loving God has allowed it to
make us stronger. He uses the water that batters us on the outside to
build us up on the inside, so we may stand straight and strong.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we know that we don’t need to fear the storms of life. Because
You are good, we can trust You to use even our hard times to build our
faith in You. We lean on You now.

The storms that threaten to destroy us God will use to strengthen us.
