A Warm Welcome

Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
1 Peter 4:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 4:7–11

“Who will hug everybody?”

That was one of the questions our friend Steve asked after he got the
news that he had cancer and realized he would be away from our church
for a while. Steve is the kind of man who makes everyone feel
welcome—with a friendly greeting, a warm handshake, and even a “holy
hug” for some—to adapt an application from Romans 16:16, which says,
“Greet one another with a holy kiss.”

And now, as we pray for Steve that God will heal him, he is concerned
that as he goes through surgery and treatment—and is away from our
church for a time—we will miss out on those welcoming greetings.

Perhaps not all of us are cut out to greet one another as openly as
Steve does, but his example of caring for people is a good reminder to
us. Notice that Peter says to “offer hospitality to one another
without grumbling,” or in a way that centers on love (1 Peter 4:9; see
Philippians 2:14). While first-century hospitality included offering
accommodations to travelers—even that always starts with a welcoming
greeting.

As we interact with others in love, whether with a hug or just a
friendly smile, we do so “that in all things God may be praised
through Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 4:11).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help us to represent You to others. Guide us to show hospitality
in a way that will show others Your love.

When we practice hospitality, we share God’s goodness.
