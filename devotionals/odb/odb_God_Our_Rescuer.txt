God Our Rescuer

I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered.
Ezekiel 34:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ezekiel 34:5–12

In the open sea, a rescuer positioned her kayak to assist panicked
swimmers competing in a triathlon. “Don’t grab the middle of the
boat!” she called to swimmers, knowing such a move would capsize her
craft. Instead, she directed weary swimmers to the bow, or front, of
the kayak. There they could grab a loop, allowing the safety kayaker
to help rescue them.

Whenever life or people threaten to pull us under, as believers in
Jesus, we know we have a Rescuer. “For this is what the Sovereign Lord
says: I myself will search for my sheep . . . . I will rescue them
from all the places where they were scattered” (Ezekiel 34:11–12).

This was the prophet Ezekiel’s assurance to God’s people when they
were in exile. Their leaders had neglected and exploited them,
plundering their lives and caring “for themselves rather than for
[God’s] flock” (v. 8). As a result, the people “were scattered over
the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them” (v. 6).

But “I will rescue my flock,” declared the Lord (v. 10), and His
promise still holds.

What do we need to do? Hold fast to almighty God and His promises. “I
myself will search for my sheep and look after them,” He says (v. 11).
That’s a saving promise worth holding tightly.

Reflect & Pray

When you feel panicked, what’s your typical reaction? What problem can
you release today as you reach instead for God?

Our rescuing God, when life makes me panic, encourage me to turn from
the rolling waves and always reach for You.
