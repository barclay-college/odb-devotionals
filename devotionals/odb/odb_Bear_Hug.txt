Bear Hug

God is love.
1 John 4:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:13–19

“Bear” was a gift for my grandchild—a heaping helping of love
contained in a giant stuffed animal frame. Baby D’s response? First,
wonder. Next, an amazed awe. Then, a curiosity that nudged a daring
exploration. He poked his pudgy finger at Bear’s nose, and when the
Bear tumbled forward into his arms he responded with joy joy JOY! Baby
D laid his toddler head down on Bear’s fluffy chest and hugged him
tightly. A dimpled smile spread across his cheeks as he burrowed
deeply into Bear’s cushiony softness. The child had no idea of Bear’s
inability to truly love him. Innocently and naturally, he felt love
from Bear and returned it with all his heart.

In his first of three letters to early Christians, the apostle John
boldly states that God Himself is love. “We know and rely on the love
God has for us,” he writes. “God is love” (1 John 4:16).

God loves. Not in the pillow of a pretend animal but rather with the
outstretched arms of a real human body encasing a beating but breaking
heart (John 3:16). Through Jesus, God communicated His extravagant and
sacrificial love for us.

John goes on, “We love because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). When
we believe we’re loved, we love back. God’s real love makes it
possible for us to love God and others—with all our hearts.
