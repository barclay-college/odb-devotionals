Who Am I Working For?

“For whom am I toiling,” he asked, “and why am I depriving myself of
enjoyment?”
Ecclesiastes 4:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 4:4-16

Henry worked 70 hours a week. He loved his job and brought home a
sizeable paycheck to provide good things for his family. He always had
plans to slow down but he never did. One evening he came home with
great news—he had been promoted to the highest position in his
company. But no one was home. Over the years, his children had grown
up and moved out, his wife had found a career of her own, and now the
house was empty. There was no one to share the good news with.

Solomon talked about the need to keep a balance in life with our work.
He wrote, “Fools fold their hands and ruin themselves” (Eccl. 4:5). We
don’t want to go to the extreme of being lazy, but neither do we want
to fall into the trap of being a workaholic. “Better one handful with
tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind”
(v. 6). In other words, it is better to have less and enjoy it more.
Sacrificing relationships at the altar of success is unwise.
Achievement is fleeting, while relationships are what make our life
meaningful, rewarding, and enjoyable (vv. 7-12).

We can learn to work to live and not live to work by choosing to
apportion our time wisely. The Lord can give us this wisdom as we seek
Him and trust Him to be our Provider.
