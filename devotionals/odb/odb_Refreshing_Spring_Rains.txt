Refreshing Spring Rains

He will come to us like the . . . spring rains that water the earth.
Hosea 6:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hosea 6:1–4

Needing a break, I went for a walk in the nearby park. As I headed
down the path, a burst of green caught my attention. Out of the mud
appeared shoots of life that in a few weeks would be cheerful
daffodils, heralding spring and the warmth to come. We had made it
through another winter!

As we read through the book of Hosea, it can feel in parts like an
unrelenting winter. For the Lord gave this prophet the unenviable task
of marrying an unfaithful woman as a picture of the Creator’s love for
His people Israel (1:2–3). Hosea’s wife, Gomer, broke their wedding
vows, but Hosea welcomed her back, yearning that she would love him
devotedly (3:1–3). So too the Lord desires that we love Him with a
strength and commitment that won’t evaporate like the morning mist.

How do we relate to God? Do we seek Him mainly in times of trouble,
searching for answers in our distress but ignoring Him during our
seasons of celebration? Are we like the Israelites, easily swayed by
the idols of our age, including such things as busyness, success, and
influence?

Today, may we recommit ourselves to the Lord, who loves us as surely
as the flowers bud in the spring.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, You gave Yourself that we might be free. Help us to love
You wholeheartedly.

Though we may be unfaithful to God, He will never turn from us.
