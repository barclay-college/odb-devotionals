Fresh Faith

Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised
is faithful.
Hebrews 10:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 20:24–29

When our son was struggling with heroin addiction, if you had told me
God would one day use our experience to encourage other families who
face these kinds of battles, I would have had trouble believing it.
God has a way of bringing good out of difficult circumstances that
isn’t always easy to see when you are going through them.

The apostle Thomas also didn’t expect God to bring good out of the
greatest challenge of his faith—Jesus’s crucifixion. Thomas wasn’t
with the other disciples when Jesus came to them after the
resurrection, and in his deep grief he insisted, “Unless I see the
nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were . . . I
will not believe” (John 20:25). But later, when Jesus appeared to all
the disciples together, out of the dust of Thomas’s doubts God’s
Spirit would inspire a striking statement of faith. When Thomas
exclaimed, “My Lord and my God!” (v. 28), he was grasping the truth
that Jesus was actually God in the flesh, standing right in front of
him. It was a bold confession of faith that would encourage and
inspire believers in every century that followed.

Our God is able to inspire fresh faith in our hearts, even in moments
when we least expect it.  We can always look forward to His
faithfulness. Nothing is too hard for Him!

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, that Your love is stronger than our greatest
difficulties—even our worst doubts or fears!

God can change our doubts into bold statements of faith.
