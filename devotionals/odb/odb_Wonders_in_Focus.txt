Wonders in Focus

For from him and through him and for him are all things.
Romans 11:36

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 38:1–18

Some of us are inclined to look at the world and see only what’s
wrong. DeWitt Jones is a National Geographic photographer who has used
his profession to celebrate what’s right about the world. He waits and
watches until a shaft of light or turn of perspective suddenly reveals
a wonder that had been there all along. He uses his camera to find
beauty in the most common faces of people and nature.

If anyone had reason to focus on the wrongs of the world, Job did.
After losing all that had given him joy, even his friends became his
accusers. Together their voices taunted him for not admitting that he
was suffering for sins he was hiding. When Job cried out to the
heavens for help, God remained silent.

Finally, from within the chaos of a whirlwind and the darkness of a
storm, God asked Job to consider wonders of nature that reflect a
wisdom and power far beyond our own (Job 38:2–4).

Would He now ask us? What about something as natural as the ways of a
dog, cat, fluttering leaf, or blade of grass? Could a shaft of light,
or a turn of perspective, reveal—even in our pain—the mind and heart
of a Creator who has been with us and for us all along?

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, we’ve spent too much time thinking only about what
is wrong and broken with our world. Please help us to see evidence of
Your presence in the wonder of what only You could have done.

In the faces of nature there are wonders that never cease.
