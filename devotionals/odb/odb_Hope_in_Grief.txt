Hope in Grief

Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he
disappeared from their sight.
Luke 24:31

Today's Scripture: Luke 24:13–32

When I was nineteen, one of my close friends was killed in a car
accident. In the following weeks and months, I walked each day in a
tunnel of grief. The pain of losing someone so young and wonderful
clouded my vision, and at times I even felt unaware of what was going
on around me. I felt so blinded by pain and grief that I simply could
not see God.

In Luke 24, two disciples, confused and brokenhearted after Jesus’s
death, didn’t realize they were walking with their resurrected Teacher
Himself, even as He explained from Scripture why the promised Savior
had to die and rise again. Only when He took bread and broke it was it
revealed that this was Jesus (vv. 30–31). Although the followers of
Jesus had faced death in all its horror when Jesus died, through His
resurrection from the dead God showed them how to hope again.

Like those disciples, we might feel weighed down with confusion or
grief. But we can find hope and comfort in the reality that Jesus is
alive and at work in the world—and in us. Although we still face
heartache and pain, we can welcome Christ to walk with us in our
tunnel of grief. As the Light of the world (John 8:12), He can bring
rays of hope to brighten our fog.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, thank You for being the light in the darkness. Bring hope
when I’m sad and confused, and help me to see Your glory.

Though we grieve, we have hope in Jesus.
