Remember The Sacrifice

Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in
remembrance of Me. —
1 Corinthians 11:24

Today's Scripture: 1 Cor. 11:23-34

Every Memorial Day, we remember those who have died in the service of
their country. In the United States, a place where such remembrances
carry a deep and emotional significance is Arlington National
Cemetery, near Washington, DC. Arlington is a serious place where, due
to the passing of aging war veterans and the ongoing conflicts around
the world, there are currently about 25 military funerals every day.

This is particularly difficult for The Old Guard—members of the 3rd US
Infantry Regiment who serve at Arlington. It is their task to bear the
bodies of the fallen and honor their sacrifice. The members of The Old
Guard never forget the price of liberty—for they are reminded of it
every day.

Believers in Christ have been given the Lord’s Supper as a reminder of
what our freedom from sin cost the Lord Jesus Christ. As we partake of
the bread and the cup, we fulfill His command to “do this in
remembrance of Me” (1 Cor. 11:24). But in the sober celebration of the
sacrifice of Christ there is joy. For we need not leave our
remembrances at the Lord’s Table. Living our lives for the Savior can
show the world that we will never forget the sacrifice He has made for
us.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for dying for me On the cross of Calvary; Help me
always to remember What You did to set me free. —Sper

Remembering Christ’s death for us should cause us to live for Him.
