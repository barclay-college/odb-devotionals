The Beauty of Love

May your fountain be blessed.
Proverbs 5:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 5

The “Jarabe Tapatío,” also known as the Mexican hat dance, celebrates
romance. During this upbeat dance, the man places his sombrero on the
ground. At the very end, the woman grabs the hat and both hide behind
it to seal their romance with a kiss.

This dance reminds me of the importance of faithfulness in marriage.
In Proverbs 5, after talking about the high cost of immorality, we
read that marriage is exclusive. “Drink water from your own cistern,
running water from your own well” (v. 15). Even with ten couples
dancing the Jarabe on stage, each person focuses on his or her
partner. We can rejoice in a deep and undivided commitment to our
spouse (v. 18).

Our romance is also being observed. The dancers, while they are
enjoying their partner, know someone is watching. In the same way, we
read, “For your ways are in full view of the Lord , and he examines
all your paths” (v. 21). God wants to protect our marriages, so He’s
constantly watching us. May we please Him through the loyalty we show
to each other.

Just like in the Jarabe there is a rhythm to follow in life. When we
keep the beat of our Creator by being faithful to Him—whether we are
married or unmarried—we find blessings and joy.
