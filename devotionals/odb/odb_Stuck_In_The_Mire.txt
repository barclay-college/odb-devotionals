Stuck In The Mire

His word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones; I
was weary of holding it back. —
Jeremiah 20:9

Today's Scripture: Jeremiah 20:7-13

Jeremiah has been called “the weeping prophet.” He may have had a
sensitive and melancholic disposition that was compounded by his
heartbreak over God’s judgment on disobedient Israel. His capacity for
sorrow is amazing: “Oh, that my head were waters, and my eyes a
fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night!” (Jer. 9:1).

As if sorrow for his nation were not enough, Jeremiah was persecuted
for his prophetic message of judgment. In one instance, Jeremiah was
imprisoned in a cistern filled with mire (Jer. 38:6). Opposition to
his ministry had gotten the great prophet stuck in a place of despair.

Sometimes in our attempts to serve the Lord, we can feel stuck in
painful circumstances and surprising heartache. But the prophet’s
resilience should inspire us to persevere. Jeremiah’s sense of divine
call was so strong that he could not be deterred from serving the
Lord. “But His word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my
bones; I was weary of holding it back, and I could not” (Jer. 20:9).

Have the results of your service for the Lord been disappointing? Ask
Him to renew your heart by His Spirit, and continue to serve God
despite your setbacks.

No service for Christ is insignificant.
