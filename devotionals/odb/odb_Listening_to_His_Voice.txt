Listening to His Voice

My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.
John 10:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 10:25–30

I’m hard of hearing—“deaf in one ear and can’t hear out of the other,”
as my father used to say. So I wear a set of hearing aids.

Most of the time the devices work well, except in environments where
there’s a lot of surrounding noise. In those settings, my hearing aids
pick up every voice in the room and I cannot hear the person in front
of me.

So it is with our culture: a cacophony of sounds can drown out God’s
quiet voice. “Where shall the Word be found, where will the Word
resound?” poet T.S. Eliot asks. “Not here, there is not enough
silence.”

Fortunately, my hearing aids have a setting that cuts out the
surrounding sounds and enables me to hear only the voices I want to
hear. In the same way, despite the voices around us, if we quiet our
souls and listen, we will hear God’s “still small voice” (1 Kings
19:11–12 nkjv ).

He speaks to us every day, summoning us in our restlessness and our
longing. He calls to us in our deepest sorrow and in the
incompleteness and dissatisfaction of our greatest joys.

But primarily God speaks to us in His Word (1 Thessalonians 2:13). As
you pick up His book and read it, you too will hear His voice. He
loves you more than you can ever know, and He wants you to hear what
He has to say.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for giving us Your Word. Help me to listen to
Your voice as I spend time alone with You.

God speaks through His Word when we take time to listen.
