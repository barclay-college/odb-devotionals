God’s Direction

In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.
—nkjv
Proverbs 3:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 3:1–8

A century ago, 41-year-old Oswald Chambers arrived in Egypt to serve
as a YMCA chaplain to British Commonwealth troops during World War I.
He was assigned to a camp at Zeitoun, six miles north of Cairo. On his
first night there, October 27, 1915, Chambers wrote in his diary,
“This [area] is absolutely desert in the very heart of the troops and
a glorious opportunity for men. It is all immensely unlike anything I
have been used to, and I am watching with interest the new things God
will do and engineer.”

Chambers believed and practiced the words of Proverbs 3:5-6: “Trust in
the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding;
in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths”
(Prov. 3:5-6 nkjv).

This is both a comfort and a challenge. There is security in knowing
that the Lord will lead us each day, but we must not become so
attached to our plans that we resist God’s redirection or His timing.

“We have no right to judge where we should be put, or to have
preconceived notions as to what God is fitting us for,” said Chambers.
“God engineers everything. Wherever He puts us, our one great aim is
to pour out a whole-hearted devotion to Him in that particular work.”
