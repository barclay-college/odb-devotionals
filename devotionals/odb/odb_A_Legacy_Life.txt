A Legacy Life

A good name is more desirable than great riches.
Proverbs 22:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 22:1–12

While staying in a hotel in a small town I noticed that the church
across the street was having a service. People were jammed into the
church with a standing-room-only crowd of both young and old flowing
out onto the sidewalk. When I noticed a hearse by the curb, I realized
it was a funeral. And given the crowd, I assumed that it was the
celebration of the life of some local hero—perhaps a wealthy
businessperson or a famous personality. Curious, I said to the desk
clerk, “That’s an amazing turnout for a funeral; it must be for a
famous person in town.”

“No,” he replied. “He wasn’t rich or famous but he was a good man.”

This reminded me of the wisdom of the proverb that says, “A good name
is more desirable than great riches” (Prov. 22:1). It’s a good idea to
think about what kind of legacy we are leaving for our family,
friends, and neighbors. From God’s perspective it’s not our resumé or
the amount of money we’ve accumulated that matters but rather the kind
of life we have lived.

When a friend of mine passed away, his daughter wrote, “This world has
lost a righteous man and in this world that is no small thing!” It’s
that kind of legacy that we should be seeking for the glory of God.
