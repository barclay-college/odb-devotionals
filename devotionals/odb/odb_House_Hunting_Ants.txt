House-Hunting Ants

Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations. —
Psalm 90:1

Today's Scripture: Numbers 13:25–14:19

According to researchers from the University of Bristol, the European
rock ant may be better than we are at staying on top of the housing
market. The researchers found that the ant colonies use scout ants to
continually monitor their colonies’ living conditions. Using social
skills complex enough to stun the scientists, the rock ants work
together to find the right living space, darkness, and security needed
to give the queen mother and her larvae the best available housing.

In the days of Moses, the families of Israel were looking for a new
home. The slave yards of Egypt had been brutal. The wilderness of
Sinai was no place to settle down. But there was a problem. According
to Israelite scouts, the homeland to which God was leading them was
already occupied—by walled cities and giants who made the scouts feel
like grasshoppers in their own eyes (Num. 13:28,33).

Sometimes it may be helpful to compare ourselves to insects. House-
hunting rock ants instinctively follow the ways of their Creator. But
we often let our fears keep us from following and trusting God. When
we rest in the assurance of His presence and love, we can say, “Lord,
You have been our dwelling place in all generations.”

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, please help us to see that today there is no better
place to live than in Your presence and love. Help us learn to settle
in and be comfortable with our place in You.

Finding ourselves at home in God is a good place to be.
