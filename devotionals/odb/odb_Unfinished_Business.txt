Unfinished Business

Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom. —
Luke 23:42

Today's Scripture: Luke 23:32-43

At age 99, Leo Plass received his college diploma from Eastern Oregon
University. He had stopped working on his teaching degree during the
1930s when he left college to earn an income in the logging industry.
Seventy-nine years later, he completed the three credits necessary to
graduate and resolve this important unfinished business in his life.

Many of us can relate to Leo. Our unfinished business may include
apologies left unsaid or, even more important, unfinished spiritual
decisions. One of the criminals who was crucified with Jesus needed
desperately to make such a decision. Just a few breaths away from
eternity, he realized who Jesus was and wanted to be with Him in
heaven. He recognized his sin and Jesus’ innocence, and said, “Lord,
remember me when You come into Your kingdom” (Luke 23:42). Jesus
replied, “Assuredly, . . . today you will be with Me in Paradise”
(v.43).

God does not want anyone to perish (2 Peter 3:9). His offer of
salvation is open to anyone, regardless of age, health, or stage in
life. His offer is open to you. Don’t delay receiving Jesus as Savior
(2 Cor. 6:2). Resolve this important, unfinished business, and you’ll
look forward to eternity with Him.
