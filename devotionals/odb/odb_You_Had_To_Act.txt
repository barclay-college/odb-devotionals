You Had To Act

No man ever spoke like this Man! —
John 7:46

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 7:37-46

A US congressman, John Lewis, was 23 years old when he participated in
the historic 1963 civil rights “March on Washington” led by Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. Half a century later, journalist Bill Moyers asked
Lewis how he was affected by Dr. King’s I Have A Dream speech that
day. Mr. Lewis replied, “You couldn’t leave after hearing him speak
and go back to business as usual. You had to do something, you had to
act. You had to move. You had to go out and spread the good news.”

Many who encountered Jesus found it impossible to remain neutral about
Him. John 7:25-46 records two different reactions to Jesus. While
“many of the people believed in Him” (v.31), the religious leaders
tried to silence Him by sending temple guards to arrest Him (v.32).
The guards were likely present when Jesus said, “If anyone thirsts,
let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture
has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water”
(vv.37-38). The guards returned without Jesus and were asked, “Why
have you not brought Him?” (v.45). They answered, “No man ever spoke
like this Man!” (v.46).

The words of Jesus compel us to act, and to move, beyond business as
usual.

Reflect & Pray

So let our lips and lives express The holy gospel we profess; So let
our works and virtues shine, To prove the doctrine all divine. —Watts

Jesus’ death forgave my past sins and inspires my present obedience.
