Charlie’s Walk On The Moon

Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him. —
Genesis 5:24

Today's Scripture: Genesis 5:21-32

The documentary In the Shadow of the Moon includes the story of
Charlie Duke, one of the Apollo 16 astronauts launched to the moon in
1972. While the command ship orbited the moon, Duke and another
astronaut landed the lunar module Orion on the moon’s surface. After 3
days of running experiments and collecting lunar rocks, the Apollo 16
crew safely returned to earth.

Later, Charlie had a spiritual transformation. He said it began when
his friend invited him to a Bible study. After the meeting, Charlie
prayed to Christ, “I give You my life, and if You’re real come into my
life.” He then experienced an indescribable peace. It was so profound
that he began to share his story with others. Charlie told them, “My
walk on the moon lasted 3 days and it was a great adventure, but my
walk with God lasts forever.”

The Bible tells us of another man who walked with God. “Enoch walked
with God; and he was not, for God took him” (Gen. 5:24). His spiritual
walk with God was so close that God took him directly into eternity
(see Heb. 11:5).

We can learn a lesson from Charlie and Enoch. For believers, no matter
where our journey leads, our walk with God will last for eternity!
