The Life That Matters

Remember those . . . who have spoken the Word of God to you, whose
faith follow. —
Hebrews 13:7

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 5:1-7

Isaac Hann was a little-known pastor who served a small church in
Loughwood, England, in the mid-18th century. At the close of his
ministry, the membership of the church numbered 26 women and 7 men.
And only 4 of the men attended with any regularity.

In this age of mass media and mega-churches, who would consider this a
successful work? In our world today, Isaac Hann would be considered
one of those pastors who never quite “made it.” He certainly wouldn’t
have been invited to speak at pastors’ conferences, nor would he have
written articles on church growth.

Yet, when he died at 88 his parishioners placed a plaque on the wall
of their meeting house that remains to this day. It reads in part:

Few ministers so humble were, yet few so much admired: Ripened for
heaven by grace divine, like autumn fruit he fell;

Reader think not to live so long, but seek to live as well.

First Peter 5:5-6 comes to mind: “God resists the proud, but gives
grace to the humble. Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand
of God, that He may exalt you in due time.” Reverend Isaac Hann “made
it big” in a way that matters—humility before God and a reward in
heaven. We can too.

Reflect & Pray

True greatness does not come to those Who strive for worldly fame, It
lies instead with those who choose To serve in Jesus’ name. —D. De
Haan

Humility is the recipe for success.
