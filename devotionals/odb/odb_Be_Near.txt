Be Near

The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart. —
Psalm 34:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:4-18

My friend was going through some difficult challenges in her life and
family. I didn’t know what to say or do, and I told her so. She looked
at me and said, “Just be near.” That’s what I did, and later on we
started talking about God’s love.

Many times we don’t know how to respond when others are grieving, and
words may do more harm than good. Serving others requires that we
understand them and find out what they need. Often we can help by
meeting practical needs. But one of the best ways to encourage those
who are suffering is to be near—to sit beside them and listen.

God is near to us when we call out to Him. “The righteous cry out, and
the Lord hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles,” the
psalmist says. “The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, and
saves such as have a contrite spirit” (Ps. 34:17-18).

By putting ourselves in the shoes of others and allowing our hearts to
feel compassion, we can help those who are hurting. We can be near
them as God is with us and sit close to them. At the right time, the
Holy Spirit will give us the words to say, if they are needed.

Who needs my help or for me to sit alongside them this week?

The best way to encourage others may be to just be near.
