Are You There?

I will be with you.
Exodus 3:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 3:11–14

When his wife contracted a terminal illness, Michael longed for her to
experience the peace he had through his relationship with God. He had
shared his faith with her, but she wasn’t interested. One day, as he
walked through a local bookstore, a title caught his eye: God, Are You
There? Unsure how his wife would respond to the book, he walked in and
out of the store several times before finally buying it. To his
surprise, she accepted it.

The book touched her, and she began to read the Bible too. Two weeks
later, Michael’s wife passed away—at peace with God and resting in the
assurance that He would never leave or forsake her.

When God called Moses to lead His people out of Egypt, He didn’t
promise him power. Instead, He promised His presence: “I will be with
you” (Exodus 3:12). In Jesus’s last words to His disciples before His
crucifixion, He also promised God’s eternal presence, which they would
receive through the Holy Spirit (John 15:26).

There are many things God could give us to help us through life’s
challenges, such as material comfort, healing, or immediate solutions
to our problems. Sometimes He does. But the best gift He gives is
Himself. This is the greatest comfort we have: whatever happens in
life, He will be with us; He will never leave nor forsake us.

Reflect & Pray

How can you draw on the power of God’s presence? How can you live
differently, knowing He’s there with you every step of the way?

Lord, thank You for the wonderful promise that You’ll be with me
always. In the midst of life’s crises and routines, may I learn to
rely on Your presence, knowing You are walking with me.
