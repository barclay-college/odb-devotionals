Thanksgiving Pardon

The blood of Jesus Christ [God’s] Son cleanses us from all sin. —
1 John 1:7

Today's Scripture: 1 John 1:1-10

Each year at the end of November, the President of the United States
issues an official pardon for the National Thanksgiving Turkey. During
this lighthearted ceremony, one president remarked: “Our guest of
honor looks a little nervous. Nobody’s told him yet that I’m going to
give him a pardon.” The poor turkey had a good reason to be
uneasy—without an acquittal, he was doomed to be Thanksgiving dinner.

We are in a similar situation when it comes to our sin. Without God’s
pardon, we’re on our way to certain demise. This condition is a direct
result of our own wrongdoing. The Bible says, “The wages of sin is
death” (Rom. 6:23). However, we can be set free from this death
sentence because God’s Son bore our sin in His body on the cross,
“that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose
stripes you were healed” (1 Peter 2:24). First John 1:7 tells us that
Jesus’ blood “cleanses us from all sin.”

We can accept God’s pardon for our sin and receive eternal life when
we confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe that God raised Him
from the dead (Rom. 10:9). Today, consider how you will respond to
God’s offer of forgiveness.
