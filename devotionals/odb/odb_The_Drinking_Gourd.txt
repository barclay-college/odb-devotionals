The Drinking Gourd

Shine as lights in the world, holding fast the word of life. —
Philippians 2:15-16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:12-18

Prior to the American Civil War (1861–1865), fugitive slaves found
freedom by following the Underground Railroad, a term for the secret
routes from the South to the North and the abolitionists who helped
them along the way. Slaves would travel at night for many miles,
keeping on track by following the light of the “Drinking Gourd.” This
was a code name for the collection of stars known as the Big Dipper,
which points to the North Star. Some believe the fugitives also used
encoded directions in the lyrics of the song “Follow the Drinking
Gourd” to keep them from getting lost as they traveled.

Both the abolitionists and the “drinking gourd” served as points of
light directing the slaves to freedom. The apostle Paul says that
believers are to shine as “lights in the world” to show the way to
those seeking God’s truth, redemption, and spiritual liberation (Phil.
2:15).

We live in a dark world that desperately needs to see the light of
Jesus Christ. Our calling is to shine forth God’s truth so that others
can be directed to the One who redeems and is the path to liberty and
life. We point the way to Jesus, the One who is the way, the truth,
and the life (John 14:6).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for redeeming me and giving me new life. Give me
compassion for those who are still lost in spiritual darkness. Use me
to be a light that points others to You, the Light of the world.

Light up your world by reflecting the light of Jesus.
