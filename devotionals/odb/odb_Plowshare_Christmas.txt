Plowshare Christmas

They shall beat their swords into plowshares . . . ; neither shall
they learn war anymore. —
Isaiah 2:4

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 2:1-4

In his book Christmas 1945, Matthew Litt tells about the first
peacetime Christmas celebration in the US after World War II. The New
York Daily News alerted readers to expect a fleet of warships in New
York Harbor: “Christmas Day will find a mighty armada, consisting of 4
battleships, 6 carriers, 7 cruisers, and 24 destroyers.” But instead
of waging war, the military ships hosted 1,000 needy children.

The children’s measurements had been taken previously so that
perfectly fitted navy-blue coats and woolen caps would be gift-wrapped
and awaiting them aboard the ships. These vessels of war had been
transformed into carriers of compassion.

The prophet Isaiah predicted a future day of Christ’s reign of peace
on this earth: “They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword
against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore” (2:4).
Christmastime serves as a reminder that the Prince of Peace will
ultimately bring a time of global calm and compassion.

As we celebrate the first coming of the Prince of Peace and wait for
His second coming, we are reminded of our privilege to serve as His
“carriers of compassion.”

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You have come and brought peace, and I long to share Your
compassion everywhere I go. Thank You that this world will know
ultimate peace when You return. Amen.

True peace comes from the Prince of Peace.
