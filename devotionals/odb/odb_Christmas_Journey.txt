Christmas Journey

When the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son. —
Galatians 4:4

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:1-7; Galatians 4:4-5

How far is it from Nazareth to Bethlehem? If you’re in Pennsylvania,
it’s about 9 miles and takes about 10 minutes by car. But if you’re in
Nazareth of Galilee, and you’re traveling along with your pregnant
wife, as Joseph was, it’s about 80 miles to Bethlehem. That journey
probably took Joseph and Mary about a week, and they didn’t stay in a
nice hotel when they got there. All Joseph could find was a stall in a
stable, and that’s where Mary delivered “her firstborn Son” (Luke
2:7).

But the journey for the infant Jesus was much farther than 80 miles.
He left His place in heaven at God’s right hand, came to earth, and
accepted our humanity. Eventually, He was stretched out on a cross to
die, and He was buried in a borrowed tomb. But the journey was not
over. He conquered death, left the tomb, walked again among men, and
ascended to heaven. Even that is not the journey’s end. Someday He
will return as King of kings and Lord of lords.

As you take a Christmas journey this month, reflect on the journey
Jesus made for us. He came from heaven to earth to die for us, making
salvation available through His death on the cross and His glorious
resurrection.

Praise God for that first Christmas journey!

Reflect & Pray

When God stepped out of heaven above And came down to this earth, He
clothed Himself in human flesh— A Child of lowly birth. —D. De Haan

Jesus came to earth for us so we could go to heaven with Him.
