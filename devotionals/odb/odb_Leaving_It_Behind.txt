Leaving It Behind

The woman then left her waterpot [and said,] “Come, see a Man who told
me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?” —
John 4:28-29

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 4:9-14,27-29

In the year or so after our teenage son got his driver’s license and
started carrying a wallet, we got several calls from people who had
found it somewhere. We cautioned him to be more careful and not leave
it behind.

Leaving things behind, though, is not always a bad thing. In John 4,
we read about a woman who had come to draw water at a well. But after
she encountered Jesus that day, her intent suddenly changed. Leaving
her water jar behind, she hurried back to tell others what Jesus had
said to her (vv.28-29). Even her physical need for water paled in
comparison to telling others about the Man she had just met.

Peter and Andrew did something similar when Jesus called them. They
left their fishing nets (which was the way they earned their living)
to follow Jesus (Matt. 4:18-20). And James and John left their nets,
boat, and even their father when Jesus called them (vv.21-22).

Our new life of following Jesus Christ may mean that we have to leave
things behind, including those that don’t bring lasting satisfaction.
What we once craved cannot compare with the life and “living water”
that Jesus offers.

Reflect & Pray

Now none but Christ can satisfy, None other name for me; There’s love
and life and lasting joy, Lord Jesus, found in Thee. —McGranahan

Christ showed His love by dying for us; we show ours by living for
Him.
