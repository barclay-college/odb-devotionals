God Is At Work

He is my God, and I will praise Him. —
Exodus 15:2

Today's Scripture: Exodus 14:26–15:2

Jack and Trisha were driving to the hospital late one night for the
birth of their second child when the unexpected happened. Trisha began
to deliver the baby! Jack called 911 and Cherie White, an emergency
dispatcher, was able to talk Jack through the delivery. But the baby
wouldn’t breathe. So Cherie then instructed Jack how to give emergency
breathing, which he had to do for 6 anxious minutes. Finally the
newborn took a breath and cried. When asked later how they all got
through the ordeal and remained calm, Cherie responded, “I’m glad God
works midnights!”

I love to hear media reports in which God gets the glory He deserves
for something good that has happened. In the Bible reading for today,
it’s obvious that God should get the credit for parting the Red Sea to
help His people escape from Pharaoh, even though Moses was the one who
raised his rod (Ex. 14:26-27). All the Israelites and Moses gathered
together and sang the Lord’s praises: “Who is like You, O Lord, among
the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises,
doing wonders?” (15:11).

When something good happens, the Lord deserves the credit, for He is
the source of all that is good. Give Him the glory. Aren’t you glad He
works midnights?
