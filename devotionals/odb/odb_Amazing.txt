Amazing!

Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord
commanded him and took to him his wife. —
Matthew 1:24

Today's Scripture: Matthew 1:18-25

The Christmas story, recorded in Matthew and Luke, has become so
familiar that I wonder if we grasp the reality of what actually
happened: An angel told a young virgin that she would conceive a child
by the power of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:26-38). The angel then told
her fiancé to marry her and name the baby Jesus, “for He will save His
people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21). Shepherds saw angels in the sky
and were told of a Savior’s birth in Bethlehem (Luke 2:11). Wise men
traveled hundreds of miles to worship the One who, they said, “has
been born King of the Jews” (Matt. 2:2). Amazing!

Equally astonishing is that Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, and the wise
men did exactly as they had been told. Mary yielded herself to God;
Joseph took her home as his wife; the shepherds went to Bethlehem to
find the baby in a manger; and the wise men followed the star. With no
idea of the outcome, they all took the next step by faith in the Lord.
Amazing!

How is it with us this Christmas? Will we trust God and follow His
leading even when we face uncertainty and overwhelming circumstances?

When you and I obey the Lord, the outcome is truly amazing!
