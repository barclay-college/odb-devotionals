Never Enough

The eye never has enough of seeing.
Ecclesiastes 1:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 1:1–11

Frank Borman commanded the first space mission that circled the moon.
He wasn’t impressed. The trip took two days both ways. Frank got
motion sickness and threw up. He said being weightless was cool—for
thirty seconds. Then he got used to it. Up close he found the moon
drab and pockmarked with craters. His crew took pictures of the gray
wasteland, then became bored.

Frank went where no one had gone before. It wasn’t enough. If he
quickly tired of an experience that was out of this world, perhaps we
should lower our expectations for what lies in this one. The teacher
of Ecclesiastes observed that no earthly experience delivers ultimate
joy. “The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of
hearing” (1:8). We may feel moments of ecstasy, but our elation soon
wears off and we seek the next thrill.

Frank had one exhilarating moment, when he saw the earth rise from the
darkness behind the moon. Like a blue and white swirled marble, our
world sparkled in the sun’s light. Similarly, our truest joy comes
from the Son shining on us. Jesus is our life, the only ultimate
source of meaning, love, and beauty. Our deepest satisfaction comes
from out of this world. Our problem? We can go all the way to the
moon, yet still not go far enough.

Reflect & Pray

When have you felt the most joy? Why didn’t it last? What can you
learn from its fleeting nature?

Jesus, shine the light of Your love on me.
