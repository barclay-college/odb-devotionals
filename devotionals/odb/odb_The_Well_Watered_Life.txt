The Well-Watered Life

He shall be like a tree planted by the waters . . . ; its leaf will be
green. —
Jeremiah 17:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 17:1-8

I have a friend who lives on a ranch in the wide-open spaces of
Montana. The road to his home is a long trail that winds through the
parched and barren landscape of the wilderness. As you drive toward
his home, you can’t help but notice the contrasting strip of green
trees and vibrant vegetation meandering through the ranch. One of the
finest trout rivers in North America cuts through the property, and
anything that grows near its banks gets the benefit of an unending
source of vital water.

This is the picture Jeremiah paints when he says that those who trust
in the Lord are “like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out
its roots by the river” (Jer. 17:8). Many may choose the wilting heat
and choking drought of life apart from God, but those who trust in God
will be vibrant and fruitful. Depending on Him is like putting our
roots into the refreshing water of His goodness. We are strengthened
with the confidence that His steadfast love for us will never fail.

God will ultimately make all things right. Trusting that He will turn
our pain to gain and use suffering to mature us empowers us to become
fruit-bearers in a dry and thirsty land.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for not leaving me alone in the withering heat of
life. I will put the roots of my trust into the river of Your
unfailing promises and steadfast love!

Put your roots down by the river of God’s goodness.
