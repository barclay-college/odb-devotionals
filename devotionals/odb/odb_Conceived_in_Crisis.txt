Conceived in Crisis

I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has
passed.
Psalm 57:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 57

Marc recalls a moment from his childhood when his father called the
family together. Their car had broken down, and the family would run
out of money by the end of the month. Marc’s dad paused and prayed.
Then he asked the family to expect God’s answer.

Today Marc recalls how God’s help arrived in surprising ways. A friend
repaired their car; unexpected checks arrived; food showed up at the
door. Praising God came easily. But the family’s gratitude had been
forged in a crisis.

Psalm 57 has long provided rich inspiration for worship songs. When
David declared, “Be exalted, O God, above the heavens” (v. 11), we
might imagine him gazing up at a magnificent Middle Eastern night sky
or perhaps singing in a tabernacle worship service. But in reality
David, fearful for his life, was hiding in a cave.

“I am in the midst of lions,” David said in the psalm. These “ravenous
beasts” were “men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are
sharp swords” (v. 4). David’s praise was conceived in crisis. Although
he was cornered by enemies who wanted him dead, David could write
these amazing words: “My heart, O God, is steadfast . . . . I will
sing and make music” (v. 7).

Whatever crisis we face today, we can run to God for help. Then, we
can praise Him as we wait expectantly, confident in His infinitely
creative care for us.
