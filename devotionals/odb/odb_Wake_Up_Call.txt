Wake-Up Call

Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about
like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. —
1 Peter 5:8

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 5:1-9

One early autumn morning as I drove to work in the dark, I was
startled by a flash of brown in my headlights followed by the sound of
something hitting the front of my car. I had clipped a deer at 70
miles per hour! It was only a glancing blow, and no damage was done to
my car (or the deer, as far as I could tell), but it really shook me
up. I had been in my usual “autopilot mode” for the familiar drive to
the office, but the shock of the incident certainly got my attention.
I was now fully alert and trying to calm a racing heartbeat. It was a
most unpleasant wake-up call.

The apostle Peter offers us a different kind of wake-up call—one that
while unpleasant is necessary. He alerts us to a spiritual battle we
are engaged in with a powerful enemy. Peter warns, “Be sober, be
vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring
lion, seeking whom he may devour” (1 Peter 5:8). This is a call to
wake up, see the danger, and be ready for his attack!

Only when we are aware of the danger that faces us every day will we
consciously seek the help we need. And only if we are on the alert
will we lean on the strength of our Lord, who is greater than our
spiritual enemy.

Reflect & Pray

Though evil may surround us, We need not fear defeat; For when God
fights the battle, Our enemies retreat. —Sper

The Christian life is a battleground.
