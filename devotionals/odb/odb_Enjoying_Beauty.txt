Enjoying Beauty

He has made everything beautiful in its time.
Ecclesiastes 3:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 3:9–13

The painting caught my eye like a beacon. Displayed along a long
hallway in a big city hospital, its deep pastel hues and Navajo Native
American figures were so arresting I stopped to marvel and stare.
“Look at that,” I said to my husband, Dan.

He was walking ahead but I hesitated, bypassing other paintings on the
wall to gaze only at that one. “Beautiful,” I whispered.

Many things in life are beautiful indeed. Master paintings. Scenic
vistas. Inspired crafts. But so is a child’s smile. A friend’s hello.
A robin’s blue egg. A seashell’s strong ridges. To relieve the burdens
life can bring, “[God] has made everything beautiful in its time”
(Ecclesiastes 3:11). In such beauty, Bible scholars explain, we get a
glimpse of the perfection of God’s creation—including the glory of His
perfect rule to come.

We can only imagine such perfection, so God grants us a foretaste
through life’s beauty. In this way, God “has also set eternity in the
human heart” (v. 11). Some days life looks drab and futile. But God
mercifully provides moments of beauty to ponder.

The artist of the painting I admired, Gerard Curtis Delano, understood
that. “God [gave] me a talent to create beauty,” he once said, “and
this is what He wanted me to do.”

Seeing such beauty, how can we respond? We can thank God for eternity
to come while pausing to enjoy the glory we already see.

Reflect & Pray

How do you respond to the beauty God has placed in this world? How
does beauty reflect Him?

Father, help me in the moments of this day to see and enjoy the beauty
You bring into my life as I also look forward to eternity.
