Who Are You Defending?

At just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for
the ungodly.
Romans 5:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 10:13–16

When Kathleen’s teacher called her to the front of the grammar class
to analyze a sentence, she panicked. As a recent transfer student, she
hadn’t learned that aspect of grammar. The class laughed at her.

Instantly the teacher sprang to her defense. “She can out-write any of
you any day of the week!” he explained. Many years later, Kathleen
gratefully recalled the moment: “I started that day to try to write as
well as he said I could.” Eventually, Kathleen Parker would win a
Pulitzer Prize for her writing.

As did Kathleen’s teacher, Jesus identified with the defenseless and
vulnerable. When His disciples kept children away from Him, He grew
angry. “Let the little children come to me,” He said, “and do not
hinder them” (Mark 10:14). He reached out to a despised ethnic group,
making the Good Samaritan the hero of His parable (Luke 10:25–37) and
offering genuine hope to a searching Samaritan woman at Jacob’s well
(John 4:1–26). He protected and forgave a woman trapped in adultery
(John 8:1–11). And though we were utterly helpless, Christ gave His
life for all of us (Rom. 5:6).

When we defend the vulnerable and the marginalized, we give them a
chance to realize their potential. We show them real love, and in a
small but significant way we reflect the very heart of Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

Father, help me recognize the people in my life who need someone to
stand with them. Forgive me for thinking that it’s “not my problem.”
Help me to love others as You do.

It is impossible to love Christ without loving others.
