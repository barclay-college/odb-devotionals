The Gift of Encouragement

Joseph . . . whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “son of
encouragement”), sold a field he owned and brought the money and put
it at the apostles’ feet.
Acts 4:36–37

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 4:32–37; 9:26–27

An old Merle Haggard song, “If We Make It Through December,” tells the
story of a man laid off from his factory job with no money to buy
Christmas gifts for his little girl. Although December is supposed to
be a happy time of year, his life seems dark and cold.

Discouragement is not unique to December, but it can be amplified
then. Our expectations may be higher, our sadness deeper. A little
encouragement can go a long way.

Joseph, a man from Cyprus, was among the early followers of Jesus. The
apostles called him Barnabas, which means “son of encouragement.” We
meet him in Acts 4:36–37 when he sold a piece of property and donated
the money to help other believers in need.

Later, we read that the disciples were afraid of Saul (Acts 9:26).
“But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles” (v. 27). Saul,
later called Paul, had formerly been trying to kill the believers, but
Barnabas defended him as a man transformed by Christ.

All around us are people longing to be encouraged. A timely word, a
phone call, or a prayer can bolster their faith in Jesus.

The generosity and support of Barnabas demonstrate what it means to be
a son or daughter of encouragement. That may be the greatest gift we
can give to others this Christmas.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for the gift of encouragement. May we encourage
others as they have encouraged us.

Encouragement may be the greatest gift we give this Christmas.
