A Voice in the Night

Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the Lord! —
Psalm 134:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 134

Psalm 134 has only three verses, but it is proof that little things
can mean a lot. The first two verses are an admonition to the priests
who serve in God’s house night after night. The building was dark and
empty; nothing of consequence was occurring—or so it seemed. Yet these
ministers were encouraged to “lift up [their] hands to the holy place
and bless the Lord!” (v. 2 esv). The third verse is a voice from the
congregation calling into the darkness and loneliness of the night:
“The Lord who made heaven and earth bless you.”

I think of other servants of the Lord today—pastors and their families
who serve in small churches in small places. They’re often
discouraged, tempted to lose heart, doing their best, serving
unnoticed and unrewarded. They wonder if anyone cares what they’re
doing; if anyone ever thinks of them, prays for them, or considers
them a part of their lives.

I would say to them—and to anyone who is feeling lonely or
insignificant: Though your place is small, it is a holy place. The one
who made and moves heaven and earth is at work in and through you.
“Lift up your hands” and praise Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, show me how I can be an encourager of others who might feel they
are in a “small” place. Let them know that their lives leave an
eternal impact on those they serve.

Anyone doing God’s work in God’s way is important in His sight.
