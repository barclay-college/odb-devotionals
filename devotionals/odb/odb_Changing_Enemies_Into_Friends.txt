Changing Enemies Into Friends

But I say to you, love your enemies . . . do good to those who hate
you. —
Matthew 5:44

Today's Scripture: Matthew 5:43-48

During the US Civil War, hatred became entrenched between the North
and South. In one instance, President Abraham Lincoln was criticized
for speaking of benevolent treatment for the Southern rebels. The
critic reminded Lincoln that there was a war going on, the
Confederates were the enemy, and they should be destroyed. But Lincoln
wisely responded, “I destroy my enemies when I make them my friends.”

Lincoln’s comment is insightful. In many ways it reflects Jesus’
teaching in the Sermon on the Mount: “I say to you, love your enemies,
bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for
those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons
of your Father in heaven” (Matt. 5:44-45).

We will encounter difficult people in our lives—some on whom we will
need to set limits. But to give in to the temptation to undermine or
hurt them in any way is not God’s way. Instead, we should pray for
them, show consideration, look out for their best interests, and
emphasize the positive. This may result in changing an enemy into a
friend.

Not everyone will respond positively to us, but we can pray and plan
for a more harmonious relationship. What difficult person can you
start befriending?

Reflect & Pray

Lord, some people in my life are difficult to love. I am tempted not
even to try to care. But You showed love to me even when I was Your
enemy. Please direct me into ways to love with Your power and grace.

It’s hard to hate someone when you’re doing something good for him.
