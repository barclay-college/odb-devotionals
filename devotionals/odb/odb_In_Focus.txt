In Focus

By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made
strong.
Acts 3:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 3:2–8, 16

Author Mark Twain suggested that whatever we look at in life—and how
we see it—can influence our next steps, even our destiny. As Twain
said, “You can’t depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of
focus.”

Peter too spoke of vision when he replied to a lame beggar, a man whom
he and John encountered at the busy temple gate called Beautiful (Acts
3:2). As the man asked them for money, Peter and John looked directly
at the man. “Then Peter said, ‘Look at us!’ ” (v. 4).

Why did he say that? As Christ’s ambassador, Peter likely wanted the
beggar to stop looking at his own limitations—yes, even to stop
looking at his need for money. As he looked at the apostles, he would
see the reality of having faith in God.

As Peter told him, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I
give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk” (v. 6). Then
Peter “helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became
strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk” and give praise (vv.
7–8).

What happened? The man had faith in God (v. 16). As evangelist Charles
Spurgeon urged, “Keep your eye simply on Him.” When we do, we don’t
see obstacles. We see God, the One who makes our way clear.

Reflect & Pray

What are you focused on instead of God? With refocused faith, what
could you see in Him for your life?

Heavenly Father, when my eyes wander from You, focus my gaze on Your
unlimited power.
