When God Is Quiet

As [Elijah] lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an angel
touched him, and said to him, “Arise and eat.” —
1 Kings 19:5

Today's Scripture: 1 Kings 19:1-12

I love to take pictures of sunsets at Lake Michigan. Some are subtle
shades of pastel. Others are bold strokes of bright color. Sometimes
the sun sinks quietly behind the lake. Other times it goes down in
what looks like a fiery explosion.

In pictures and in person, I prefer the latter. But both show the
handiwork of God. When it comes to God’s work in the world, my
preferences are the same. I would rather see dramatic answers to
prayer than ordinary provisions of daily bread. But both are the work
of God.

Elijah may have had similar preferences. He had grown accustomed to
being the center of God’s grand displays of power. When he prayed, God
showed up in dramatic ways—first in a miraculous defeat against the
prophets of Baal and then in the end to a long and devastating drought
(1 Kings 18). But then Elijah felt afraid and started to run. God sent
an angel to feed him to strengthen him for his journey. After 40 days
he arrived in Horeb. God showed him that He was now communicating in a
still small voice, not in flashy miracles (19:11-12).

If you’re discouraged because God hasn’t shown up in a blaze of glory,
perhaps He’s revealing Himself with His quiet presence.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, may we see You today in the small details of life in ways that
we hadn’t noticed before. Thank You for the gift of Your quiet
presence, wherever we may find it today.

God is in the small things as well as the great.
