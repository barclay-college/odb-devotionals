Fly The Flag

Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. —
Ephesians 5:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 5:1-13

Queen Elizabeth II has reigned for more than 60 years. Her monarchy
has been characterized by grace and class. She has diligently given
her life to serve her people well, and as a result she is deeply loved
and highly revered. So, you can understand the importance of the flag
flying above Buckingham Palace. When the flag is flying, it means that
she is in residence in the heart of London. The flag is a public
statement that the queen is present with her people.

As I was thinking about that, it occurred to me that our King Jesus is
in residence in our hearts as our “never leave you nor forsake you”
Monarch (Heb. 13:5). As wonderful as that is to us personally, I
wonder if those around us would recognize that He is in residence
based on the way we live? If He is within us, that will show on the
outside. As Paul says, we are to be “imitators of God” and to “walk in
love, as Christ also has loved us” (Eph. 5:1-2). As we do so, we will
display joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, and self-control (Gal. 5:22-23).

So let’s fly the flag of His presence—the flag of His grace,
righteousness, and love—so that others may see Him through us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, remind me that Your presence in my heart is intended to be a
public reality. May I so value all the blessings of Your presence that
I am willing to share them generously with others.

Fly the flag of Christ’s presence to show that the King is in
residence in your life.
