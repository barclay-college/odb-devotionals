Shadowed

The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? —
Psalm 27:1

Today's Scripture: Jeremiah 42:1-12

Someone was shadowing me. In a darkened hallway, I turned the corner
to go up a flight of stairs and was alarmed by what I saw, stopping
dead in my tracks. It happened again a few days later. I came around
the back of a favorite coffee shop and saw the large shape of a person
coming at me. Both incidents ended with a smile, however. I’d been
frightened by my own shadow!

The prophet Jeremiah talked about the difference between real and
imagined fears. A group of his Jewish countrymen asked him to find out
whether the Lord wanted them to stay in Jerusalem or return to Egypt
for safety because they feared the king of Babylon (Jer. 42:1-3).
Jeremiah told them that if they stayed and trusted God, they didn’t
need to be afraid (vv.10-12). But if they returned to Egypt, the king
of Babylon would find them (vv.15-16).

In a world of real dangers, God had given Israel reason to trust Him
in Jerusalem. He had already rescued them from Egypt. Centuries later,
the long-awaited Messiah died for us to deliver us from our own sin
and fear of death. May our Almighty God show us today how to live in
the security of His shadow, rather than in shadowy fears of our own
making.

Reflect & Pray

Trust when your skies are darkening, Trust when your light grows dim,
Trust when the shadows gather, Trust and look up to Him. —Anon.

Under the protecting shadow of God’s wing, the little shadows of life
lose their terror.
