Unexpressed Gratitude

Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! . . . Let the redeemed of the
Lord say so. —
Psalm 107:1-2

Today's Scripture: Psalm 107:31-43

The whole reason for saying thanks is to let the giver of a gift know
how much you appreciate something. Author G. B. Stern once said,
“Silent gratitude isn’t much use to anyone.”

When our son was young, he sometimes needed to be reminded that
avoiding eye contact, looking down at his feet, and mumbling some
unintelligible words was not an acceptable “thank you.” And after many
years of marriage, my husband and I are still learning that it’s
important for us to continually express our gratitude to each other.
When one of us feels appreciative, we try to verbalize it—even if
we’ve said it many times before about the same thing. William Arthur
Ward said, “Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a
present and not giving it.”

Showing our gratitude is obviously important in human relationships,
but it’s even more essential in our relationship with God. As we think
about the many blessings we have received, do we express our thanks to
Him throughout the day? And when we think of the amazing gift of His
death and resurrection for forgiveness of our sins, do our hearts
bubble over with awe and thanksgiving? (Rom. 6:23; 2 Cor. 9:15).

Take the reminder in Psalm 107:1 to heart each day: “Give thanks to
the Lord, for He is good!”
