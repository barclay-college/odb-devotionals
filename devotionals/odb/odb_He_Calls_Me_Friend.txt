He Calls Me Friend

All things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you . . .
that you should go and bear fruit. —
John 15:15-16

Today's Scripture: John 15:9-17

Someone has defined friendship as “knowing the heart of another and
sharing one’s heart with another.” We share our hearts with those we
trust, and trust those who care about us. We confide in our friends
because we have confidence that they will use the information to help
us, not harm us. They in turn confide in us for the same reason.

We often refer to Jesus as our friend because we know that He wants
what is best for us. We confide in Him because we trust Him. But have
you ever considered that Jesus confides in His people?

Jesus began calling His disciples friends rather than servants because
He had entrusted them with everything He had heard from His Father
(John 15:15). Jesus trusted the disciples to use the information for
the good of His Father’s kingdom.

Although we know that Jesus is our friend, can we say that we are His
friends? Do we listen to Him? Or do we only want Him to listen to us?
Do we want to know what’s on His heart? Or do we only want to tell Him
what’s on ours? To be a friend of Jesus, we need to listen to what He
wants us to know and then use the information to bring others into
friendship with Him.

Sweet thought! We have a Friend above, Our weary, faltering steps to
guide, Who follows with His eye of love The precious child for whom He
died. —Anon.

Christ’s friendship calls for our faithfulness.
