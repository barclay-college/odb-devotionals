God’s World

The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness. —
Psalm 24:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 24

I knew my son would enjoy receiving a map of the world for his
birthday. After some shopping, I found a colorful chart of the
continents, which included illustrations in every region. A birdwing
butterfly hovered over Papua, New Guinea. Mountains cascaded through
Chile. A diamond adorned South Africa. I was delighted, but I wondered
about the label at the bottom of the map: Our World.

In one sense, the earth is our world because we live in it. We’re
allowed to drink its water, mine its gold, and fish its seas—but only
because God has given us the go-ahead (Gen. 1:28-30). Really, it’s
God’s World. “The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness, the world
and those who dwell therein” (Ps. 24:1). It amazes me that God has
entrusted His incredible creation to mere humans. He knew that some of
us would mistreat it, deny He made it, and claim it as ours. Still, He
allows us to call it home and sustains it through His Son (Col.
1:16-17).

Today, take a moment to enjoy life in God’s world. Savor the taste of
some fruit. Eavesdrop on a bird and listen to its song. Revel in a
sunset. Let the world you inhabit inspire you to worship the One who
owns it.

Reflect & Pray

Help me, Lord, to stop occasionally. To look, to listen, to taste, to
think about the gifts You send for our enjoyment. Thank You for
expressing Your creativity and love to me today.

The beauty of creation gives us reasons to sing God’s praise.
