Living Sacrifice

I urge you . . . in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a
living sacrifice.
Romans 12:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 12:1–8

My great aunt had an exciting job in advertising and traveled between
Chicago and New York City. But she chose to give up that career out of
love for her parents. They lived in Minnesota and needed to be cared
for. Both of her brothers had died young in tragic circumstances and
she was her mom and dad’s only remaining child. For her, serving her
parents was an expression of her faith.

The apostle Paul’s letter to the church at Rome urged Christian
believers to be “a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God” (Romans
12:1). He hoped they would extend Christ’s sacrificial love to each
other. And he asked them not to think of themselves more highly than
they should (v. 3). When they fell into disagreements and division, he
called them to lay down their pride, because “in Christ we, though
many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others” (v.
5). He yearned that they would show each other sacrificial love.

Each day we have the opportunity to serve others. For instance, we
might let someone go ahead of us in a line or we might, like my great
aunt, care for someone who is ill. Or maybe we share from our
experience as we give another advice and direction. When we offer
ourselves as living sacrifices, we honor God.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus Christ, You humbled Yourself and lay down Your life that I
might live. May I never forget this most precious gift of grace and
love.

When we serve others in His name, we please God.
