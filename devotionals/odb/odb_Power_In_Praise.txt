Power In Praise

Praise the Lord, for His mercy endures forever. —
2 Chronicles 20:21

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 20:15-22

Willie Myrick was kidnapped from his driveway when he was 9 years old.
For hours, he traveled in a car with his kidnapper, not knowing what
would happen to him. During that time, Willie decided to sing a song
called “Every Praise.” As he repeatedly sang the words, his abductor
spewed profanity and told him to shut up. Finally, the man stopped the
car and let Willie out—unharmed.

As Willie demonstrated, truly praising the Lord requires us to
concentrate on God’s character while forsaking what we fear, what is
wrong in our lives, and the self-sufficiency in our hearts.

The Israelites reached this place of surrender when they faced
attackers. As they prepared for battle, King Jehoshaphat organized a
choir to march out in advance of their enemy’s army. The choir sang,
“Praise the Lord, for His mercy endures forever” (2 Chron. 20:21).
When the music started, Israel’s enemies became confused and destroyed
each other. As the prophet Jahaziel had predicted, Israel didn’t need
to fight at all (v.17).

Whether we’re facing a battle or feeling trapped, we can glorify God
in our hearts. Truly, “The Lord is great and greatly to be praised”
(Ps. 96:4).
