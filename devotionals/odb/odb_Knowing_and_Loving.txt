Knowing and Loving

My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
John 10:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 10:7–16

“Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so” is the
message of one of Christian music’s most enduring songs, particularly
for children. Written by Anna B. Warner in the 1800s, this lyric
tenderly affirms our relationship with Him—we are loved.

Someone gave my wife a plaque for our home that gives these words a
fresh twist by flipping that simple idea. It reads, “Jesus knows me,
this I love.” This provides a different perspective on our
relationship with Him—we are known.

In ancient Israel, loving and knowing the sheep distinguished a true
shepherd from a hired hand. The shepherd spent so much time with his
sheep that he developed an abiding care for and a deep knowledge of
his lambs. Little wonder then that Jesus tells His own, “I am the good
shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me. . . . My sheep listen
to my voice; I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:14, 27).

He knows us and He loves us! We can trust Jesus’s purposes for us and
rest in the promise of His care because His Father “knows what [we]
need before [we] ask him” (Matthew 6:8). As you deal with the ups and
downs of life today, be at rest. You are known and loved by the
Shepherd of your heart.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for how You tenderly love and care for me. Help
me to trust You in all areas of my life.

The wonder of it all—just to think that Jesus loves me!
