The Smells Of The Stable

They shall call His name Immanuel, which is translated, “God with us.”
—
Matthew 1:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:15-20

A stable? What a place to give birth to the Messiah! The smells and
sounds of a barnyard were our Savior’s first human experience. Like
other babies, He may even have cried at the sounds of the animals and
the strangers parading around His temporary crib.

If so, they would have been the first of many tears. Jesus would come
to know human loss and sorrow, the doubts his brothers and family had
about Him, and the pain His mother experienced as she saw Him tortured
and killed.

All these hardships—and so much more—awaited the baby trying to sleep
that first night. Yet from His very first moments, Jesus was “God with
us” (Matt. 1:23), and He knew what it meant to be human. This would
continue for over three decades, ending at His death on the cross.

Because of His love for you and me, Jesus became fully human. And
being human allows Him to identify with us. Never again can we say
that no one understands us. Jesus does.

May the Light that entered the world that night cast its brilliance
into the deepest corners of our souls this Christmas, giving us the
peace on Earth of which the angels spoke so long ago.
