Letter To A Child

I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. —
3 John 4

Today's Scripture: 3 John

Even at the end of his life, C. S. Lewis showed an interest in the
spiritual nurture of younger believers. Although in ill health, he
took time to respond to the letter of a child named Philip.
Complimenting the boy’s fine written expression, Lewis said he was
delighted that Philip understood that in the Narnia Chronicles the
lion Aslan represented Jesus Christ. The next day, Lewis died at his
home in the Kilns, Oxford, England, one week before his 65th birthday.

The apostle John, in his later years, sent a letter to his spiritual
children. In it we see the joy of a mature believer encouraging his
spiritually younger disciples to keep walking in the truth and
following Christ.

John wrote, “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk
in truth” (3 John 1:4). Short by New Testament standards, John’s
letter demonstrates the joy that comes in nurturing and watching the
next generation’s spiritual growth.

Encouraging spiritual understanding in the next generation should be
the pursuit of mature believers. Sending a note of appreciation,
giving a word of encouragement, praying, or offering sound advice can
all be ways of helping others on their spiritual journey with God.

Reflect & Pray

To help another in Christ to grow You have to pay a price It takes the
giving of yourself And that means sacrifice. —D. DeHaan

The journey is better with someone who knows the way.
