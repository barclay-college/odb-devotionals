A Memorial

As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord’s death till He comes. —
1 Corinthians 11:26

Today's Scripture: 1 Cor. 11:23-30

The Taj Mahal in India is a magnificent mausoleum. Built entirely of
white marble, it was commissioned by the Emperor Shah Jehan in memory
of his wife, who died suddenly. It took 22 years to complete. Millions
of tourists visit this memorial annually in order to see this grand
structure the emperor ordered to be built in memory of the woman he
loved.

Millions of people also throng to Jerusalem to look at another site—a
tomb that some say may have been where Jesus was buried. No matter
what tomb He lay in, Jesus occupied it for only a few days. It has
been empty for 2,000 years.

Jesus doesn’t need us to build a memorial to Him. Instead, He gave us
the Lord’s Supper (communion) as a memorial to remember Him. On the
night He was betrayed, Jesus took bread and the cup and gave thanks to
His Father before offering them to His disciples (Luke 22:14-21). Each
time we partake of those elements in church, we are first to examine
ourselves and our relationship with God (1 Cor. 11:28). “As often as
[we] eat this bread and drink this cup” we are to do so in remembrance
of the One we love, till He comes (vv.25-26).

The Lord has given us an enduring memorial to remind us of what He has
done for us.

Reflect & Pray

I’ll take the bread and cup, dear Lord, That speak of love sublime,
And give myself afresh to Thee. My life, my all is Thine! —Anon.

The Lord’s Supper—Christ’s memorial that He left for us.
