Best Friend—Forever

“Abraham believed God . . . ,” and he was called God’s friend.
James 2:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 2:18–26

One of the pieces of wisdom I have come to appreciate is my dad’s
often-repeated statement, “Joe, good friends are one of life’s
greatest treasures.” How true! With good friends, you are never alone.
They’re attentive to your needs and gladly share life’s joys and
burdens.

Before Jesus came to earth, only two individuals were called friends
of God. The Lord spoke to Moses “as one speaks to a friend” (Ex.
33:11), and Abraham “was called God’s friend” (James 2:23; see 2
Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8).

I am amazed that Jesus calls those of us who belong to Him friends: “I
have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father
I have made known to you” (John 15:15). And His friendship is so deep
that He laid down His life for us. John says, “Greater love has no one
than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends” (v. 13).

What a privilege and blessing to have Jesus as our friend! He is a
friend who will never leave us or forsake us. He intercedes for us
before the Father and supplies all our needs. He forgives all our
sins, understands all our sorrows, and gives us sufficient grace in
times of trouble. He is indeed our best friend!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I am thankful that You have called me Your friend. May I ever be
grateful for the privilege!

What a friend we have in Jesus.
