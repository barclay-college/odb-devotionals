Fresh And Flourishing

They shall be fresh and flourishing. —
Psalm 92:14

Today's Scripture: Psalm 92

In Psalm 92, the poet begins with a commendation of praise: “It is
good to give thanks to the Lord.” Good for what? Good for you and me.
It does our soul a world of good to turn from anxious thoughts and
fill our days with prayerful praise; good to greet each morning with
songs of thanksgiving, for such praise makes us glad. It lifts us out
of gloom and replaces our sadness with cheerful songs at the “works of
[His] hands” (v.4). And what is that work? The work He is doing in us!

Here’s one of my most cherished metaphors: “The righteous shall
flourish like a palm tree, he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Those who are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the
courts of our God. They shall still bear fruit in old age; they shall
be fresh and flourishing” (vv.12-14).

Palms are symbols of towering beauty and cedars of unbending strength.
These are the characteristics of those who have been “planted in the
house of the Lord” (v.13). Their roots go down into the soil of God’s
unquenchable love.

Do you think your usefulness to God is over? Continue in God’s Word,
rooted and grounded in Christ, drinking in His love and faithfulness.
Then, no matter your age, you will bear fruit and be “fresh and
flourishing.”
