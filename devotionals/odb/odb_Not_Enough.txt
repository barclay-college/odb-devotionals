Not Enough

What profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself
destroyed or lost? —
Luke 9:25

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 2:1-16

The writer of Ecclesiastes said that pleasure, material possessions,
and even great knowledge do not bring lasting satisfaction. Jesus went
even further. He said that a person who possesses everything this
world has to offer but doesn’t prepare for eternity is spiritually
destitute. We all need more than fun, finances, and fame to be
fulfilled.

Thinking about this made me consider some prominent people who had
committed suicide. One was a baseball star, several were entertainers,
and two had inherited great wealth. I also recalled a highly esteemed
scholar and his wife who both took a lethal overdose of drugs when
they learned that she had terminal cancer. These people had failed to
find meaning in their existence.

Because we were created in God’s image, our lives do have meaning for
both time and eternity. God made us for His glory and placed us on
earth to honor Him. We have the remarkable ability to reflect on Him
and on eternity.

Believing that Jesus died for our sins and rose from the grave meets
our need for meaning. Salvation brings assurance that we’re forgiven.
We have an eternal purpose and the hope of heaven. This is enough to
bring deep peace and joy to our lives. Have you found this to be so?
