Forgiven!

I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek your servant.
Psalm 119:176

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 1:1-10

My friend Norm Cook sometimes had a surprise for his family when he
arrived home from work. He would walk through the front door, and
shout, “You’re forgiven!” It wasn’t that family members had wronged
him and needed his forgiveness. He was reminding them that though they
doubtless had sinned throughout the day, they were by God’s grace
fully forgiven.

The apostle John supplies this note about grace: “If we walk in the
light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and
the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin. If we claim to
be without sin [no inclination to sin], we deceive ourselves and the
truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just
and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness”
(1 John 1:7–9).

To “walk in the light” is a metaphor for following Jesus. Imitating
Jesus with the Spirit’s help, John insists, is the sign that we have
joined with the apostles in the fellowship of faith. We are authentic
Christians. But, he continues, let’s not be deceived: We will make
wrong choices at times. Nevertheless, grace is given in full measure:
We can take what forgiveness we need.

Not perfect; just forgiven by Jesus! That’s the good word for today.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I know I’m not even close to being perfect. That’s why I need
You and Your cleansing in my life. I’m lost without You.

Monitor your heart daily to avoid wandering from God’s wisdom.
