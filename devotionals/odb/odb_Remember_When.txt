Remember When

The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.
Psalm 126:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 126

Our son wrestled with drug addiction for seven years, and during that
time my wife and I experienced many difficult days. As we prayed and
waited for his recovery, we learned to celebrate small victories. If
nothing bad happened in a twenty-four-hour period, we would tell each
other, “Today was a good day.” That short sentence became a reminder
to be thankful for God’s help with the smallest things.

Tucked away in Psalm 126:3 is an even better reminder of God’s tender
mercies and what they ultimately mean for us: “The Lord has done great
things for us, and we are filled with joy.” What a great verse to take
to heart as we remember Jesus’s compassion for us at the cross! The
difficulties of any given day cannot change the truth that come what
may, our Lord has already shown us unfathomable kindness, and “his
love endures forever” (Ps. 136:1).

When we have lived through a difficult circumstance and discovered
that God was faithful, keeping that in mind helps greatly the next
time life’s waters turn rough. We may not know how God will get us
through our circumstances, but His kindness to us in the past helps us
trust that He will.

Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end, our Maker, Defender,
Redeemer, and Friend. Robert Grant

When we cannot see God’s hand, we can trust His heart.
