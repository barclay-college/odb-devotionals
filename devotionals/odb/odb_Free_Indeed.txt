Free Indeed

If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
John 8:36

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 8:31–37

Olaudah Equiano (c. 1745–1796) was only 11 years old when he was
kidnapped and sold into slavery. He made the harrowing journey from
West Africa to the West Indies, then to the colony of Virginia, and
then to England. By the age of 20 he purchased his own freedom, still
bearing the emotional and physical scars of the inhumane treatment he
had experienced.

Unable to enjoy his own freedom while others were still enslaved,
Equiano became active in the movement to abolish slavery in England.
He wrote his autobiography (an unheard of achievement for a former
slave in that era) in which he described the horrific treatment of the
enslaved.

When Jesus came, He fought a battle for all of us who are enslaved and
unable to fight for ourselves. Our slavery is not one of outward
chains. We are held by our own brokenness and sin. Jesus said,
“Everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent
place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son
sets you free, you will be free indeed” (John 8:34–36).

Wherever such a freedom seems unheard of, His words need to be
declared. We can be liberated from our guilt, shame, and hopelessness.
By trusting Jesus, we can be free indeed!

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord Jesus, for making the sacrifice that has secured my
freedom and eternal life. May I learn to love You in a way that honors
the love You have shown me.

The price of our freedom from sin was paid by Jesus’s blood.
