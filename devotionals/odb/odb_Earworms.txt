Earworms

If there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate
on these things. —
Philippians 4:8

Today's Scripture: Philippians 4:4-9

They burrow. They bore in. They attach themselves inside your head.
Earworms, a term once used exclusively for insects, is now the name
for those unrelenting tunes that you can’t get out of your head. Songs
like, “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” the “Barney” song, or my personal
nightmare: “It’s a Small World After All.”

They say the only way to rid yourself of the insidious infestation is
to replace it with another tune—your “cleaner” song. New words and a
fresh tune can crowd out the old.

Maybe we could use a cleaner song for our thought-life as well. When
lustful or vengeful thoughts creep into our minds, reading and
meditating on God’s Word can help to clean up our thinking.

Scripture tells us to love the Lord “with all [our] heart, with all
[our] soul, and with all [our] mind” (Matt. 22:37) and not to “be
conformed to this world” but to “be transformed by the renewing of
[our] mind” (Rom. 12:2). It instructs us to think about things that
are true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, and
praiseworthy (Phil. 4:8).

When our minds wander to evil, the best “cleaner” is to allow the
wisdom of the Bible to permeate our thoughts and hearts (2 Tim. 3:16).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, our desire is to spend time in Your Word. We know that
meditating on Your Word fills our minds with thoughts of You and helps
to keep our thinking from wandering to evil. Help us to do so.

Character is the sum total of all our thoughts, words, and deeds.
