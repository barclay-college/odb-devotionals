Complete Access

Through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
Ephesians 3:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 3:7–13

A few years ago, a friend invited me to join him as a spectator at a
pro golf tournament. Being a first-timer, I had no idea what to
expect. When we arrived, I was surprised to receive gifts,
information, and maps of the golf course. But what topped it all was
that we gained access to a VIP tent behind the 18th green, where we
had free food and a place to sit. I couldn’t have gained entry to the
hospitality tent on my own though. The key was my friend; it was only
through him that I had complete access.

Left to ourselves, we would all be hopelessly separated from God. But
Jesus, who took our penalty, offers us His life and access to God. The
apostle Paul wrote, “[God’s] intent was that now, through the church,
the manifold wisdom of God should be made known” (Eph. 3:10). This
wisdom has brought Jew and Gentile together in Christ, who has made a
way for us to come to God the Father. “Through faith in [Christ] we
may approach God with freedom and confidence” (v. 12).

When we put our trust in Jesus, we receive the greatest access of
all—access to the God who loves us and desires relationship with us.

Reflect & Pray

Father! Just being able to call You Father is an incredible gift.
Thank You for Your Son, Jesus, who has made it possible for me to come
into Your presence, to know You personally, and, yes, to call You my
Father.

Because of the cross of Christ, we can become friends of God.
