Good for You?

You are good, and what you do is good; teach me your decrees.
Psalm 119:68

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:65–72

Because I like dark chocolate, I once Googled “Is dark chocolate good
for you?” I got a variety of results—some good, some bad. You can do
the same for almost any food product. Is milk good for you? Is coffee
good for you? Is rice good for you? There is a dizzying array of
answers to these questions, so you have to be aware that the search
itself may not be good for you. It may give you a headache!

But if you’re looking for something that’s one-hundred percent good
for you all the time, can I recommend the Word of God? Listen to what
it can do for the follower of Jesus who is seeking to build
a relationship with God.

It can keep you pure (Psalm 119:9, 11).

It blesses you (Luke 11:28).

It makes you wise (Matthew 7:24).

It gives light and understanding (Psalm 119:130).

It helps you grow spiritually (1 Peter 2:2).

Our God is good: “The Lord is good to all,” says Psalm 145:9. And in
His goodness, He’s provided those who love Him with a guide that helps
us see how to enhance our relationship with Him. As we try to decide
how to live in a world full of choices, praise God that He’s told us
in Scripture what’s good for us. Let’s say with the psalm-writer: “How
sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth”
(Psalm 119:103).
