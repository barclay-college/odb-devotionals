Running and Rest

[Jesus] said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and
get some rest.”
Mark 6:31

Today's Scripture: Mark 6:30–46

The headline caught my eye: “Rest Days Important for Runners.” In
Tommy Manning’s article, the former member of the U.S. Mountain
Running Team emphasized a principle that dedicated athletes sometimes
ignore—the body needs time to rest and rebuild after exercise.
“Physiologically, the adaptations that occur as a result of training
only happen during rest,” Manning wrote. “This means rest is as
important as workouts.”

The same is true in our walk of faith and service. Regular times of
rest are essential to avoid burnout and discouragement. Jesus sought
spiritual balance during His life on Earth, even in the face of great
demands. When His disciples returned from a strenuous time of teaching
and healing others, “He said to them, ‘Come with me by yourselves to a
quiet place and get some rest’” (Mark 6:31). But a large crowd
followed them, so Jesus taught them and fed them with only five loaves
and two fish (vv. 32–44). When everyone was gone, Jesus “went up on a
mountainside to pray” (v. 46).

If our lives are defined by work, then what we do becomes less and
less effective. Jesus invites us to regularly join Him in a quiet
place to pray and get some rest.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, thank You for Your example of prayer alone with Your
Father. Give us wisdom and determination to make rest a priority as we
follow You.

In our life of faith and service, rest is as important as work.
