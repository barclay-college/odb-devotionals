The Power Of Affirmation

I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was
given to you by Christ Jesus. —
1 Corinthians 1:4

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 1:4-9

During a recent study, 200,000 employees were interviewed to discover
the missing ingredient in their productivity. The study concluded that
appreciation and affirmation topped the list of what they wanted most
from their superiors. This research implies that receiving affirmation
is a basic human need.

The apostle Paul seemed to realize this basic need in the Corinthian
believers, so before he peppered them with firm words of discipline,
he showered them with affirmation. As their spiritual leader, Paul
began his letter with thanksgiving to God for the grace being
displayed in their lives.

Once far from God, these believers were now participating in His grace
through the death and resurrection of Christ. United with Jesus, they
were drawing their spiritual life from Him, and the fruit of this
union was their spiritual growth in godliness (1 Cor. 1:4-7). Paul
deliberately and continually thanked God for His work in the
Corinthian believers’ lives. I imagine that they were better able to
bear firm criticism from Paul because of his tender affirmation.

When we see people who are obeying God, let’s take time to affirm them
and to thank God for what He’s doing through them.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You are at work in so many ways in my life and in the people
around me. Help me to encourage my brothers and sisters in Christ by
telling them how I am blessed to see Your work in them.

Praise loudly—correct softly.
