Becoming

Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
—
Luke 2:52

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:41-52

I grew up in a small town. No famous people. No busy streets. Not much
to do. Yet I’ve always been thankful for my quiet, uncomplicated
upbringing.

One evening when my husband and I were attending a business dinner, a
new acquaintance asked me where I was from. When I told her, she said,
“Aren’t you embarrassed to admit it?”

Unsure whether or not she was joking, I simply said, “No.”

Although my town was sometimes belittled for its lack of
sophistication, it was not lacking in things that matter. My family
was part of a church community in which parents brought up children
“in the training and admonition of the Lord” (Eph. 6:4).

Jesus also grew up in a small town: Nazareth. A man named Nathanael
asked, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” (John 1:46). Jesus
proved that the answer is yes. Even though He grew up in an
insignificant place, He was the most significant person in all of
history.

Experience taught me and Scripture confirms that what matters is not
where you grow up but how you grow up. Sometimes we feel insignificant
compared to sophisticated people from prominent places. But we are
significant to God, and He can make us strong in spirit and filled
with His wisdom.

Reflect & Pray

O teach me what it cost You, Lord, To make a sinner whole; And help me
understand anew The value of one soul! —Anon.

What we become is more important than where we’re from.
