Restored By The Master

[You] have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to
the image of Him who created him. —
Colossians 3:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:8-17

Over the centuries, many attempts have been made to restore damaged
and time-worn masterpieces of art. While some of these efforts have
skillfully preserved the original work of artists, others have
actually damaged many works of genius, including ancient Greek statues
and at least two paintings by da Vinci.

In Paul’s letter to the Christians at Colosse, he described a
restoration process that is impossible in the world of art. It’s a
restoration of God’s people. Paul wrote, “You have put off the old man
with his deeds, and have put on the new man who is renewed in
knowledge according to the image of Him who created him” (Col.
3:9-10). This is no attempt at renovating the work of a deceased
artist. It is a spiritual renewal from the living God who created us
and gave us new life in His Son, Jesus Christ. His forgiveness
brightens the colors of our lives while His grace sharpens the lines
of His purpose for us.

The canvas of our lives is in the skilled hands of our Lord who knows
who and what He designed us to be. No matter how sin-damaged and dirty
we may be, there is hope for renewal and restoration. The Master
Artist is alive and at work within us.

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven, To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Evermore His praises sing. —Lyte

Jesus specializes in restoration.
