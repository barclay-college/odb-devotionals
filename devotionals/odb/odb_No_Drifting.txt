No Drifting

We must pay the most careful attention . . . so that we do not drift
away.
Hebrews 2:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 2:1–4

At the end of one school semester, my wife and I picked up our
daughter from her school 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. On our way
back home we detoured to a nearby beach resort for snacks. While
enjoying our time there, we watched the boats at the seashore. Usually
they are anchored to prevent them from drifting away, but I noticed
one boat drifting unhindered among the others—slowly and steadily
making its way out to sea.

As we drove home, I reflected on the timely caution given to believers
in the book of Hebrews: “We must pay the most careful attention,
therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away” (Heb.
2:1). We have good reason to stay close. The author of Hebrews says
that while the Mosaic law was reliable and needed to be obeyed, the
message of the Son of God is far superior. Our salvation is  “so
great” in Jesus that He shouldn’t be ignored (v. 3).

Drifting in our relationship with God is hardly noticeable at first;
it happens gradually. However, spending time talking with Him in
prayer and reading His Word, confessing our wrongs to Him, and
interacting with other followers of Jesus can help us stay anchored in
Him. As we connect with the Lord regularly, He will be faithful to
sustain us, and we can avoid drifting away.
