Eyes Tightly Shut

They hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
Genesis 3:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 3:1–10

He knew he shouldn’t have done it. I could clearly see he knew it was
wrong: it was written all over his face! As I sat down to discuss his
wrongdoing with him, my nephew quickly squeezed his eyes shut. There
he sat, thinking—with three-year-old logic—that if he couldn’t see me,
then I must not be able to see him. And if he was invisible to me,
then he could avoid the conversation (and consequences) he
anticipated.

I’m so glad I could see him in that moment. While I couldn’t condone
his actions, and we needed to talk about it, I really didn’t want
anything to come between us. I wanted him to look fully into my face
and see how much I love him and was eager to forgive him! In that
moment, I caught a glimmer of how God might have felt when Adam and
Eve broke His trust in the garden of Eden. Realizing their guilt, they
tried to hide from God (Genesis 3:10), who could “see” them as plainly
as I could see my nephew.

When we realize we’ve done something wrong, we often want to avoid the
consequences. We run from it, conceal it, or close our eyes to the
truth. While God will hold us accountable to His righteous standard,
He sees us (and seeks us!) because He loves us and offers forgiveness
through Jesus Christ.
