Growing in the Wind

Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!
Mark 4:41

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 4:36–41

Imagine a world without wind. Lakes would be calm. Falling leaves
wouldn’t blow in the streets. But in still air, who would expect trees
to suddenly fall over? That’s what happened in a three-acre glass dome
built in the Arizona desert. Trees growing inside a huge windless
bubble called Biosphere 2 grew faster than normal until suddenly
collapsing under their own weight. Project researchers eventually came
up with an explanation. These trees needed wind stress to grow strong.

Jesus let His disciples experience gale-force winds to strengthen
their faith (Mark 4:36–41). During a night crossing of familiar
waters, a sudden storm proved too much even for these seasoned
fishermen. Wind and waves were swamping their boat while an exhausted
Jesus slept in the stern. In a panic they woke Him. Didn’t it bother
their Teacher that they were about to die? What was He thinking? Then
they began to find out. Jesus told the wind and waves to be quiet—and
asked His friends why they still had no faith in Him.

If the wind had not blown, these disciples would never have asked,
“Who is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!” (Mark 4:41).

Today, life in a protective bubble might sound good. But how strong
would our faith be if we couldn’t discover for ourselves His
reassuring “be still” when the winds of circumstance howl?
