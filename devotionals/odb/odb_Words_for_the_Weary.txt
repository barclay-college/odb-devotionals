Words for the Weary

The Sovereign Lord has given me a well-instructed tongue, to know the
word that sustains the weary.
Isaiah 50:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 50:4–10

A few days after his father died, 30-year-old C. S. Lewis received a
letter from a woman who had cared for his mother during her illness
and death more than two decades earlier. The woman offered her
sympathy for his loss and wondered if he remembered her. “My dear
Nurse Davison,” Lewis replied. “Remember you? I should think I do.”

Lewis recalled how much her presence in their home had meant to him as
well as to his brother and father during a difficult time. He thanked
her for her words of sympathy and said, “It is really comforting to be
taken back to those old days. The time during which you were with my
mother seemed very long to a child and you became part of home.”

When we struggle in the circumstances of life, an encouraging word
from others can lift our spirits and our eyes to the Lord. The Old
Testament prophet Isaiah wrote, “The Sovereign Lord has given me a
well-instructed tongue, to know the word that sustains the weary”
(50:4). And when we look to the Lord, He offers words of hope and
light in the darkness.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, help me to hear Your word of hope today. And help me
to speak words of hope and encouragement to others, pointing them to
You.

Kind words can lift a heavy heart.
