Side By Side

You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of
them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you
lie down, and when you rise up. —
Deuteronomy 6:7

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 6:1-9

In my family scrapbook is a picture of my daughter at age 4 working
next to me, using a toy hammer to repair the siding on the house. Side
by side we worked that day; she imitated my every action, absolutely
convinced that she too was fixing the house. Rarely have I enjoyed a
chore more. In the picture, it’s obvious that she’s enjoying it too.

That photo reminds me that our children mimic most of what they see in
us—words and deeds. They also form their images of God from the images
they have of us as parents. If we’re stern and unmerciful, they’re
likely to see God that way too. If we’re distant and cold, so God will
seem to them as well. It is one of our most important duties as
parents to help our children see God clearly, especially the
unconditional nature of His love.

I can imagine the family scrapbook of my relationship with God having
a similar picture. I’m learning from Him how to live life, how to
love, and how to make it a permanent part of my being. He then teaches
me how to teach others (Deut. 6:1-7).

May the Lord grant us an understanding of Him and the wisdom to pass
it on.

Reflect & Pray

We must teach our children clearly What is right and what is wrong;
Live before them an example— Godly, righteous, pure, and strong.
—Fitzhugh

To teach your children well, let God teach you.
