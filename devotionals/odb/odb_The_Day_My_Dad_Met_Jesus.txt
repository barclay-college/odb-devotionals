The Day My Dad Met Jesus

I obtained mercy . . . as a pattern to those who are going to believe
on Him for everlasting life. —
1 Timothy 1:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Timothy 1:15-17

My grandfather, my father, and his brothers were all tough men who,
understandably, didn’t appreciate people who “got up in their faces
about faith.” When my father, Howard, was diagnosed with a rapid and
deadly cancer, I was so concerned that I took every opportunity to
talk to him about Jesus’ love. Inevitably he would end the discussion
with a polite but firm: “I know what I need to know.”

I promised not to raise the issue again and gave him a set of cards
that shared the forgiveness God offers, which he could read when he
wanted. I entrusted Dad to God and prayed. A friend also asked God to
keep my dad alive long enough to know Jesus.

One afternoon the call came telling me Dad was gone. When my brother
met me at the airport, he said, “Dad told me to tell you he asked
Jesus to forgive his sin.” “When?” “The morning he passed,” Mark
replied. God had shown him “mercy” as He had shown us (1 Tim. 1:16).

Sometimes we talk about the gospel, other times we share our story,
still other times we just show a silent Christlike example, and always
we pray. We know that salvation is ultimately a work of God and not
something we can do for another. God is a gracious God, and no matter
what the outcome of our prayers, He can be trusted.

Reflect & Pray

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling— Calling for you and for me;
Patiently Jesus is waiting and watching— Watching for you and for me!
—Thompson

We plant and water, but God gives the increase.
