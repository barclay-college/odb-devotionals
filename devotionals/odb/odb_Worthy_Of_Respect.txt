Worthy Of Respect

Receive [Epaphroditus] therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and
hold such men in esteem. —
Phil. 2:29

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:19-30

Just before kickoff at Super Bowl XLIII, Kurt Warner of the Arizona
Cardinals received the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award—a
tribute given to the player who had best combined on-field excellence
with off-field community service. “I am humbled the Lord has given me
such an amazing life to impact others,” said Warner, a dedicated
Christian. “Of all the awards given to NFL athletes, [this one] stands
out . . . because of what it represents.” It represents a commitment
to giving and sacrificing for others.

Paying homage to those who serve is not a new concept. Paul spoke of
it when he reminded the Philippians to honor those who gave themselves
in serving Christ. He told them of their friend Epaphroditus, who had
nearly died (Phil. 2:30) because of his efforts for Christ in
ministering to others—including the people at Philippi. How should
they respond? Paul said, “Receive him therefore in the Lord with all
gladness, and hold such men in esteem” (v.29). Clearly, when we think
of those who sacrifice in serving the Savior, they are worthy of our
respect and appreciation.

Why not look for ways to show gratitude to those who have served you
spiritually. Give them the honor they deserve.

To honor is to show respect, To meet another’s need, To give someone
encouragement, To love in word and deed. —Sper

We honor God when we honor those who serve God.
