They Are Watching

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works
and glorify your Father in heaven. —
Matthew 5:16

Today's Scripture: Matthew 5:13-16

A professional football player’s team was having a terrible season,
losing week after week. A reporter asked him how he stayed motivated
to play hard and give his best even though his team lost almost every
game. He responded, “My dad is watching that game. My mom is watching
that game. You better believe I’m going to do my best!” He recognized
that there was more at stake than just winning or losing. People were
watching, and that reality always drove him to do his best.

Jesus reminded us of this reality in the early portions of His Sermon
on the Mount. We should live our lives with a recognition that what we
do is observed by those around us—and this visible life makes a
statement about our God. He said, “Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven”
(Matt. 5:16). How does the light of our lives shine? By bringing the
heart and character of Christ into the situations that engage us every
day. By showing compassion as He did for the marginalized or
forgotten. By displaying concern for the Father’s name and reputation.

People are watching us. The question is, What do they see?

Reflect & Pray

Show me the way, Lord, let my light shine As an example of good to
mankind. Help them to see the patterns of Thee, Shining in beauty,
lived out in me. —Neuer

Let your light shine—whether you’re a candle in a corner or a
lighthouse on a hill.
