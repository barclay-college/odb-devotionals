Love Changes Us

At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of
God.
Acts 9:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 9:1–22

Before I met Jesus, I’d been wounded so deeply that I avoided close
relationships in fear of being hurt more. My mom remained my closest
friend, until I married Alan. Seven years later and on the verge of
divorce, I toted our kindergartner, Xavier, into a church service. I
sat near the exit door, afraid to trust but desperate for help.

Thankfully, believers reached out, prayed for our family, and taught
me how to nurture a relationship with God through prayer and Bible
reading. Over time, the love of Christ and His followers changed me.

Two years after that first church service, Alan, Xavier, and I asked
to be baptized. Sometime later, during one of our weekly
conversations, my mom said, “You’re different. Tell me more about
Jesus.” A few months passed and she too accepted Christ as her Savior.

Jesus transforms lives . . . lives like Saul’s, one of the most feared
persecutors of the church until his encounter with Christ (Acts
9:1–5). Others helped Saul learn more about Jesus (vv. 17–19). His
drastic transformation added to the credibility of his Spirit-
empowered teaching (vv. 20–22).

Our first personal encounter with Jesus may not be as dramatic as
Saul’s. Our life transformation may not be as quick or drastic. Still,
as people notice how Christ’s love is changing us over time, we’ll
have opportunities to tell others what He did for us.
