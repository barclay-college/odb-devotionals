A Father’s Invitation

Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed,
and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. —
Ezekiel 18:31

Today's Scripture: Ezekiel 18:25-32

The Old Testament book of Ezekiel tells of God’s judgment on His
disobedient people. The Lord called them “a rebellious nation that has
rebelled against Me” (2:3) and “impudent and stubborn children” (v.4).
The graphic descriptions of their sin and the violent images of their
coming punishment are appalling. Yet in the darkest moments of God’s
lament over His people held captive in Babylon, His love shines
through in His call for them to walk again on the path of life.

“ ‘Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed,
and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you
die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of one who
dies,’ says the Lord God. ‘Therefore turn and live!’ ” (18:31-32).

God does not ask us to feel worse than we already do about our
failures or to try harder to keep His commands. Instead, He invites us
to receive a fresh source of motivation and strength—“a new heart and
a new spirit” from Him (36:26-27).

If you’re feeling that you’ve wandered too far away from God and that
He is through with you, it’s time to embrace the truth. Will you
accept the Father’s invitation to “turn and live” today?
