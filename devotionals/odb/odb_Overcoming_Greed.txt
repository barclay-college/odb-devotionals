Overcoming Greed

Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give,
willing to share. —
1 Timothy 6:18

Today's Scripture: 1 Timothy 6:6-19

Greed — it has toppled highly paid executives, brought down giant
corporations, and cost thousands of workers their jobs and retirement
funds. One columnist has written that unrestrained corporate greed is
a greater threat than terrorism.

Greed whispers in our ear that we would be happier if we had more
money, more things, and more power. It creates discontent and a
growing desire to do whatever it takes to gain position and
possessions. But the Bible commands us to trust in God, not
in“uncertain riches”(1 Timothy 6:17).

Paul told Timothy that the way to overcome greed is to flee from it
and to“pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience,
gentleness”(1 Timothy 6:11). And those“who are rich in this present
age,” who have more than is needed, should“be rich in good works,
ready to give, willing to share”(vv.17-18).

Contentment and generosity are the opposite of greed (vv.6-8). As we
learn to thank God for what we have and freely share it with others,
we stop trying to fill the spiritual vacuum in our heart with things.
And when we love Jesus more than money and possessions, we find that
He is the greatest treasure of our lives. We discover that knowing Him
is the source of genuine satisfaction.

Reflect & Pray

God’s riches fill up our supply, Whatever we may need, So we can then
be generous And not controlled by greed. —Sper

The best remedy for greed is generosity.
