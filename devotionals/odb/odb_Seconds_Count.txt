Seconds Count

Show me, Lord, my life’s end.
Psalm 39:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 39:4-13

At the age of 59 my friend Bob Boardman wrote, “If the 70 years of a
normal life span were squeezed into a single 24-hour day, it would now
be 8:30 in the evening in my life. . . . Time is slipping by so
rapidly.”

The difficulty in admitting that our time on earth is limited inspired
the creation of “Tikker”—a wristwatch that tells you what time it is,
calculates your estimated normal life span, and displays a running
countdown of your remaining time. It is advertised as the watch “that
counts down your life, just so you can make every second count.”

In Psalm 39, David grappled with the brevity of his life, saying,
“Show me, Lord, my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know
how fleeting my life is” (v. 4). He described his life span as no
longer than the width of his hand, as only a moment to God, and merely
a breath (v. 5). David concluded, “But now, Lord, what do I look for?
My hope is in you” (v. 7).

The clock is ticking. Now is the time to seek God’s power to help us
become the people He wants us to be. Finding hope in our eternal God
gives meaning for our lives today.

Reflect & Pray

In what ways am I wasting time? In what ways am I making my days
count? In what areas do I need to make changes?

The time to live for Jesus is now.
