Faces

We all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are
being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory.
2 Corinthians 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 5:22–26

When our granddaughter Sarah was very young, she explained to me what
happens when you die: “Only your face goes to heaven, not your body.
You get a new body, but keep the same face.”

Sarah’s concept of our eternal state was a child’s understanding, of
course, but she did grasp an essential truth. In a sense, our faces
are a visible reflection of the invisible soul.

My mother used to say that an angry look might someday freeze on my
face. She was wiser than she knew. A worried brow, an angry set to our
mouths, a sly look in our eyes may reveal a miserable soul. On the
other hand, kind eyes, a gentle look, a warm and welcoming
smile—despite wrinkles, blemishes, and other disfigurements—become the
marks of inner transformation.

We can’t do much about the faces we were born with, but we can do
something about the kind of person we’re growing into. We can pray for
humility, patience, kindness, tolerance, gratefulness, forgiveness,
peace, and love (Galatians 5:22–26).

By God’s grace, and in His time, may you and I grow toward an inner
resemblance to our Lord, a likeness reflected in a kind, old face.
Thus, as English poet John Donne (1572–1631) said, age becomes
“loveliest at the latest day.”

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, I want to be more like You each day. Help me to cooperate
with the work You want to do in my heart.

There’s nothing like the beauty of a loving heart.
