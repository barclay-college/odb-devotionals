Water For The World

He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart
will flow rivers of living water. —
John 7:38

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 4:7-15

Although 70 percent of the world is covered by water, less than
1 percent of it is drinkable by humans. Water conservation and
sanitation are crucial matters in many parts of the world, as all life
depends on having sanitary water.

Jesus went out of His way to introduce a lost woman to another kind of
life-giving water. He deliberately chose to go to a town in Samaria, a
place where no respectable rabbi would set foot. There, He told this
woman about “living water.” Those who drink of it, He said, “will
never thirst.” It will “become in him a fountain of water springing up
into everlasting life” (John 4:14).

The living water is Jesus Himself. Those who receive Him have eternal
life (v.14). But the living water He provides also serves another
function. Jesus said of those who receive it: “Out of his heart will
flow rivers of living water” (7:38). The living water that refreshes
us is to refresh others also.

As fresh-water distribution is uneven in the world, so too is the
distribution of living water. Many people do not know followers of
Jesus who really care about them. It is our privilege to share Him.
Christ is, after all, the living water for whom people are thirsting.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, I want to live for You. May Your life and love flow
through me as I go about my duties today so that others may see You
through me and be drawn to the living water.

Jesus is a never-ending supply of living water for a parched world.
