Seasons Of Ups And Downs

A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to
dance. —
Ecclesiastes 3:4

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

Most of us would agree that life has its ups and downs. Wise King
Solomon believed this and reflected on our responses to fluctuating
circumstances. In Ecclesiastes, he wrote: “To everything there is a
season, a time for every purpose under heaven: . . . a time to weep,
and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance” (3:1-4).

Solomon’s father, David, was called “a man after [God’s] own heart” (1
Sam. 13:14; Acts 13:22). Yet David’s life illustrates how life is
filled with seasons of ups and downs. David wept over his and
Bathsheba’s first child who was fatally ill (2 Sam. 12:22). Yet he
also wrote songs of praise and joyous laughter (Ps. 126:1-3). With the
death of his rebellious son Absalom, David experienced a time of deep
mourning (2 Sam. 18:33). And when the ark was brought to Jerusalem,
David, in spiritual ecstasy, danced before the Lord (2 Sam. 6:12-15).

We do a disservice to ourselves and others when we portray the
Christian life as peaceful and happy all the time. Instead, the Bible
portrays the believer’s life as consisting of seasons of ups and
downs. In what season are you? Whether a time of joy or sadness, each
season should motivate us to seek the Lord and trust Him.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help us to turn to You not only in sadness but also in joy.
We know You give us both good times and bad to draw us to You and help
us grow. May we learn to trust You in all seasons of life. Amen.

Every season needs faith to get us through it.
