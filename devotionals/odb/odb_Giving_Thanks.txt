Giving Thanks

Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have
heard Me.” —
John 11:41

Today's Scripture: John 11:32-44

A tragedy left a family with a void that nothing could fill. A toddler
chasing a cat wandered into the road and was run over by a delivery
truck. A 4-year-old watched in shocked silence as her parents cradled
the lifeless body of her little sister. For years, the cold emptiness
of that moment encased the family in sadness. Feelings were frozen.
The only comfort was numbness. Relief was unimaginable.

Author Ann Voskamp was the 4-year-old, and the sorrow surrounding her
sister’s death formed her view of life and God. The world she grew up
in had little concept of grace. Joy was an idea that had no basis in
reality.

As a young mother, Voskamp set out to discover the elusive thing the
Bible calls joy. The words for joy and grace come from the Greek word
chairo, which she found out is at the center of the Greek word for
thanksgiving. Could it be that simple? she wondered. To test her
discovery, Voskamp decided to give thanks for 1,000 gifts she already
had. She started slowly but soon gratefulness was flowing freely.

Just as Jesus gave thanks before, not after, raising Lazarus from the
dead (John 11:41), Voskamp discovered that giving thanks brought to
life feelings of joy that had died along with her sister. Joy comes
from thanksgiving.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I thank You that You have the power to raise the dead. May the
feelings of joy that arise from our thanksgiving be seeds of grace to
those who are afraid to feel.

The joy of living comes from a heart of thanksgiving.
