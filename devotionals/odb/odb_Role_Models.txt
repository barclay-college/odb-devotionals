Role Models

Do all things without complaining and disputing, that you may become
blameless and harmless, children of God without fault. —
Philippians 2:14-15

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:12-18

During a summer of international sports scandals involving gambling
and substance abuse, two athletes were applauded for their character
as much as their professional accomplishments. A record crowd of
75,000 cheered Cal Ripken Jr. and Tony Gwynn during their 2007
induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. “Whether we like it
or not,” Ripken said, “as big leaguers, we are role models. The only
question is, will it be positive or will it be negative?”

Gwynn echoed the sentiment: “There’s more than just playing the game
of baseball. . . . You’re responsible, you’ve got to make good
decisions and show people how things are supposed to be done.”

Every day, people are watching us. As followers of Christ, we are
guided by Paul’s challenge to “become blameless and harmless, children
of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15).

Compromise causes others to become disillusioned, while character
fosters hope. As the life of our Savior flows out from us, we can
encourage others and point them to Him.

What kind of role model will we be for someone watching today?

Reflect & Pray

Guard well your life, to the Savior be true; Many are watching each
deed that you do; Hence if you stumble and fall in deep sin, It will
prove harder lost souls here to win. —Bosch

The best role models model Christ.
