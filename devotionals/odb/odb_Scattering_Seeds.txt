Scattering Seeds

The seed falling on good soil . . . produces a crop, yielding a
hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.
Matthew 13:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 13:1–9

I received a wonderful email from a woman who wrote, “Your mom was my
first-grade teacher at Putnam City in 1958. She was a great teacher
and very kind, but strict! She made us learn the 23rd Psalm and say it
in front of the class, and I was horrified. But it was the only
contact I had with the Bible until 1997 when I became a Christian. And
the memories of Mrs. McCasland came flooding back as I re-read it.”

Jesus told a large crowd a parable about the farmer who sowed his seed
that fell on different types of ground—a hard path, rocky ground,
clumps of thorns, and good soil (Matt. 13:1–9). While some seeds never
grew, “the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the
word and understands it” and “produces a crop yielding a hundred,
sixty or thirty times what was sown” (v. 23).

During the twenty years my mother taught first grade in public
schools, along with reading, writing, and arithmetic she scattered
seeds of kindness and the message of God’s love.

Her former student’s email concluded, “I have had other influences in
my Christian walk later in life, of course. But my heart always
returns to [Psalm 23] and [your mom’s] gentle nature.”

A seed of God’s love sown today may produce a remarkable harvest.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, today I want my life to sow good seeds in those around me. Help
me to give out what You have put into me.

We sow the seed—God produces the harvest.
