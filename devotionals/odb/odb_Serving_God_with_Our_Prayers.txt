Serving God with Our Prayers

The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces
wonderful results.
James 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Kings 18:41–45

God often chooses to move through our prayers to accomplish His work.
We see this when God told the prophet Elijah, “I will send rain on the
land,” promising to end a drought in Israel that had lasted three and
a half years (James 5:17). Even though God had promised rain, a short
time later “Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the
ground and put his face between his knees”—praying intently for the
rain to come (1 Kings 18:42). Then, while he continued to pray, Elijah
sent his servant to go and look out over the ocean “seven times,”
scanning the horizon for any sign of rain (v. 43).

Elijah understood that God wants us to join in His work through
humble, persistent prayer. Regardless of our human limitations, God
may choose to move through our praying in amazing ways. That’s why the
letter of James tells us that “the earnest prayer of a righteous
person has great power and produces wonderful results,” all the while
reminding us that “Elijah was as human as we are” (James 5:16–17 nlt).

When we make it our aim to serve God through praying faithfully as
Elijah did, we’re taking part in a beautiful privilege—where at any
moment we may be given a front-row seat to a miracle!
