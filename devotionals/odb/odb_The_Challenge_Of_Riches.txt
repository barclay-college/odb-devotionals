The Challenge Of Riches

Command those who are rich in this present age not to . . . trust in
uncertain riches but in the living God. —
1 Timothy 6:17

Today's Scripture: 1 Timothy 6:6-10,17-19

While our family was living in Kenya in the 1980s, we drove a young
woman from Nairobi to visit her parents who lived near Lake Victoria.
On the way, we stopped in the city of Kisumu to leave our luggage at a
hotel where we would stay after taking her home. When our friend saw
our hotel room that we considered an average-size room with two beds,
she said, “All this for only five of you?” What we considered
ordinary, she saw as luxurious. Riches are relative, and some of us
who live in prosperous nations have a tendency to complain about a
standard of living that others would gladly embrace.

Among the followers of Christ in Ephesus, some had more money than
others. To Timothy, their pastor, Paul wrote, “Command those who are
rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain
riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy”
(1 Tim. 6:17). Paul urged them to “be rich in good works, ready to
give, willing to share” (v.18).

Our natural tendency is to grasp what we have instead of freely giving
to those in need. The challenge of riches is living with thankful
hearts to God and open hands to others.

Reflect & Pray

One grace each child of God can show Is giving from a willing heart;
Yet, if we wait till riches grow, It may be that we’ll never start.
—D. DeHaan

We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give.
