Always Pray and Don’t Give Up

Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should
always pray and not give up. Luke 18:1
Luke 18:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 18:1-8

Are you going through one of those times when it seems every attempt
to resolve a problem is met with a new difficulty? You thank the Lord
at night that it’s taken care of but awake to find that something else
has gone wrong and the problem remains.

During an experience like that, I was reading the gospel of Luke and
was astounded by the opening words of chapter 18:  “Then Jesus told
his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and
not give up” (v. 1). I had read the story of the persistent widow many
times but never grasped why Jesus told it (vv. 2-8). Now I connected
those opening words with the story. The lesson to His followers was
very clear: “Always pray and never give up.”

Prayer is not a means of coercing God to do what we want. It is a
process of recognizing His power and plan for our lives. In prayer we
yield our lives and circumstances to the Lord and trust Him to act in
His time and in His way.

As we rely on God’s grace not only for the outcome of our requests but
for the process as well, we can keep coming to the Lord in prayer,
trusting His wisdom and care for us.

Our Lord’s encouragement to us is clear: Always pray and don’t give
up!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, in the difficulty I face today, guard my heart, guide my words,
and show Your grace. May I always turn to You in prayer.

Prayer changes everything.
