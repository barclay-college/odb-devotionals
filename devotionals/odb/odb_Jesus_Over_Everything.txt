Jesus Over Everything

He is before all things.
Colossians 1:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:15-20

My friend’s son decided to wear a sports jersey over his school
clothing one day. He wanted to show support for his favorite team that
would be playing an important game later that night. Before leaving
home, he put something on over his sports jersey—it was a chain with a
pendant that read, “Jesus.” His simple action illustrated a deeper
truth: Jesus deserves first place over everything in our lives.

Jesus is above and over all. “He is before all things, and in him all
things hold together” (Col. 1:17). Jesus is supreme over all creation
(vv. 15-16). He is “the head of the body, the church” (v. 18). Because
of this, He should have first place in all things.

When we give Jesus the highest place of honor in each area of our
lives, this truth becomes visible to those around us. At work, are we
laboring first for God or only to please our employer? (3:23). How do
God’s standards show up in the way we treat others? (vv. 12-14). Do we
put Him first as we live our lives and pursue our favorite pastimes?

When Jesus is our greatest influence in all of life, He will have His
rightful place in our hearts.

Dear Jesus, You deserve the best of my time, energy, and affection. I
