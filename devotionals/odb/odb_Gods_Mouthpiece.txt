God’s Mouthpiece

Who gave human beings their mouths? . . . Is it not I, the Lord? Now
go; I will help you speak.
Exodus 4:11–12

Today's Scripture: Exodus 4:1–12

My nerves fluttering, I waited for the phone to ring and the radio
interview to start. I wondered what questions the host would ask and
how I would respond. “Lord, I’m much better on paper,” I prayed. “But
I suppose it’s the same as Moses—I need to trust that you will give me
the words to speak.”

Of course I’m not comparing myself with Moses, the leader of God’s
people who helped them escape slavery in Egypt to life in the Promised
Land. A reluctant leader, Moses needed the Lord to reassure him that
the Israelites would listen to him. The Lord revealed several signs to
him, such as turning his shepherd’s staff into a snake (Ex. 4:3), but
Moses hesitated to accept the mantle of leadership, saying he was slow
of speech (v. 10). So God reminded him that He is the Lord and that He
would help him speak. He would “be with his mouth” (as the original
language translates, according to biblical scholars).

We know that since the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, God’s
Spirit lives within His children and that however inadequate we may
feel, He will enable us to carry out the assignments He gives to us.
The Lord will “be with our mouths.”
