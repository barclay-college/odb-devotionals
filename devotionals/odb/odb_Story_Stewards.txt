Story Stewards

Take heed . . . lest you forget the things your eyes have seen . . . .
And teach them to your children and your grandchildren. —
Deuteronomy 4:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 4:1-9

Many people take great care to make sure their resources are used well
after they die. They set up trusts, write wills, and establish
foundations to guarantee that their assets will continue to be used
for a good purpose after their life on earth is done. We call this
good stewardship.

Equally important, however, is being good stewards of our life story.
God commanded the Israelites not only to teach their children His laws
but also to make sure they knew their family history. It was the
responsibility of parents and grandparents to make sure their children
knew the stories of how God had worked in their behalf (Deut. 4:1-14).

God has given each of us a unique story. His plan for our lives is
individualized. Do others know what you believe and why? Do they know
the story of how you came to faith and how God has worked in your life
to strengthen your faith? Do they know how God has shown Himself
faithful and has helped you through doubts and disappointments?

The faithfulness of God is a story that we have the privilege to pass
on. Record it in some way and share it. Be a good steward of the story
that God is telling through you.
