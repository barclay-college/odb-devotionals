A Perfect World

He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!”
Revelation 21:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 21:1–5

Katie was given a school assignment to write an essay entitled “My
Perfect World.” She wrote: “In my perfect world . . . ice cream is
free, lollipops are everywhere, and the sky is blue all the time, with
only a few clouds that have interesting shapes.” Then her essay took a
more serious turn. In that world, she continued, “No one will come
home to bad news. And no one will have to be the one to deliver it.”

No one will come home to bad news. Isn’t that wonderful? Those words
point powerfully to the confident hope we have in Jesus. He is “making
everything new”—healing and transforming our world (Revelation 21:5).

Paradise is the place of “no more”—no more evil, no more death, no
more mourning, no more pain, no more tears (v. 4)! It is a place of
perfect communion with God, who by His love has redeemed and claimed
believers as His own (v. 3). What marvelous joy awaits us!

We can enjoy a foretaste of this perfect reality here and now. As we
seek to fellowship with God daily, we experience the joy of His
presence (Colossians 1:12–13). And even as we struggle against sin, we
experience, in part, the victory that is ours in Christ (2:13–15), the
One who fully conquered sin and death.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You that You are making all things new. Help us to live in
the hope of the day we will live with You, pure and blameless, on a
new earth in Your presence forever and ever.

God’s perfect world is for all who believe in Jesus.
