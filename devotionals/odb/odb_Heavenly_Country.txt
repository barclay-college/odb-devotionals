Heavenly Country

Our citizenship is in heaven. —
Philippians 3:20

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 11:8-16

During high school, my closest friend and I took a pair of horses out
for an afternoon ride. We slowly roamed through fields of wildflowers
and wooded groves. But when we nosed the horses in the direction of
the barn, they took off toward home like twin rockets. Our equine
friends knew that it was time for dinner and a good brushing, and they
could hardly wait.

As Christians, our true home is heaven (Phil. 3:20). Yet sometimes our
desires tether us to the here and now. We enjoy God’s good
gifts—marriage, children, grandchildren, travel, careers, friends. At
the same time, the Bible challenges us to focus on “things above”
(Col. 3:1-2). Things above may include the unseen benefits of heaven:
God’s enduring presence (Rev. 22:3-5), unending rest (Heb. 4:9), and
an everlasting inheritance (1 Peter 1:4).

Recently I read, “Believers desire the heavenly inheritance; and the
stronger the faith is, the more fervent [the desire].” Several Old
Testament believers mentioned in Hebrews 11 had strong faith in God
that enabled them to embrace His promises before receiving them
(v.13). One such promise was heaven. If we too put our faith in God,
He will give us a desire for that “heavenly country” (v.16) and will
loosen our grip on this world.

Reflect & Pray

When we all get to heaven, What a day of rejoicing that will be! When
we all see Jesus, We’ll sing and shout the victory. —Hewitt

For the Christian, heaven is spelled H-O-M-E.
