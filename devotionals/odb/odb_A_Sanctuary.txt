A Sanctuary

Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. —
Matthew 11:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 11:25-30

Entering a church in Klang, Malaysia, I was intrigued by the sign
welcoming us into the building. It declared the place to be “A
Sanctuary for the Heavy Laden.”

Few things better reflect the heart of Christ than for His church to
be a place where burdens are lifted and the weary find rest. This was
vital in Jesus’ ministry, for He said, “Come to Me, all you who labor
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28).

Jesus promised to take our burdens and exchange them for His light
load. “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and
lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is
easy and My burden is light” (vv.29-30).

This promise is backed by His great strength. Whatever burdens we may
carry, in Christ we find the strong shoulders of the Son of God, who
promises to take our heavy burdens and exchange them for His light
load.

Christ, who loves us with an everlasting love, understands our
struggles, and can be trusted to provide us with a rest we can never
find on our own. His strength is enough for our weakness, making Him
our “sanctuary for the heavy laden.”

Reflect & Pray

“Let not your heart be troubled,” His tender word I hear, And resting
on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears. —Martin

God calls the restless ones to find their rest in Him.
