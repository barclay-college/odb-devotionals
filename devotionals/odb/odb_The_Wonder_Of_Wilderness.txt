The Wonder Of Wilderness

Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth; break forth in song,
rejoice, and sing praises. —
Psalm 98:4

Today's Scripture: Psalm 98

The psalmists had an advantage in praise because of their closer tie
to the natural world. David began life outdoors as a shepherd, then
spent years hiding in the rocky terrain of Israel. Not surprisingly, a
great love, even reverence, for the natural world shines through many
of his poems. The psalms present a world that fits together as a
whole, with everything upheld by a personal God watching over it.

Wilderness announces to our senses the splendor of an invisible,
untamable God. How can we not offer praise to the One who dreamed up
porcupines and elk, who splashed bright-green aspen trees across
hillsides of gray rock, who transforms the same landscape into a work
of art with every blizzard?

The world, in the psalmist’s imagination, cannot contain the delight
God inspires. “Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth; break forth
in song, rejoice, and sing praises” (Ps. 98:4). Nature itself joins
in: “Let the rivers clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together
before the Lord” (v.8).

The psalms wonderfully solve the problem of a praise-deficient culture
by providing the necessary words. We merely need to enter into those
words, letting God use the psalms to realign our inner attitudes.
