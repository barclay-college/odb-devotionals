Breath of Life

Then the Lord God . . . breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.
Genesis 2:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 2:4–8

On a cold and frosty morning, as my daughter and I walked to school,
we enjoyed seeing our breath turn to vapor. We giggled at the various
steamy clouds we could each produce. I received the moment as a gift,
reveling in being with her and being alive.

Our breath, which is usually invisible, was seen in the cold air, and
it made me think about the Source of our breath and life—the Lord our
Creator. For He who formed Adam out of the dust of the ground, giving
him the breath of life, also gives life to us and to every living
creature (Gen. 2:7). All things come from Him—even our very breath,
which we inhale without even thinking about.

We may be tempted, living with today’s conveniences and technology, to
forget our beginnings and that God is the one who gives us life. But
when we pause to remember that God is our Creator, we can build an
attitude of thankfulness into our daily routines. We can ask Him for
help and acknowledge the gift of life with humble, thankful hearts.
May our gratitude spill out and touch others, so that they also may
give thanks to the Lord for His goodness and faithfulness.
