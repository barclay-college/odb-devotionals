Anger Management

In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are
still angry.
Ephesians 4:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:15, 26–32

As I had dinner with a friend, she expressed how fed up she was with a
particular family member. But she was reluctant to say anything to him
about his annoying habit of ignoring or mocking her. When she did try
to confront him about the problem, he responded with sarcastic
remarks. She exploded in anger at him. Both parties wound up digging
in their heels, and the family rift widened.

I can relate, because I handle anger the same way. I also have a hard
time confronting people. If a friend or family member says something
mean, I usually suppress how I feel until that person or someone else
comes along and says or does something else mean. After a while, I
explode.

Maybe that’s why the apostle Paul in Ephesians 4:26 said, “Do not let
the sun go down while you are still angry.” Providing a time limit on
unresolved issues keeps anger in check. Instead of stewing over a
wrong, which is a breeding ground for bitterness, we can ask God for
help to “[speak] the truth in love” (Eph. 4:15).

Got a problem with someone? Rather than hold it in, hold it up to God
first. He can fight the fire of anger with the power of His
forgiveness and love.
