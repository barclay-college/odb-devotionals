Loaves and Fishes

Jesus replied, “They do not need to go away. You give them something
to eat.”
Matthew 14:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 14:13–21

A young boy came home from church and announced with great
excitement that the lesson had been about a boy who “loafed and fished
all day.” He, of course, was thinking of the little boy who offered
his loaves and fish to Jesus.

Jesus had been teaching the crowds all day, and the disciples
suggested He send them into the village to buy bread. Jesus replied,
“You give them something to eat” (Matthew 14:16). The disciples were
perplexed for there were more than 5,000 to be fed!

You may know the rest of the story: a boy gave his lunch—five small
loaves of bread and two fish—and with it Jesus fed the crowd (vv.
13–21). One school of thought contends that the boy’s generosity
simply moved others in the crowd to share their lunches, but Matthew
clearly intends us to understand that this was a miracle, and the
story appears in all four gospels.

What can we learn? Family, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and others
stand around us in varying degrees of need. Should we send them away
to those who are more capable than we are? Certainly, some people’s
needs exceed our ability to help them, but not always. Whatever you
have—a hug, a kind word, a listening ear, a brief prayer, some wisdom
you’ve gathered—give it to Jesus and see what He can do.

Reflect & Pray

What’s one need of another person that you may be able to meet? What
can you give to Jesus to be used to bless others?

Jesus, give us eyes to see the ways we can care for others. Lead us
and use us.
