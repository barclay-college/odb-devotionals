Repeat After Me

Take control of what I say, O Lord, and guard my lips.
Psalm 141:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 141

When Rebecca stood on stage to speak at a conference, her first
sentence into the microphone echoed around the room. It was a bit
unsettling for her to hear her own words come back at her, and she had
to adjust to the faulty sound system and try to ignore the echo of
every word she spoke.

Imagine what it would be like to hear everything we say repeated! It
wouldn’t be so bad to hear ourselves repeat “I love you” or “I was
wrong” or “Thank You, Lord” or “I’m praying for you.” But not all of
our words are beautiful or gentle or kind. What about those angry
outbursts or demeaning comments that no one wants to hear once, let
alone twice—those words that we would really rather take back?

Like the psalmist David, we long to have the Lord’s control over our
words. He prayed, “Take control of what I say, O Lord, and guard my
lips” (Ps. 141:3 nlt). And thankfully, the Lord wants to do that. He
can help us control what we say. He can guard our lips.

As we learn to adjust to our own sound system by paying careful
attention to what we say and praying about the words we speak, the
Lord will patiently teach us and even empower us to have self-control.
And best of all, He forgives us when we fail and is pleased with our
desire for His help.

Reflect & Pray

Can you think of something you said recently that you would like to
take back? Ask the Lord to help you become aware of careless words.

Part of self-control is mouth-control.
