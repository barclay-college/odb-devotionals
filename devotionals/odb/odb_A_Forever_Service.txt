A Forever Service

Behold, I make all things new. —
Revelation 21:5

Today's Scripture: Revelation 22:1-7

Two young brothers sat on the front row in church every Sunday,
observing their dad as he led the worship service. One night after
sending the boys to bed, the dad overheard one of his boys crying. He
asked him what was wrong, but the boy was hesitant to answer. Finally,
he confessed, “Daddy, the Bible says we’re going to worship God in
heaven forever. That’s an awfully long time!” Because he pictured
heaven as one long worship time with his dad up front leading, heaven
sounded pretty boring to him!

While I sometimes wish we had more information about what heaven will
be like, we know this for sure: boring can’t possibly be the right
word to describe it. We will see beauty like we’ve never seen before,
including “a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal” (Rev.
22:1). We will experience “the glory of God,” which will illuminate
heaven (21:23; 22:5). And we will enjoy a life without pain or sorrow
(21:4).

Yes, we will definitely worship in heaven. People “out of every tribe
and tongue and people and nation” (5:9) will rejoice in praising
Jesus, the worthy Lamb who died for us and rose again (5:12).

We will bask in the glory of the Lord’s presence—forever. But not for
one second will we be bored!

Reflect & Pray

In heaven we’ll see our Savior And like Him we will be; We’ll praise
Him and we’ll serve Him For all eternity! —Fitzhugh

The pleasures of earth cannot be compared to the joys of heaven.
