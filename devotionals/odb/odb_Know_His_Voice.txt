Know His Voice

I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me.
John 10:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 10:1–10

One year for vacation Bible school, Ken’s church decided to bring in
live animals to illustrate the Scripture. When he arrived to help, Ken
was asked to bring a sheep inside. He had to practically drag the
wooly animal by a rope into the church gymnasium. But as the week went
on, it became less reluctant to follow him. By the end of the week,
Ken didn’t have to hold the rope anymore; he just called the sheep and
it followed, knowing it could trust him.

In the New Testament, Jesus compares Himself to a shepherd, stating
that His people, the sheep, will follow Him because they know His
voice (John 10:4). But those same sheep will run from a stranger or
thief (v. 5). Like sheep, we (God’s children) get to know the voice of
our Shepherd through our relationship with Him. And as we do, we see
His character and learn to trust Him.

As we grow to know and love God, we’ll be discerning of His voice and
better able to run from the “the thief [who] comes only to steal and
kill and destroy” (v. 10)—from those who try to deceive and draw us
away from Him. Unlike those false teachers, we can trust the voice of
our Shepherd to lead us to safety.

Reflect & Pray

What’s one thing you’ve learned about God’s character through reading
Scripture? How did that impact you? What will help you to discern
God’s voice?

Heavenly Father, thank You for being my loving Shepherd. Help me to
recognize and follow Your voice only.
