Lured Away

Each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil
desire and enticed.
James 1:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 1:5–6, 12–15

In the summer of 2016, my niece convinced me to play Pokémon Go—a game
played on a smartphone, using the phone’s camera. The object of the
game is to capture little creatures called Pokémon. When one appears
in the game, a red and white ball also appears on the phone’s screen.
To capture a Pokémon, the player has to flick the ball toward it with
the movement of a finger. Pokémon are more easily caught, however, by
using a lure to attract them.

Pokémon characters aren’t the only ones who can be lured away. In his
New Testament letter to believers, James, the brother of Jesus,
reminds us that we “are dragged away by [our] own evil desire” (1:14,
emphasis added). In other words, our desires work with temptation to
lure us down a wrong path. Though we may be tempted to blame God or
even Satan for our problems, our real danger lies within.

But there is good news. We can escape the lure of temptation by
talking to God about the things that tempt us. Though “God cannot be
tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone,” as James explains in 1:13,
He understands our human desire to do what’s wrong. We have only to
ask for the wisdom God promised to provide (1:1–6).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, when I’m tempted, show me the door of escape.

Pray your way past the urge to do wrong.
