Wait On The Lord

I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined to me, and heard my
cry. —
Psalm 40:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 27

With so many instantaneous forms of communication today, our
impatience with hearing a reply from others is sometimes laughable.
Someone I know sent an e-mail to his wife and then called her by cell
phone because he couldn’t wait for a reply!

Sometimes we feel that God has let us down because He does not provide
an immediate answer to a prayer. Often our attitude becomes, “Answer
me speedily, O Lord; my spirit fails!” (Ps. 143:7).

But waiting for the Lord can transform us into a people of growing
faith. King David spent many years waiting to be crowned king and
fleeing from Saul’s wrath. David wrote, “Wait on the Lord; be of good
courage, and He shall strengthen your heart” (Ps. 27:14). And in
another psalm he encourages us with these words, “I waited patiently
for the Lord; and He inclined to me, and heard my cry. He . . . set my
feet upon a rock, and established my steps” (40:1-2). David grew into
“a man after [God’s] own heart” by waiting on the Lord (Acts 13:22;
see 1 Sam. 13:14).

When we become frustrated with God’s apparent delay in answering our
prayer, it is good to remember that He is interested in developing
faith and perseverance in our character (James 1:2-4). Wait on the
Lord!

soul to bless. —Walford

God stretches our patience to enlarge our soul.
