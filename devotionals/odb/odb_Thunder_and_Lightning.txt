Thunder and Lightning

The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning.
Psalm 29:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 29

Many years ago a friend and I were fishing a series of beaver ponds
when it started to rain. We took cover under a nearby grove of quaking
aspen, but the rain continued to fall. So we decided to call it a day
and run for the truck. I had just opened the door when lightning
struck the aspen grove with a thunderous fireball that stripped leaves
and bark off the trees, leaving a few limbs smoldering. And then there
was silence.

We were shaken and awed.

Lightning flashes and thunder rolls across our Idaho valley. I love
it—despite my close call. I love the raw power. Voltage! Percussion!
Shock and awe! The earth and everything in it trembles and shakes. And
then there is peace.

I love lightning and thunder primarily because they are symbols of
God’s voice (Job 37:4), speaking with stupendous, irresistible power
through His Word. “The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of
lightning . . . The Lord gives strength to his people; the Lord
blesses his people with peace” (Ps. 29:7, 11). He gives strength to
endure, to be patient, to be kind, to sit quietly, to get up and go,
to do nothing at all.

May the God of peace be with you.

Reflect & Pray

Calm my spirit in the storms, Lord. Grant me Your peace and the
strength to walk through this day.

Faith connects our weakness to God's strength.
