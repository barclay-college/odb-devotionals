“I’m Really Scared . . .”

Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer
and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
Philippians 4:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:4–9

“I’m really scared.” This was the poignant note a teenager posted to
friends on Facebook as she told them of some upcoming medical tests.
She was facing hospitalization and a series of procedures in a city
three hours from home and anxiously waited as doctors tried to
discover the source of some serious medical problems she was
experiencing.

Who of us, in youth or later years, has not felt similar fears when
facing unwanted life events that are truly frightening? And where can
we turn for help? What comfort can we find from Scripture to give us
courage in these kinds of situations?

The reality that God will go with us through our trial can help us to
hope. Isaiah 41:13 tells us, “For I am the Lord your God who takes
hold of your right hand and says to you, ‘Do not fear; I will help
you.’ ”

In addition, God offers indescribable, heart-guarding peace when we
present our difficulties to Him in prayer (Phil. 4:6–7).

Through God’s unfailing presence and His peace that “transcends all
understanding” (v. 7), we can find the hope and help we need to endure
situations in which we are really scared.

Reflect & Pray

Dear heavenly Father, when I am afraid, remind me that You hold my
hand and give me peace. I’m grateful that I can lean into Your arms
and find help when I’m scared. You are good to me.

God is with us in all our struggles.
