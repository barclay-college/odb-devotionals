Calming Your Soul

Be still, and know that I am God.
Psalm 46:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 11:25–30

While attending a concert, my mind detoured to a troublesome issue
that insisted on my attention. Thankfully, the distraction was short-
lived as the words of a beautiful hymn began to reach deep into my
being. A men’s a capella group was singing “Be Still, My Soul.” Tears
welled up as I listened to the words and contemplated the restful
peace that only God can give:

Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side! Bear patiently the cross
of grief or pain; leave to thy God to order and provide; in every
change He faithful will remain.

When Jesus was denouncing the unrepentant towns where He had done most
of His miracles (Matt. 11:20–24), He still had words of comfort for
those who would come to Him. He said, “Come to me, all you who are
weary and burdened . . . . learn from me, for I am gentle and humble
in heart, and you will find rest for your souls” (vv. 28–29).

This statement is striking! Immediately following His strong words for
those who were rejecting Him, Jesus extended an invitation to all to
draw near to Him to find the peace we all yearn for. Jesus is the only
one who can calm our restless, weary souls.
