Wonderful!

I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me,
which I did not know. —
Job 42:3

Today's Scripture: Job 42:1-6

As our plane began its descent, the flight attendant read the long
list of arrival information as if she were reading it for the
thousandth time that day—no emotion or interest as she droned on about
our impending arrival. Then, with the same tired, disinterested voice,
she finished by saying, “Have a wonderful day.” The dryness of her
tone contrasted with her words. She said “wonderful” but in a manner
completely absent of any sense of wonder.

Sometimes I fear that we approach our relationship with God in the
same way: Routine. Bored. Apathetic. Disinterested. Through Christ, we
have the privilege of being adopted into the family of the living God,
yet often there seems to be little of the sense of wonder that should
accompany that remarkable reality.

Job questioned God about his suffering, but when challenged by Him,
Job was humbled by the wonder of his Creator and His creation. Job
replied, “You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without
knowledge?’ Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things
too wonderful for me, which I did not know” (Job 42:3).

I long for the wonder of God to take hold of my heart. Adopted by
God—what a wonderful reality!

How marvelous! How wonderful! And my song shall ever be: How
marvelous! How wonderful Is my Savior’s love for me! —Gabriel

Nothing can fill our hearts more than the wonder of our God and His
love.
