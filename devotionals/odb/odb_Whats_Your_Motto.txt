What’s Your Motto?

Do not fear . . . ; you are of more value than many sparrows. —
Luke 12:7

Today's Scripture: Luke 12:4-7,22-32

Grug Crood, the dad of a caveman family in an animated movie, believes
that there’s no safe place beyond their cave. They huddle together at
night so he can protect them. He thinks his teenage daughter should
give up her adventurous side because it can only lead to danger. His
motto for his family is “Never not be afraid.” In other words, “Always
be afraid.”

Jesus often told His followers the opposite: “Do not be afraid.” He
said that to Simon when He called him to follow Him (Luke 5:10). When
Jairus, a synagogue leader whose daughter was dying, came to Him,
Jesus reassured him with those same words of care (8:50).

Luke 12 records Jesus telling His disciples not to be afraid when He
taught them how God cared for them much more than for the sparrows
(v.7). And after His resurrection, Jesus told the women who came to
the tomb, “Rejoice! . . . Do not be afraid” (Matt. 28:9-10).

Fear is a universal feeling. We have concerns about loved ones, our
needs, and the unknown future. How can we learn to have faith? The
Lord has given us a foundation on which to build our confidence in
Him: “He Himself has said, ‘I will never leave you nor forsake you.’
So we may boldly say: ‘The Lord is my helper; I will not fear’ ” (Heb.
13:5-6).

Reflect & Pray

Father, life in this world can sometimes be scary. Thank You for the
promise that Your love and care will never be taken away from us. When
fear seems overwhelming, help us to remember Your promises.

The love of God frees us from the prison of fear.
