Ignorance & Innocence

As sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through
righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. —
Romans 5:21

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:12-21

Some people avoid going to the doctor because they don’t want to find
out that anything is wrong with them. Some people avoid going to
church for the same reason. But ignorance of our sickness doesn’t make
us healthy, and ignorance of our sin doesn’t make us innocent

Roman law is considered to be the source of the idea that ignorance of
the law excuses no one. But the concept originated much earlier. When
God gave the law to Israel, He established that even unintentional sin
required a sacrifice for forgiveness (Lev. 4; Ezek. 45:18-20).

In his letter to Christians living in Rome, the apostle Paul addressed
the issue of ignorance or lack of understanding. When people were
ignorant of God’s righteousness, they made up their own (Rom. 10:3).
When we live according to our own standards of right and wrong, we
might feel good about ourselves, but that doesn’t make us spiritually
healthy. Only when we are measured by God’s standard of righteousness
(Jesus) do we know the condition of our spiritual health.

None of us can achieve the righteousness of Christ, but thankfully we
don’t have to. He shares His righteousness with us (5:21). The good
news about finding out what’s wrong with us is that the Great
Physician can make us well.

Reflect & Pray

Great Physician, You know my heart. I bow before You now and ask that
You show me any attitude or action that doesn’t please You. Make me
clean; make me well.

God is the Measurer and Healer of our spiritual health.
