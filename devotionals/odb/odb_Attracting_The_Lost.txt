Attracting The Lost

I have come as a light into the world. —
John 12:46

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 5:12-21

My friend Anna often has people stop her on the street and ask for
directions. This has happened to her even in countries where she is a
foreigner. She wonders if it’s because she has an honest face and
looks trustworthy. I suggested that perhaps it’s because she looks as
if she knows where she’s going. Another friend said that maybe she
attracts the lost.

All of those attributes should be true of God’s people in the
spiritual sense. As believers, we have purpose and direction, we know
where we’re going, and we know how to get there. This gives us
confidence as we go about fulfilling God’s call in our lives. When
this kind of confidence is evident to others, the lost will look to us
for direction.

God has always maintained a presence on earth so that people could
find Him. His first light for the world was the nation of Israel (Isa.
42:6). Then Solomon prayed that God’s great name would draw people to
Himself (1 Kings 8:41-43). The light of the Jewish nation culminated
in Jesus, “the light of the world” (John 9:5). And now, followers of
Jesus are to be the light of the world (Matt. 5:14). As such, it is
our responsibility to show people the way to be reconciled to God (2
Cor. 5:18).

Reflect & Pray

You are called with a holy calling The light of the world to be; To
lift up the lamp of the Savior That others His light may see. —Anon.

To lead others out of the darkness of sin, let them see your light.
