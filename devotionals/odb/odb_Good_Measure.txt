Good Measure

Give, and it will be given to you.
Luke 6:38

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 6:32–38

At a gas station one day, Staci encountered a woman who had left home
without her bank card. Stranded with her baby, she was asking
passersby for help. Although unemployed at the time, Staci spent $15
to put gas in the stranger’s tank. Days later, Staci came home to find
a gift basket of children’s toys and other presents waiting on her
porch. Friends of the stranger had reciprocated Staci’s kindness and
converted her $15 blessing into a memorable Christmas for her family.

This heartwarming story illustrates the point Jesus made when he said,
“Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down,
shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For
with the measure you use, it will be measured to you” (Luke 6:38).

It can be tempting to hear this and focus on what we get out of
giving, but doing so would miss the point. Jesus preceded that
statement with this one: “Love your enemies, do good to them, and lend
to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will
be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is
kind to the ungrateful and wicked” (v. 35).

We don’t give to get things; we give because God delights in our
generosity. Our love for others reflects His loving heart toward us.

In what ways have you experienced God’s generosity in your life? How
can you extend generosity to others?

Gracious Father, help me to give generously to others because You’ve
been so generous to me.
