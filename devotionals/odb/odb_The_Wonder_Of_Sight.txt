The Wonder Of Sight

I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous
are Your works, and that my soul knows very well. —
Psalm 139:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:7-16

On the livescience.com website, I read something pretty amazing: “If
you were standing atop a mountain surveying a larger-than-usual patch
of the planet, you could perceive bright lights hundreds of miles
distant. On a dark night, you could even see a candle flame flickering
up to 30 miles (48 km) away.” No telescopes or night-vision goggles
needed—the human eye is so profoundly designed that even long
distances can be spanned with clear sight.

This fact is a vivid reminder of our amazing Creator, who designed not
only the human eye but also all of the details that make up our
expansive universe. And, unlike anything else in creation, God has
made us in His own image (Gen. 1:26). “In His image” speaks of
something far greater than the ability to see. It speaks of a likeness
to God that makes it possible for us to be in relationship with Him.

We can affirm David’s declaration, “I will praise You, for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works, and that my
soul knows very well” (Ps. 139:14). Not only have we been given eyes
to see, but we have also been made so that, in Christ, one day we will
see Him!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed Wherever I turn my eye, If I
survey the ground I tread Or gaze upon the sky! —Watts

All of God’s creation bears witness to Him as our great Creator.
