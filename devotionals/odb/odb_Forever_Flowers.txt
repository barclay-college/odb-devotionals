Forever Flowers

The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God
endures forever.
Isaiah 40:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 40:1–8

As a toddler, my son Xavier enjoyed giving me flowers. I appreciated
every freshly picked weed or store-bought blossom he purchased with
his dad. I treasured each gift until it wilted and had to be thrown
away.

One day, Xavier gave me a beautiful bouquet of artificial flowers. He
grinned as he arranged the silk white calla lily, yellow sunflower,
and purple hydrangea in a glass vase. “Look, Mommy,” he said. “They’ll
last forever. That’s how much I love you.”

Since then, my boy has grown into a young man. Those silk petals have
frayed. The colors have faded. Still, the Forever Flowers remind me of
his adoration. And there is something else it brings to mind—one thing
that truly stands forever—the limitless and lasting love of God, as
revealed in His infallible and enduring Word (Isa. 40:8).

As the Israelites faced continual trials, Isaiah comforted them with
confidence in God’s enduring words (40:1). He proclaimed that God paid
the debt caused by the Israelites’ sin (v. 2), securing their hope in
the coming Messiah (vv. 3–5). They trusted the prophet because his
focus remained on God rather than their circumstances.

In a world filled with uncertainties and affliction, the opinions of
man and even our own feelings are ever-shifting and as limited as our
mortality (vv. 6–7). Still, we can trust God’s unchanging love and
character as revealed through His constant and eternally true Word.
