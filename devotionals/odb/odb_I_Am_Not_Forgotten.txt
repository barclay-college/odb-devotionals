I Am Not Forgotten

Our soul waits for the Lord; He is our help and our shield. —
Psalm 33:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 13

Waiting is hard at any time; but when days, weeks, or even months pass
and our prayers seem to go unanswered, it’s easy to feel God has
forgotten us. Perhaps we can struggle through the day with its
distractions, but at night it’s doubly difficult to deal with our
anxious thoughts. Worries loom large, and the dark hours seem endless.
Utter weariness makes it look impossible to face the new day.

The psalmist grew weary as he waited (Ps. 13:1). He felt abandoned—as
if his enemies were gaining the upper hand (v.2). When we’re waiting
for God to resolve a difficult situation or to answer often-repeated
prayers, it’s easy to get discouraged.

Satan whispers that God has forgotten us, and that things will never
change. We may be tempted to give in to despair. Why bother to read
the Bible or to pray? Why make the effort to worship with fellow
believers in Christ? But we need our spiritual lifelines most when
we’re waiting. They help to hold us steady in the flow of God’s love
and to become sensitive to His Spirit.

The psalmist had a remedy. He focused on all that he knew of God’s
love, reminding himself of past blessings and deliberately praising
God, who would not forget him. So can we.

Reflect & Pray

Lover of my soul, who draws close in the darkest and longest night,
please keep me trusting You, talking to You, and leaning on Your
promises.

God is worth waiting for; His time is always best.
