Cuddling In

Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.
Psalm 116:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 116:1–7

“Daddy, will you read to me?” my daughter asked. It’s not an unusual
question for a child to make of a parent. But my daughter is eleven
now. These days, such requests are fewer than they were when she was
younger. “Yes,” I said happily, and she curled up next to me on the
couch.

As I read to her (from The Fellowship of the Ring), she practically
melted into me. It was one of those glorious moments as a parent, when
we feel perhaps just an inkling of the perfect love our Father has for
us and His deep desire for us to “cuddle in” to His presence and love.

I realized in that moment that I’m a lot like my eleven-year-old. Much
of the time, I’m focused on being independent. It’s so easy to lose
touch with God’s love for us, a tender and protective love that Psalm
116 describes as “gracious and righteous . . . full of compassion” (v.
5). It’s a love where, like my daughter, I can curl up in God’s lap,
at home in His delight for me.

Psalm 116:7 suggests that we might need to regularly remind ourselves
of God’s good love, and then crawl up into His waiting arms: “Return
to your rest, my soul, for the L ord has been good to you.”
And indeed, He has.

Reflect & Pray

When was the last time you rested quietly in God’s love? What
barriers, if any, might keep you from experiencing the Father’s
delight for you?

Father, thank You for Your perfect love for me. Help me to remember
that love and to rest in Your goodness and delight in me.
