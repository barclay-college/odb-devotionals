Only by Prayer

Everything is possible for one who believes.
Mark 9:23

Today's Scripture: Mark 9:14–29

My friend called me late one night during her cancer treatment.
Grieved by her uncontrollable sobs, I soon added my own tears and a
silent prayer. What am I supposed to do, Lord?

Her wails squeezed my heart. I couldn’t stop her pain, fix her
situation, or find one intelligible word of encouragement. But I knew
who could help. As I wept with my friend, stumbling through a prayer,
I whispered repeatedly, “Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.”

Her cries quieted to sniffs and whimpers, until her breathing slowed.
Her husband’s voice startled me. “She’s asleep,” he said. “We’ll call
tomorrow.”

I hung up, weeping prayers into my pillow.

The gospel of Mark shares a story of another person who wanted to help
his loved one. A desperate father brought his suffering son to Jesus
(Mark 9:17). Doubt clung to his plea, as he reiterated the
impossibility of their circumstances (vv. 20–22) and acknowledged his
need for Jesus to empower his belief (v. 24). The father and son
experienced freedom, hope, and peace when Jesus stepped in and took
control (vv. 25–27).

When loved ones are hurting, it’s natural to want to do the right
things and say the perfect words. But Christ is the only One who can
truly help us. When we call on the name of Jesus, He can enable us to
believe and rely on the power of His presence.
