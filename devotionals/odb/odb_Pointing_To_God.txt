Pointing To God

Remember now your Creator . . . before the difficult days come. —
Ecclesiastes 12:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 8:11-18

“God bless our homeland, Ghana” is the first line of Ghana’s national
anthem. Other African anthems include: “O Uganda, may God uphold
thee,” “Lord, bless our nation” (South Africa), and “O God of
creation, direct our noble cause” (Nigeria). Using the anthems as
prayers, founding fathers called on God to bless their land and its
people. Many national anthems in Africa and others from around the
world point to God as Creator and Provider. Other lines of anthems
call for reconciliation, transformation, and hope for a people often
divided along ethnic, political, and social lines.

Yet today, many national leaders and citizens tend to forget God and
do not live by these statements—especially when life is going well.
But why wait until war, disease, storms, terrorist attacks, or
election violence occurs before we remember to seek God? Moses warned
the ancient Israelites not to forget God and not to stop following His
ways when life was good (Deut. 8:11). Ecclesiastes 12:1 urges us to
“remember now your Creator . . . before the difficult days come.”

Getting close to God while we are strong and healthy prepares us to
lean on Him for support and hope when those “difficult days” in life
come.

Reflect & Pray

Father, I always need You. Forgive me for thinking I am sufficient in
myself. Help me to follow You and Your ways whether life is easy or
difficult. Thank You for caring for me.

Remembering our Creator can be our personal anthem.
