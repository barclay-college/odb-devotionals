Ordinary People

We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the
power may be of God and not of us. —
2 Corinthians 4:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Judges 6:11–16

Gideon was an ordinary person. His story, recorded in Judges 6,
inspires me. He was a farmer, and a timid one at that. When God called
him to deliver Israel from the Midianites, Gideon’s initial response
was “How can I save Israel? Indeed my clan is the weakest in Manasseh,
and I am the least in my father’s house” (Judg. 6:15). God promised
that He would be with Gideon and that he would be able to accomplish
what he had been asked to do (v. 16). Gideon’s obedience brought
victory to Israel, and he is listed as one of the great heroes of
faith (Heb. 11:32).

Many other individuals played a significant part in this plan to save
the Israelites from a strong enemy force. God provided Gideon with 300
men, valiant heroes all, to win the battle. We are not told their
names, but their bravery and obedience are recorded in the Scriptures
(Judg. 7:5-23).

Today, God is still calling ordinary people to do His work and
assuring us that He will be with us as we do. Because we are ordinary
people being used by God, it’s obvious that the power comes from God
and not from us.
