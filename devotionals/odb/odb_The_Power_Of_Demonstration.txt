The Power Of Demonstration

The kingdom of God is not in word but in power. —
1 Corinthians 4:20

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 2:1-5

For 2 decades, ecologist Mike Hands has worked to help farmers in
Central America adopt more effective methods of growing their crops.
It’s difficult, however, for them to abandon their long tradition of
“slash and burn” agriculture, even though they know it destroys the
soil and pollutes the air.

So instead of merely talking to them, Mike shows them a better way. In
the documentary film Up in Smoke, he says: “It has to be demonstrated.
You cannot preach it. You can’t describe it. People have got to be
able to get their hands on it and see it.”

Paul took a similar approach to sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. He
wrote to the believers in Corinth, “My speech and my preaching were
not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the
Spirit and of power, that your faith should not be in the wisdom of
men but in the power of God” (1 Cor. 2:4-5). Later in his letter, Paul
told them again, “The kingdom of God is not in word but in power”
(4:20).

As you live each day, ask God to help you accompany your words with
actions. When we allow God to show Himself through us, it’s a powerful
demonstration of His grace and love.

Reflect & Pray

Allow us, Lord, to demonstrate Our faith by what we do, So that the
gospel can be seen By those who seek for You. —Sper

Our words need actions behind them.
