The Savior Who Knows Us

“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked.
John 1:48

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 1:43–51

“Dad, what time is it?” my son asked from the back seat. “It’s 5:30.”
I knew exactly what he’d say next. “No, it’s 5:28!” I watched his face
light up. Gotcha! his beaming smile said. I felt delight too—the kind
that comes from knowing your child the way only a parent can.

Like any attentive parent, I know my children. I know how they’ll
respond when I wake them up. I know what they’ll want in their
lunches. I know countless interests, desires, and preferences.

But for all that, I’ll never know them perfectly, inside and out, the
way our Lord knows us.

We catch a glimpse of the kind of intimate knowledge Jesus has of His
people in John 1. As Nathanael, who Philip had urged to meet Jesus,
moved toward Him, Jesus pronounced, “Here truly is an Israelite in
whom there is no deceit” (v. 47). Startled, Nathanael responded, “How
do you know me?” Somewhat mysteriously, Jesus replied that He’d seen
him under the fig tree (v. 48).

We may not know why Jesus chose to share this particular detail, but
it seems Nathanael did! Overwhelmed, he responded, “Rabbi, you are the
Son of God” (v. 49).

Jesus knows each of us like this: intimately, completely, and
perfectly—the way we long to be known. And He accepts us
completely—inviting us to be, not only His followers, but His beloved
friends (John 15:15).

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, Thank You for knowing me fully, inside and out, and for loving,
forgiving, and accepting me just the way I am. Thank You for inviting
me into the adventure of following You.

Jesus knows us the way we long to be known.
