Sledding And Praying

Now it came to pass in those days that [Jesus] went out to the
mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. —
Luke 6:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 14:32-42

When the snow flies in Michigan, I like to get my grandkids, grab our
plastic sleds, and go slipping and sliding down our backyard. We zoom
down the hill for about 10 seconds, and then climb back up for more.

When I travel to Alaska with a bunch of teenagers, we also go
sledding. We are hauled by bus nearly to the top of a mountain. We
jump on our sleds and, for the next 10 to 20 minutes (depending on
levels of bravery), we slide at breakneck speeds down the mountain,
holding on for dear life.

Ten seconds in my backyard or 10 minutes down an Alaskan mountain.
They’re both called sledding, but there is clearly a difference.

I’ve been thinking about this in regard to prayer. Sometimes we do the
“10 seconds in the backyard” kind of praying—a quick, spur-of-the-
moment prayer or a short thanks before eating. At other times, we’re
drawn to “down the mountain” praying—extended, intense times that
require concentration and passion in our relationship with Him. Both
have their place and are vital to our lives.

Jesus prayed often, and sometimes for a long time (Luke 6:12; Mark
14:32-42). Either way, let us bring the desires of our heart to the
God of the backyards and the mountains of our lives.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please challenge us to pray constantly—both in short sessions
and long. As we face the valleys, hills, and mountains of our lives,
may we lift our hearts and minds to You in constant communication.

The heart of prayer is prayer from the heart.
