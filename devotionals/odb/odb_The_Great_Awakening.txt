The Great Awakening

God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
1 Thessalonians 4:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 34:1–8

I have a treasured memory of gatherings with family friends when our
boys were small. The adults would talk into the night; our children,
weary with play would curl up on a couch or chair and fall asleep.

When it was time to leave, I would gather our boys into my arms, carry
them to the car, lay them in the back seat, and take them home. When
we arrived, I would pick them up again, tuck them into their beds,
kiss them goodnight, and turn out the light. In the morning they would
awaken—at home.

This has become a rich metaphor for me of the night on which we “sleep
in Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 4:14 kjv ). We slumber . . . and awaken in
our eternal home, the home that will heal the weariness that has
marked our days.

I came across an Old Testament text the other day that surprised me—a
closing comment in Deuteronomy: “Moses . . . died there in Moab, as
the Lord had said” (34:5). The Hebrew means literally, “Moses died . .
. with the mouth of the Lord ,” a phrase ancient rabbis translated,
“With the kiss of the Lord .”

Is it too much to envision God bending over us on our final night on
earth, tucking us in and kissing us goodnight? Then, as John Donne so
eloquently put it, “One short sleep past, we wake eternally.”

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, because Your arms carry us, we can sleep in peace.

For death is no more than a turning of us over from time to eternity.
