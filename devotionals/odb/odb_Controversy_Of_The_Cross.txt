Controversy Of The Cross

The message of the cross is . . . the power of God. —
1 Corinthians 1:18

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 1:17-25

A case before the US Supreme Court focused on whether a religious
symbol, specifically a cross, should be allowed on public land. Mark
Sherman, writing for the Associated Press, said that although the
cross in question was erected in 1934 as a memorial to soldiers who
died in World War I, one veteran’s group that opposed it called the
cross “a powerful Christian symbol” and “not a symbol of any other
religion.”

The cross has always been controversial. In the first century, the
apostle Paul said that Christ had sent him “to preach the gospel, not
with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no
effect. For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are
perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1
Cor. 1:17-18). As followers of Christ, we see the cross as more than a
powerful Christian symbol. It is the evidence of God’s power to free
us from the tyranny of our sin.

In a diverse and pluralistic society, the controversy over religious
symbols will continue. Whether a cross can be displayed on public
property will likely be determined by the courts. But displaying the
power of the cross through our lives will be decided in our hearts.

Reflect & Pray

Christ takes each sin, each pain, each loss, And by the power of His
cross Transforms our brokenness and shame So that our lives exalt His
name. —D. De Haan

Nothing speaks more clearly of God’s love than the cross.
