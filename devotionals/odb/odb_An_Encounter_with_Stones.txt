An Encounter with Stones

He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our
iniquities.
Isaiah 53:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 53:1–6

After centuries of war and destruction, the modern city of Jerusalem
is literally built on its own rubble. During a family visit, we walked
the Via Dolorosa (the Way of Sorrow), the route tradition says Jesus
followed on His way to the cross. The day was hot, so we paused for a
rest and descended to the cool basement of the Convent of the Sisters
of Zion. There I was intrigued by the sight of ancient pavement stones
unearthed during recent construction—stones etched with games played
by Roman soldiers during their idle moments.

Those particular stones, even though likely from a period later than
Jesus, caused me to ponder my spiritual life at the time. Like a bored
soldier passing time in idle moments, I had become complacent and
uncaring toward God and others. I was deeply moved by remembering that
near the place I was standing, the Lord was beaten, mocked, insulted,
and abused as He took all of my failure and rebellion on Himself.

“He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our
iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by
his wounds we are healed” (Isa. 53:5).

My encounter with the stones still speaks to me of Jesus’s loving
grace that is greater than all my sin.
