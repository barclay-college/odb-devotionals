Blunders To Wonders

Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will be restored. —
Lamentations 5:21

Today's Scripture: John 21:15-19

Artist James Hubbell says, “Mistakes are gifts.” Whenever he’s working
on a project and something goes wrong, he doesn’t start over. He looks
for a way to use the mistake to make something better. None of us can
avoid making blunders, and all of us have favorite ways of dealing
with them. We may try to hide them or to correct them or to apologize
for them.

We do that with our sin sometimes too. But God doesn’t throw us away
and start over. He redeems us and makes us better.

The apostle Peter tended to do and say whatever seemed best at the
moment. He has been referred to as an “impetuous blunderer.” In his
fear after Jesus was arrested, Peter claimed three times that he
didn’t know Jesus! Yet later, on the basis of Peter’s three
declarations of love, Jesus turned Peter’s humiliating denial into a
wonderful occasion of restoration (John 21). Despite Peter’s flawed
past, Jesus restored him to ministry with these words: “Feed My sheep”
(v.17).

If you have made a “blunder” so big that it seems irreversible, the
most important matter is whether you love Jesus. When we love Him,
Jesus can turn our most serious blunders into awesome wonders.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I’m so human and make foolish mistakes. And worse yet, I
willfully sin against You. Please forgive me, change me, restore me,
and use me for Your name’s sake. Amen.

God can change our blunders into wonders.
