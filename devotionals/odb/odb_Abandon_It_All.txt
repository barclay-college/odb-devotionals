Abandon It All

I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer
your bodies as a living sacrifice.
Romans 12:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 12:1–8

When I played college basketball, I made a conscious decision at the
beginning of each season to walk into that gym and dedicate myself
totally to my coach—doing whatever he might ask me to do.

It would not have benefited my team for me to announce, “Hey, Coach!
Here I am. I want to shoot baskets and dribble the ball, but don’t ask
me to run laps, play defense, and get all sweaty!”

Every successful athlete has to trust the coach enough to do whatever
the coach asks them to do for the good of the team.

In Christ, we are to become God’s “living sacrifice” (Rom. 12:1). We
say to our Savior and Lord: “I trust You. Whatever You want me to do,
I am willing.” Then He “transforms” us by renewing our minds to focus
on the things that please Him.

It’s helpful to know that God will never call on us to do something
for which He has not already equipped us. As Paul reminds us, “We have
different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us” (v. 6).

Knowing that we can trust God with our lives, we can abandon ourselves
to Him, strengthened by the knowledge that He created us and is
helping us to make this effort in Him.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, no one deserves our sacrifice and dedication more
than You. Help us to realize the joy that comes from abandoning
ourselves to You.

There is no risk in abandoning ourselves to God.
