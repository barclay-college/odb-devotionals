Holding Me Up

I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to
you, Do not fear; I will help you.
Isaiah 41:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:1-7

After I no longer went on family road trips with my parents, it became
a rare occasion to visit my grandparents who lived hundreds of miles
away from us. So one year, I decided to fly to visit them in the small
town of Land O’Lakes, Wisconsin, for a long weekend. As we drove to
the airport for my return flight, Grandma, who had never flown, began
to express her fears to me: “That was such a small plane you flew on .
. . . There’s nothing really holding you up there, is there? . . . I
would be so afraid to go up that high.”

By the time I boarded the small aircraft, I was as fearful as the
first time I had flown. What exactly is holding up this plane, anyway?

Irrational fears, or even legitimate ones, don’t need to terrify us.
David lived as a fugitive, afraid of King Saul who relentlessly
pursued him because he was jealous of David’s popularity with the
people. David found true solace and comfort only in his relationship
with God. In Psalm 34 he wrote: “I sought the Lord, and he answered
me; he delivered me from all my fears” (v. 4).

Our Father in heaven is all-wise and all-loving. When fear starts to
overwhelm us, we need to stop and remember that He is our God and He
will always hold us up.

Reflect & Pray

My fears sometimes overwhelm me, Father. Yet I know that You are here
with me. May Your perfect love cast out my fear and still my troubled
heart!

When we believe that God is good, we can learn to release our fears.
