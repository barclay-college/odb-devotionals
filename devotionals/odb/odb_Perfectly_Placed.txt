Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
Job 38:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 38:4–11

Scientists know our planet is precisely the right distance from the
sun to benefit from its heat. A little closer and all the water would
evaporate, as on Venus. Only a bit farther and everything would freeze
like it does on Mars. Earth is also just the right size to generate
the right amount of gravity. Less would make everything weightlessly
sterile like our moon, while more gravity would trap poisonous gases
that suffocate life as on Jupiter.

The intricate physical, chemical, and biological interactions that
comprise our world bear the imprint of a sophisticated Designer. We
catch a glimpse of this complex craftsmanship when God speaks to Job
about things beyond our understanding. “Where were you when I laid the
earth’s foundation?” God asks. “Who marked off its dimensions? Surely
you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? On what were its
footings set, or who laid its cornerstone?” (Job 38:4–6).

This glimpse of creation’s magnitude causes us to wonder at Earth’s
mighty oceans bowing before the One who “shut up the sea behind doors
when it burst forth from the womb, . . . [who said] ‘This far you may
come and no farther’ ” (vv. 8–11). In wonder may we sing with the
morning stars and shout for joy with the angels (v. 7), for this
elaborate world was made for us that we might know and trust God.
