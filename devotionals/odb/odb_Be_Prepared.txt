Be Prepared

Having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath
through Him. —
Romans 5:9

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:1-11

Just as her friends were doing, my daughter Melissa was busily
preparing for adulthood. At school, she was getting ready for college
by taking the right courses and had signed up for the ACT college
entrance test.

Outside of class, Melissa was learning the socialization skills it
takes to get along with people by spending time with friends,
classmates, and teammates. At her job, she was learning the relational
skills needed for a future career of work. At home, Mell was preparing
for future family life by experiencing the way a Christian family
would interact.

Getting ready for life as an adult takes work, and Melissa was making
good progress.

But none of that preparation was what she would need. In 2002, when
she died in a car accident at age 17, the only preparation that
mattered was her readiness for heaven.

When the truest test of preparedness came so suddenly on that
beautiful June evening—when eternity’s door opened for Melissa—she was
prepared. She had put her faith in Jesus and trusted His sacrifice on
the cross for her sins (John 3:16; Rom. 5:8-9).

When she faced the ultimate test of being prepared, Melissa was ready.
Are you?

Reflect & Pray

God’s time is now, for the days fly fast, And swiftly the seasons
roll; Today is yours, it may be your last; Choose life for your
priceless soul! —Fithian

If death comes today, will you be prepared to meet God?
