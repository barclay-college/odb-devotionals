Watchful and Alert

Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith.
1 Corinthians 16:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 3:1–7

My desk sits close to a window that opens into our neighborhood. From
that vantage point I’m privileged to watch birds perch on the trees
nearby. Some come to the window to eat insects trapped in the screen.

The birds check their immediate surroundings for any danger, listening
attentively as they look about them. Only when they are satisfied that
there is no danger do they settle down to feed. Even then, they pause
every few seconds to scan the area.

The vigilance these birds demonstrate reminds me that the Bible
teaches us to practice vigilance as Christians. Our world is full of
temptations, and we need to remain constantly alert and not forget
about the dangers. Like Adam and Eve, we easily get entangled in
attractions that make the things of this world seem “good for food and
pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom” (Gen.
3:6).

“Be on your guard,” Paul admonished, “stand firm in the faith” (1 Cor.
16:13). And Peter cautioned, “Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy
the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to
devour” (1 Peter 5:8).

As we work for our own daily bread, are we alert to what could start
consuming us? Are we watching for any hint of self-confidence or
willfulness that could leave us wishing we had trusted our God?

Reflect & Pray

Lord, keep us from the secret sins and selfish reactions we’re so
naturally inclined toward. By Your grace, turn our temptations into
moments of growth in Christlikeness.

The best way to escape temptation is to run to God.
