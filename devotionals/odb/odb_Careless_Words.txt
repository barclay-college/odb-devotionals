Careless Words

The tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.
James 3:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 3:1-12

My daughter has had a lot of ill health recently, and her husband has
been wonderfully caring and supportive. “You have a real treasure
there!” I said.

“You didn’t think that when I first knew him,” she said with a grin.

She was quite right. When Icilda and Philip got engaged, I was
concerned. They were such different personalities. We have a large and
noisy family, and Philip is more reserved. And I had shared my
misgivings with my daughter quite bluntly.

I was horrified to realize that the critical things I said so casually
15 years ago had stayed in her memory and could possibly have
destroyed a relationship that has proved to be so right and happy. It
reminded me how much we need to guard what we say to others. So many
of us are quick to point out what we consider to be weaknesses in
family, friends, or work colleagues, or to focus on their mistakes
rather than their successes. “The tongue is a small part of the body,”
says James (3:5), yet the words it shapes can either destroy
relationships or bring peace and harmony to a situation in the
workplace, the church, or the family.

Perhaps we should make David’s prayer our own as we start each day:
“Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips”
(Ps. 141:3).

Reflect & Pray

Father, please curb my careless speech and put a guard on my tongue
today and every day.

A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
Proverbs 25:11 nkjv
