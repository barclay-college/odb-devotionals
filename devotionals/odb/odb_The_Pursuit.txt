The Pursuit

. . . seek [wisdom] as silver, and search for her as for hidden
treasures. —
Proverbs 2:4

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 2:1-9

When my husband, Carl, pursued a relationship with me while we were
dating, he was serious about it. He called. He wrote notes. He asked
thoughtful questions. He bought me flowers, candy, books, dinner, and
other gifts. He spent a lot of time and effort in his pursuit of me.

Way back in the 10th century bc, Solomon recommended that kind of
serious commitment when pursuing something else—wisdom. A dictionary
definition of wisdom, “understanding what is true, right, or lasting,”
sounds crucial if we want a life that glorifies our holy God.

Maybe that’s why Solomon used so many active verbs in Proverbs 2 to
describe our needed efforts to gain wisdom. He said, “incline your
ear,” “apply your heart,” “cry out,” “lift up your voice,” “seek her,”
“search for her” (vv.2-4).

Seeking wisdom takes effort, and Scripture tells us where it can be
found: “For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and
understanding.” He isn’t storing up wisdom for Himself; “He stores up
sound wisdom for the upright” (vv.6-7).

Seek God with all your heart. He is the source of all wisdom for your
life.

Reflect & Pray

What will it profit when life here is o’er, Though great worldly
wisdom I gain, If seeking knowledge I utterly fail The wisdom of God
to obtain? —Nelson

You can acquire much knowledge, but true wisdom comes only from God.
