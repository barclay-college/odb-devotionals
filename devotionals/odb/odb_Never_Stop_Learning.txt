Never Stop Learning

You must continue in the things which you have learned . . . and that
from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures. —
2 Timothy 3:14-15

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Timothy 3:10-17

Sheryl is a voracious reader. While others are watching television or
playing video games, she is deeply engrossed in the pages of a book.

Much of this zeal can be traced back to her early childhood. Her
family often visited a great aunt and uncle who owned a bookstore.
There, Sheryl would sit on Uncle Ed’s lap as he read to her and
introduced her to the wonders and delights of books.

Centuries ago a young man named Timothy had his steps guided on the
road to learning. In Paul’s last recorded letter, he acknowledged that
Timothy was first introduced to the Bible by his grandmother and
mother (2 Tim. 1:5). Then Paul exhorted Timothy to continue in the
Christian way because “from childhood you have known the Holy
Scriptures” (2 Tim. 3:14-15).

For the believer, learning about the spiritual life should never cease
to delight us and help us grow. Reading and study can be a big part of
that, but we also need others to encourage and teach us.

Who has helped you grow in your faith? And who in turn can you help?
That’s a great way to enhance our appreciation of God and strengthen
our relationship with Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give us the desire to learn throughout life, so that we may grow
increasingly closer to You each day. Thank You for those who have
inspired us to learn about You.

Reading the Bible is meant not to inform but to transform.
