Heard By God

Hannah spoke in her heart; . . . her voice was not heard. —
1 Samuel 1:13

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 1:9-20

After reading several children’s books with my daughter, I told her
that I was going to read a grown-up book for a while and then we would
look at books together again. I opened the cover and began to read in
silence. A few minutes later, she looked at me doubtfully and said,
“Mommy, you aren’t really reading.” She assumed that since I wasn’t
speaking, I wasn’t processing the words.

Like reading, prayer can be silent. Hannah, who longed for a child of
her own, visited the temple and “spoke in her heart” as she prayed.
Her lips were moving, but “her voice was not heard” (1 Sam. 1:13). Eli
the priest saw but misunderstood what was happening. She explained, “I
. . . have poured out my soul before the Lord” (v.15). God heard
Hannah’s silent prayer request and gave her a son (v.20).

Since God searches our hearts and minds (Jer. 17:10), He sees and
hears every prayer—even the ones that never escape our lips. His all-
knowing nature makes it possible for us to pray with full confidence
that He will hear and answer (Matt. 6:8,32). Because of this, we can
continually praise God, ask Him for help, and thank Him for
blessings—even when no one else can hear us.

Reflect & Pray

Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of prayer! That calls me from a world
of care, And bids me at my Father’s throne Make all my wants and
wishes known. — Walford

God fills our heart with peace when we pour out our heart to Him.
