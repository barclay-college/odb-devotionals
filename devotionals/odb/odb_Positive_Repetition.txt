Positive Repetition

I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in obedience to
him.
Deuteronomy 30:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 30:11-20

A journalist had a quirky habit of not using blue pens. So when his
colleague asked him if he needed anything from the store, he asked for
some pens. “But not blue pens,” he said. “I don’t want blue pens. I
don’t like blue. Blue is too heavy. So please purchase 12 ballpoint
pens for me—anything but blue!” The next day his colleague passed him
the pens—and they were all blue. When asked to explain, he said, “You
kept saying ‘blue, blue.’ That’s the word that left the deepest
impression!” The journalist’s use of repetition had an effect, but not
the one he desired.

Moses, the lawgiver of Israel, also used repetition in his requests to
his people. More than 30 times he urged his people to remain true to
the law of their God. Yet the result was the opposite of what he asked
for. He told them that obedience would lead them to life and
prosperity, but disobedience would lead to destruction (Deut.
30:15-18).

When we love God, we want to walk in His ways not because we fear the
consequences but because it is our joy to please the One we love.
That’s a good word to remember.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, as we read Your inspired story, may Your Spirit be our
teacher. Help us to walk the path of obedience as we hear the voice of
Your heart.

Love for God will cause you to live for God.
