With God’s Help

So here I am today, eighty-five years old! . . . I’m just as vigorous
to go out to battle now as I was then.
Joshua 14:10–11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Joshua 14:7–15

As I’ve grown older, I’ve noticed more joint pain, especially when
cold weather hits. Some days, I feel less like a conqueror and more
like someone conquered by the challenges of becoming a senior citizen.

That’s why my hero is an older man named Caleb—the former spy sent by
Moses to scout out Canaan, the Promised Land (Num. 13–14). After the
other spies gave an unfavorable report, Caleb and Joshua were the only
spies out of the twelve whom God favored to enter Canaan. Now, in
Joshua 14, the time for Caleb to receive his portion of land had come.
But there were enemies still to drive out. Not content to retire and
leave the battle to the younger generation, Caleb declared, “You
yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were
large and fortified, but, the Lord helping me, I will drive them out
just as he said” (Josh. 14:12).

“The Lord helping me.” That’s the kind of mindset that kept Caleb
battle-ready. He focused on God’s power, not his own, nor on his
advanced age. God would help him do whatever needed to be done.

Most of us don’t think of taking on anything monumental when we reach
a certain age. But we can still do great things for God, no matter how
old we are. When Caleb-sized opportunities come our way, we don’t have
to shy away from them. With the Lord helping us, we can conquer!
