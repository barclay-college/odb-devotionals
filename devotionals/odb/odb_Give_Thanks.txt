Give Thanks

In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
for you. —
1 Thessalonians 5:18

Today's Scripture: 1 Thessalonians 5:16-22

In Lansing, Michigan, during the winter, we don’t get many sunny days.
But last year God blessed us with one of those beautiful days, and it
seemed that almost everyone was thanking God, except me. As I left my
office, a man said, “What a wonderful day we’re having. This is a gift
from God!” To which I replied, “Yes, but we’re getting snow later this
week.” What ingratitude!

In his letters, the apostle Paul helped his readers to develop a
theology of gratitude. He wrote about thanksgiving more often than any
other New Testament author. From the 23 times he used the word, we
learn a few lessons about thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving was always directed toward God and never toward people.
People were gifts from God, and Paul thanked God for their growth,
love, and faith (1 Cor. 1:4; 1 Thess. 1:2).

Thanksgiving is given through Jesus for everything (Col. 3:15,17).
Paul believed followers of Jesus could be thankful for everything
because God is sovereign, and He is working things out for the
believers’ good (1 Thess. 5:18).

May we intentionally be aware of God’s gifts all around us, and
respond with gratitude. In response to God’s gifts, it’s natural to
say, “Thank You, Lord.”

Reflect & Pray

Lord, for days that are sunny or gray we simply want to say, Thank
You! And for the daily grace You give us in Your Son, may we always be
faithful to say, Thank You! You are so good to us.

Gratitude is a natural response to God’s grace.
