Lessons for Little Ones

Start children off on the way they should go.
Proverbs 22:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 22:1-16

When my daughter described a problem she was having in the school
lunchroom, I immediately wondered how I could fix the issue for her.
But then another thought occurred. Maybe God had allowed the problem
so she could see Him at work and get to know Him better. Instead of
running to the rescue, I decided to pray with her. The trouble cleared
up without any help from me!

This situation showed my little one that God cares for her, that He
listens when she prays, and that He answers prayers. The Bible says
there’s something significant about learning these lessons early in
life. If we “start children off on the way they should go, . . .when
they are old they will not turn from it” (Prov. 22:6). When we start
kids off with an awareness of Jesus and His power, we are giving them
a place to return to if they wander and a foundation for spiritual
growth throughout their lives.

Consider how you might foster faith in a child. Point out God’s design
in nature, tell a story about how He has helped you, or invite a
little one to thank God with you when things go right. God can work
through you to tell of His goodness throughout all generations.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, I pray that You will raise up believers in the next
generation. Show me how I can encourage young people to trust in You.

We influence future generations by living for Christ today.
