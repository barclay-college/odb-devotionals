Magic Or Miracle?

Though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and
believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him. —
John 10:38

Today's Scripture: John 10:22-39

Magician Harry Houdini often performed an amazing escape. He was
handcuffed, put inside a sack, and locked in a trunk—but he always
managed to free himself. Some claimed that he had supernatural powers,
but Houdini himself said that all his tricks could be explained.

When a museum in Wisconsin opened an exhibit that showed the secret of
Houdini’s famous escape act, many magicians said it violated their
code of ethics that prohibits revealing how tricks are performed. The
exhibit proved Houdini was a magician, not a miracle worker.

Jesus, however, was a miracle worker. He attributed His supernatural
acts to the power of God. He performed them to heal people and to
prove that He was who He claimed to be—the Son of God. He said, “The
works [miracles] that I do in My Father’s name, they bear witness of
Me. . . . Though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you
may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him” (John
10:25,38).

The wonderful works of Jesus established His identity in history. The
marvelous works He performs through all who trust Him reveal His
identity in the world today. Have you found that to be true in your
life?

Reflect & Pray

Sometimes we see a miracle, And faith in God revives; Yet we should
see God's gracious hand At work throughout our lives. —Hess

In a world of smoke and mirrors, Jesus offers the miracle of
salvation.
