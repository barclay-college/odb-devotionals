Playing with Fire

Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. . . .
And I too will love them and show myself to them.
John 14:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 15:10-20

When I was a young boy, my mom warned me that I should never play with
fire. Yet one day I decided to see what would happen if I did. Taking
a book of matches and some paper, I went out into the backyard to
experiment. With heart beating fast, I knelt on the ground, struck the
match, and set the paper aflame.

Suddenly I saw my mother approaching. Not wanting to get caught, I put
my legs over the flames to hide what I was doing. But Mom shouted,
“Denny, move your legs! There’s a fire underneath them!” Fortunately,
I moved my legs quickly enough and was not burned. I realized then
that my mother’s rule about not playing with fire was not to spoil my
fun but because of her concern to keep me safe.

Sometimes we don’t understand the reasons behind God’s commands. We
may even think He is a cosmic killjoy, setting up rules and
regulations to keep us from enjoying ourselves. But God asks us to
obey Him because He has our best interests at heart. As we obey, we
“remain in his love” and are filled with joy (John 15:10-11).

So when God warns us not to sin, He does it for our own good. He
really wants to protect us from “playing with fire” and getting
burned.
