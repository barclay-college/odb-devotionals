God in the Details

The Lord is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.
Psalm 145:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 10:29–31

When my “chocolate” Labrador retriever puppy was three months old, I
took him to the veterinarian’s office for his shots and checkup. As
our vet carefully looked him over, she noticed a small white marking
in his fur on his left hind paw. She smiled and said to him, “That’s
where God held you when He dipped you in chocolate.”

I couldn’t help but laugh. But she had unintentionally made a
meaningful point about the deep and personal interest God takes in His
creation.

Jesus tells us in Matthew 10:30 that “even the very hairs of your head
are all numbered.” God is so great that He is able to take infinite
interest in the most intimate details of our lives. There is nothing
so small that it escapes His notice, and there is no concern too
trivial to bring before Him. He simply cares that much.

God not only created us; He sustains and keeps us through every
moment. It’s sometimes said that “the devil is in the details.” But
it’s better by far to understand that God is in them, watching over
even the things that escape our notice. How comforting it is to know
that our perfectly wise and caring heavenly Father holds us—along with
all of creation—in His strong and loving hands.
