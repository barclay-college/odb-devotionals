Let Us Praise!

May the nations be glad and sing for joy.
Psalm 67:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 67

When the alarm on Shelley’s phone goes off every day at 3:16 in the
afternoon, she takes a praise break. She thanks God and acknowledges
His goodness. Although she communicates with God throughout the day,
Shelley loves to take this break because it helps her celebrate her
intimate relationship with Him.

Inspired by her joyful devotion, I decided to set a specific time each
day to thank Christ for His sacrifice on the cross and to pray for
those who have yet to be saved. I wonder what it would be like if all
believers in Jesus stopped to praise Him in their own way and pray for
others every day.

The image of a beautiful wave of worship rolling to the ends of the
earth resounds in the words of Psalm 67. The psalmist pleads for God’s
grace, proclaiming his desire to make His name great in all the
nations (vv. 1–2). He sings, “May the peoples praise you, God; may all
the peoples praise you” (v. 3). He celebrates His sovereign rule and
faithful guidance (v. 4). As a living testimony of God’s great love
and abundant blessings, the psalmist leads God’s people into jubilant
praise (vv. 5–6).

God’s continued faithfulness toward His beloved children inspires us
to acknowledge Him. As we do, others can join us in trusting Him,
revering Him, following Him, and acclaiming Him as Lord.
