Snapping, Snarling Thoughts

You have been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble. —
Psalm 59:16

Today's Scripture: Psalm 59

Many years ago, my father and I hiked through Big Bend in Texas. It’s
a national park now, but in those days it was rough country.

One night we were rolling out our sleeping bags when a couple with a
dog asked if they could camp nearby. We welcomed their company and
turned in for the night. They tethered their dog to a stake beside
their tent.

Some hours later my father nudged me awake and turned his flashlight
into the darkness. Illuminated by the light, we saw pairs of yellow
eyes peering out of the shadows. A pack of snapping and snarling
coyotes were closing in on the dog. Although we chased them off and
our neighbors put the dog in their tent, we slept fitfully.

I think of that night when I read Psalm 59 and David’s twice-repeated
imagery: “At evening they return, they growl like a dog” (vv.6,14).
David was thinking of Saul’s army that was closing in on him. I think,
however, of the thoughts that return to menace us. They come back at
nightfall, snapping and snarling: “You’re stupid.” “You’re a failure.”
“You’re useless.” “Who needs you?”

When we have such thoughts, we can revel in God’s unconditional,
unending love. His steady devotion is our refuge in the dark night of
self-doubt and fear (v.16).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, I am so thankful that You love me unconditionally. Please
chase away destructive thoughts that keep returning to take away my
confidence in You and Your work in me. I want to rest in You and Your
love.

Knowing that God loves us can dispel doubt.
