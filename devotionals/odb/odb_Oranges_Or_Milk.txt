Oranges Or Milk?

Solid food belongs to those who are of full age. —
Hebrews 5:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 5:5-14

When I told my young daughter that a 3-month-old baby boy was coming
to our house for a visit, she was delighted. With a child’s sense of
hospitality, she suggested that we share some of our food with the
baby; she thought he might enjoy a juicy orange from the bowl on our
kitchen counter. I explained that the baby could drink only milk, but
that he might like oranges when he was older.

The Bible uses a similar concept to describe a believer’s need for
spiritual food. The basic truths of Scripture are like milk—they help
new Christians thrive and grow (1 Peter 2:2-3). In contrast, “Solid
food belongs to those who are of full age” (Heb. 5:14). Believers who
have had time to digest and understand the basics can move on to
investigate other biblical concepts and begin to teach others these
truths. The rewards of spiritual maturity are discernment (v.14),
godly wisdom (1 Cor. 2:6), and the ability to communicate God’s truth
to others (Heb. 5:12).

Like a loving parent, God wants us to grow spiritually. He knows that
feeding only on spiritual milk is not in our best interest. He wants
us to move on so we can enjoy the taste of solid food.
