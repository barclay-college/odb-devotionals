Peace-Filled Hearts

A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.
Proverbs 14:30

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 14:29–35

For forty-five years after his career as a professional athlete ended,
Jerry Kramer wasn’t inducted into his sport’s hall of fame (the
highest recognition). He enjoyed many other honors and achievements,
but this one eluded him. Although he’d been nominated for the honor
ten times, it had never been bestowed. Despite having his hopes dashed
so many times, Kramer was gracious, saying, “I felt like [the National
Football League] had given me 100 presents in my lifetime and to be
upset or angry about one I didn’t get was kind of stupid!”

Where others might have grown bitter after being denied so many times
in favor of other players, Kramer wasn’t. His attitude illustrates the
way we can safeguard our hearts against the corrosive nature of envy,
which “rots the bones” (Proverbs 14:30). When we become preoccupied
with what we don’t have—and fail to recognize the many things we
do—the peace of God will elude us.

After an eleventh nomination, Jerry Kramer ultimately was inducted
into the NFL Hall of Fame in February 2018. Our earthly desires may
not be fulfilled as his finally were. Yet we can all have a “heart at
peace” when we instead focus our attention on the many ways God has
been generous toward us. No matter what we want but do not have, we
can always enjoy the life-giving peace He brings to our lives.

In what area of life are you tempted to focus on what you don’t have?
What steps can you take this week to focus on what God has provided?

God gives our hearts peace and so much more.
