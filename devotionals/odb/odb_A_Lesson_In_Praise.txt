A Lesson In Praise

Praise the Lord! —
Psalm 150:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 150

Psalm 150 is not only a beautiful expression of praise, it’s also a
lesson in praising the Lord. It tells us where to praise, why we’re to
praise, how we’re to praise, and who should offer praise.

Where do we praise? In God’s “sanctuary” and “mighty firmament” (v.1).
Wherever we are in the world is a proper place to praise the One who
created all things.

Why do we praise? First, because of what God does. He performs “mighty
acts.” Second, because of who God is. The psalmist praised Him for
“His excellent greatness” (v.2). The all-powerful Creator is the
Sustainer of the universe.

How should we praise? Loudly. Softly. Soothingly. Enthusiastically.
Rhythmically. Boldly. Unexpectedly. Fearlessly. In other words, we can
praise God in many ways and on many occasions (vv.3-5).

Who should praise? “Everything that has breath” (v.6). Young and old.
Rich and poor. Weak and strong. Every living creature. God’s will is
for everyone to whom He gave the breath of life to use that breath to
acknowledge His power and greatness.

Praise is our enthusiastic expression of gratitude to God for reigning
in glory forever.

Reflect & Pray

Let every creature rise and bring Peculiar honors to our King; Angels
descend with songs again, And earth repeat the loud amen! —Watts

Praise is the overflow of a joyful heart.
