What Is It?

When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?”
Exodus 16:15

Today's Scripture: Exodus 16:11-31

My mother taught Sunday school for decades. One week she wanted to
explain how God supplied food for the Israelites in the wilderness. To
make the story come alive, she created something to represent “manna”
for the kids in her class. She cut bread into small pieces and topped
them with honey. Her recipe was inspired by the Bible’s description of
manna that says it “tasted like wafers made with honey” (Ex. 16:31).

When the Israelites first encountered God’s bread from heaven, it
appeared on the ground outside their tents like frost. “When [they]
saw it, they said to each other, ‘What is it?’ ” (v. 15). The Hebrew
word man means “what,” so they called it manna. They discovered they
could grind it and form it into loaves or cook it in a pot (Num.
11:7-8). Whatever it was, it had a baffling arrival (Ex. 16:4,14), a
unique consistency (v. 14), and a short expiration date (vv. 19-20).

Sometimes God provides for us in surprising ways. This reminds us that
He is not bound by our expectations, and we can’t predict what He will
choose to do. While we wait, focusing on who He is rather than what we
think He should do will help us find joy and satisfaction in our
relationship with Him.
