Seeds & Soils

Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. —
2 Peter 3:18

Today's Scripture: Matthew 13:1-9

If you like growing pumpkins, you have probably heard of Dill’s
Atlantic Giant variety of premium pumpkin seeds. Developed on a family
farm in Atlantic Canada, the pumpkins grown from these seeds have set
records around the world. In 2011, a pumpkin grown in Quebec set a new
world record at 1,818.5 pounds (825 kg). That size of pumpkin could
yield almost 1,000 pieces of pie!

When news reporters asked how this pumpkin could grow to such a size,
the farmer replied that it had to do with the soil. The seeds were of
a special large variety, but the soil still had to be right or the
pumpkin wouldn’t grow properly.

The Lord Jesus used an illustration in which He compared different
types of ground to a person’s response to God’s Word (Matt. 13). Some
seeds were eaten by the birds, others started to grow but were choked
by the weeds, and some grew up instantly but had no soil to further
their growth. But the seeds that fell on the good soil “yielded a
crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty” (v.8).

Each of us needs to ask, “What kind of soil am I?” The Lord wants to
plant His Word in our hearts so we can grow in our knowledge of Him.

The fruit of the Spirit grows in the soil of obedience.
