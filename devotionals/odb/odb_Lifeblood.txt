Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
Hebrews 9:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 9:19-28

Mary Ann believed in God and His Son Jesus, but she struggled with why
Jesus had to shed His blood to bring salvation. Who would think of
cleansing something with blood? Yet the Bible says, “The law requires
that nearly everything be cleansed with blood” (Heb. 9:22). That, in
Mary Ann’s opinion, was disgusting!

Then one day she had to go to a hospital. A genetic condition had
altered her immune system, and doctors became alarmed when the illness
started attacking her blood. As she was in the emergency room she
thought, If I lose my blood, I will die. But Jesus shed His blood so I
can live!

Suddenly everything made sense. In the midst of her pain, Mary Ann
felt joy and peace. She understood that blood is life, and a holy life
was needed to make peace with God for us. Today she is alive and well,
thanking God for her health and for Jesus’ sacrifice on her behalf.

Hebrews 9 explains the meaning of the Old Testament blood ritual (vv.
16-22) and the once and for all offering of Jesus that brought animal
sacrifice to an end (vv. 23-26). Bearing our sin, He willingly died
and shed His blood to become our sacrifice. We now have confidence to
enter God’s presence. How could we ever thank Jesus enough for making
His sacrifice our sacrifice, His life our life, and His Father our
Father?

I want to live my life in gratitude to You.

The blood of Christ washes away our sins.
