Retirement Time

Whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. —
Matthew 16:25

Today's Scripture: Matthew 16:24-28

After working for 40 years as a teacher, Jane Hanson retired. She and
her husband were looking forward to the arrival of their first
grandchild.

Retirement is that time of life when many people simply relax, travel,
or enjoy hobbies. But Jane heard about a ministry to at-risk youth in
a city near her home, and she knew she had to get involved. “I
realized there are kids just waiting, and I could make a difference,”
she said. She began teaching English to a young Liberian man who had
been forced to flee his home country because of civil war. Though he
was in a safe environment, he didn’t understand the new language. Of
this ministry opportunity, Jane said with a smile, “I could just go
shopping to stay busy, but what fun would that be?”

Jane is making a difference. Perhaps she has learned a little of what
Jesus meant when He said, “Whoever desires to save his life will lose
it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it” (Matt.
16:25). Giving ourselves to the Lord through helping others takes
self-denial, yet one day Jesus will reward that effort (v.27).

Let’s follow Jane’s example of love for God and others—no matter what
our stage of life may be.

Reflect & Pray

Oh, let us be faithful to Jesus, The faith we confessed let’s renew,
And ask Him this question each morning: “Lord, what will You have me
to do?” —Pangborn

Work for the Lord—His retirement plan is out of this world.
