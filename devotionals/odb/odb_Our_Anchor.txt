Our Anchor

This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast. —
Hebrews 6:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 6:13-20

After Estella Pyfrom retired from teaching, she bought a bus, decked
it out with computers and desks, and now drives the “Brilliant Bus”
through Palm Beach County, Florida, providing a place for at-risk
children to do their homework and learn technology. Estella is
providing stability and hope to children who might be tempted to throw
away their dream for a better tomorrow.

In the first century, an avalanche of suffering and discouragement
threatened the Christian community. The author of Hebrews wrote to
convince these followers of Christ not to throw away their confidence
in their future hope (2:1). Their hope—a faith in God for salvation
and entrance into heaven—was found in the person and sacrifice of
Christ. When Jesus entered heaven after His resurrection, He secured
their hope for the future (6:19-20). Like an anchor dropped at sea,
preventing a ship from drifting away, Jesus’ death, resurrection, and
return to heaven brought assurance and stability to the believers’
lives. This hope for the future cannot and will not be shaken loose.

Jesus anchors our souls, so that we will not drift away from our hope
in God.

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, in the face of all kinds of trouble and uncertainty, help me to
have a confident expectation that is grounded in Your unfailing love
for me.

Our hope is anchored in Jesus.
