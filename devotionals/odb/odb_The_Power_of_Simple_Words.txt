The Power of Simple Words

We did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of
his majesty.
2 Peter 1:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Peter 1:12–21

Raucous laughter marked the guests in my father’s hospital room: Two
old truck drivers, one former country/western singer, one craftsman,
two women from neighboring farms, and me.

“…and then he got up and busted the bottle over my head,” the
craftsman said, finishing his story about a bar fight.

The room bursts into laughter at this now-humorous memory. Dad,
struggling for breath as his laughing fought with his cancer for the
air in his lungs, puffs out a reminder to everybody that “Randy is a
preacher” so they need to watch what they say. Everything got quiet
for about two seconds, then the whole room exploded as this news makes
them laugh harder and louder.

Suddenly, about forty minutes into this visit, the craftsman clears
his throat, turns to my dad, and gets serious. “No more drinking and
bar fights for me, Howard. Those days are behind me. Now I have a
different reason to live. I want to tell you about my Savior.”

He then proceeded to do just that, over my father’s surprisingly mild
protests.  If there’s a sweeter, gentler way to present the gospel
message, I’ve never heard it.

My dad listened and watched, and some years later believed in Jesus
too.

It was a simple testimony from an old friend living a simple life,
reminding me again that simple isn’t naïve or stupid; it’s direct and
unpretentious.

Just like Jesus. And salvation.
