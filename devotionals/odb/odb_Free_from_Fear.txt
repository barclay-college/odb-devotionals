Free from Fear

I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my
fears.
Psalm 34:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:1–10

Fear sneaks into my heart without permission. It paints a picture of
helplessness and hopelessness. It steals my peace and my
concentration. What am I fearful about? I’m concerned about the safety
of my family or the health of loved ones. I panic at the loss of a job
or a broken relationship. Fear turns my focus inward and reveals a
heart that sometimes finds it hard to trust.

When these fears and worries strike, how good it is to read David’s
prayer in Psalm 34: “I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he
delivered me from all my fears” (v. 4). And how does God deliver us
from our fears? When we “look to him” (v. 5), when we focus on Him,
our fears fade; we trust Him to be in control. Then David mentions a
different type of fear—not a fear that paralyzes, but a deep respect
and awe of the One who surrounds us and delivers us (v. 7). We can
take refuge in Him because He is good (v. 8).

This awe of His goodness helps put our fears into perspective. When we
remember who God is and how much He loves us, we can relax into His
peace. “Those who fear him lack nothing” (v. 9), concludes David. How
wonderful to discover that in the fear of the Lord we can be delivered
from our fears.
