Drink Lots Of Water

The water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water
springing up into everlasting life. —
John 4:14

Today's Scripture: John 4:7-14

Visitors to Colorado often become dehydrated without realizing it. The
dry climate and intense sun, especially in the mountains, can rapidly
deplete the body’s fluids. That’s why many tourist maps and signs urge
people to drink plenty of water.

In the Bible, water is often used as a symbol of Jesus as the Living
Water who satisfies our deepest needs. So it’s quite fitting that one
of Jesus’ most memorable conversations took place at a well (John
4:1-42). It began with Jesus asking a Samaritan woman for a drink of
water (v.7). It quickly progressed to a discussion of something more
when Jesus said to her: “Whoever drinks of this [physical] water will
thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him
will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in
him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life”
(vv.13-14).

As a result of this conversation, the woman and many people in the
village where she lived came to believe that Jesus was “the Christ,
the Savior of the world” (v.42).

We can’t live without water. Nor can we truly live now or eternally
without the living water we receive from knowing Jesus Christ as our
Savior. We can drink of His life-giving water today.

Gracious and Almighty Savior, Source of all that shall endure, Quench
my thirst with living water, Living water, clear and pure. —Vinal

Only Jesus, the Living Water, can satisfy the thirsty soul.
