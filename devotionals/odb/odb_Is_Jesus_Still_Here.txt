Is Jesus Still Here?

[Nothing] shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is
in Christ Jesus our Lord. —
Romans 8:38-39

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:31-39

Ted Robertson’s home in Colorado was one of more than 500 destroyed by
the Black Forest Fire in June 2013. When he was allowed to return and
sift through the ash and rubble, he was hoping to find a precious
family heirloom made by his wife—a tiny ceramic figurine of baby Jesus
about the size of a postage stamp. As he searched the charred remains
of their home, he kept wondering, “Is the baby Jesus still here?”

When our lives are rocked by disappointment and loss, we may wonder if
Jesus is still here with us. The Bible’s answer is a resounding Yes!
“Neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor
things present nor things to come . . . shall be able to separate us
from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom.
8:38-39).

In a corner of what used to be his garage, Ted Robertson discovered
the burned remnants of a nativity scene and there he found the baby
Jesus figurine undamaged by the flames. He told KRDO NewsChannel 13,
“[We’ve] gone from apprehension to hope . . . that we’re going to
recover some parts of our life that we thought were lost.”

Is Jesus still here? He is indeed, and that is the everlasting wonder
of Christmas.

Reflect & Pray

When all around me is darkness And earthly joys have flown, My Savior
whispers His promise Never to leave me alone. —Anon.

If you know Jesus, you’ll never walk alone.
