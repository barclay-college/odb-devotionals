Place Of Water

The water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water
springing up into everlasting life. —
John 4:14

Today's Scripture: Psalm 42:1-5

East Africa is one of the driest places on earth, which is what makes
“Nairobi” such a significant name for a city in that region. The name
comes from a Masai phrase meaning “cold water,” and it literally means
“the place of water.”

Throughout history, the presence of water has been both life-giving
and strategic. Whether a person lives in a dry climate or a
rainforest, water is a nonnegotiable necessity. In a dry and barren
climate, knowing where to find the place of water can mean the
difference between life and death.

Our spiritual life also has certain nonnegotiable elements. That is
why Jesus, upon encountering a spiritually thirsty woman at a well,
declared to her that He alone could provide living water. He told her,
“Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst.
But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of
water springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:14).

Like the deer mentioned in Psalm 42:1-2 who pants for water, our souls
thirst for God and long for Him (63:1). We desperately need the
sustenance that comes only from Jesus Christ. He is the source of
living water that refreshes our hearts.
