The Wrong Horseshoe

Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days, keep your
tongue from evil.
Psalm 34:12–13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:11–18

Napoleon’s defeat in Russia 200 years ago was attributed to the harsh
Russian winter. One specific problem was that his horses were wearing
summer horseshoes. When winter came, these horses died because they
slipped on icy roads as they pulled the supply wagons. The failure of
Napoleon’s supply chain reduced his 400,000-strong army to just
10,000. A small slip; a disastrous result!

James described how a slip of the tongue can do great damage. One
wrong word can change the careers or destinies of people. So toxic is
the tongue that James wrote, “No human being can tame the tongue. It
is a restless evil, full of deadly poison” (James 3:8). The problem
has increased in our modern world as a careless email or a posting on
a social media site can cause great harm. It quickly goes viral and
can’t always be retracted.

King David tied respect for the Lord with the way we use our words. He
wrote, “I will teach you the fear of the Lord. . . . Keep your tongue
from evil and your lips from telling lies” (Ps. 34:11, 13). He
resolved, “I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will
put a muzzle on my mouth” (39:1). Lord, help us to do the same.

Reflect & Pray

What do James 3:1–12 and Proverbs 18:1–8 teach you about a slip of the
tongue?

Our words have the power to build up or tear down.
