The Ticking Watch

Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him.
Psalm 37:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 37:1–7

A group of workers were cutting ice out of a frozen lake and storing
it in an icehouse when one of them realized he’d lost his watch in the
windowless building. He and his friends searched for it in vain.

After they gave up, a young boy who’d seen them exit went into the
building. Soon, he emerged with the watch. Asked how he’d found it, he
replied: “I just sat down and kept quiet, and soon I could hear it
ticking.”

The Bible talks much about the value of being still. And no wonder,
for God sometimes speaks in a whisper (1 Kings 19:12). In the busyness
of life, it can be hard to hear Him. But if we stop rushing about and
spend some quiet time with Him and the Scriptures, we may hear His
gentle voice in our thoughts.

Psalm 37:1–7 assures us that we can trust God to rescue us from the
“wicked schemes” of evil people, give us refuge, and help us stay
faithful. But how can we do this when turmoil is all around us?

Verse 7 suggests: “Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for
him.” We could start by learning to keep silent for a few minutes
after prayer. Or by quietly reading the Bible and letting the words
soak into our hearts. And then, perhaps, we’ll hear His wisdom
speaking to us, quiet and steady as a ticking watch.

Reflect & Pray

How can you be still before God each day? What will help you stay
silent and listen?

Loving God, grant me the patience and discipline to stay still for a
while each day, that I might hear Your gentle whisper in my life.
