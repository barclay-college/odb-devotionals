The Go-Between

The people stood afar off, but Moses drew near . . . where God was. —
Exodus 20:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 20:18-26

Imagine standing at the bottom of a mountain, elbow-to-elbow with
everyone in your community. Thunder and lightning flash; you hear an
earsplitting trumpet blast. Amid flames, God descends on the
mountaintop. The summit is enveloped in smoke; the entire mountain
begins to shake, and so do you (Ex. 19:16-20).

When the Israelites had this terrifying experience near Mount Sinai,
they begged Moses, “You speak with us, and we will hear; but let not
God speak with us, lest we die” (20:19). The Israelites were asking
Moses to mediate between them and the Almighty. “So the people stood
afar off, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God was”
(v.21). After meeting with God, Moses brought God’s messages back down
the mountain to the people below.

Today, we worship the same God who displayed His staggering greatness
on Mount Sinai. Because God is perfectly holy and we are desperately
sinful, we cannot relate to Him. Left to ourselves we too would (and
should) shake in terror. But Jesus made it possible for us to know God
when He took our sins on Himself, died, and rose again (1 Cor.
15:3-4). Even now, Jesus is the go-between for us to a holy and
perfect God (Rom. 8:34; 1 Tim. 2:5).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Jesus, thank You for laying down Your life so that I could know
God. I worship You as the only one who bridges the gap between God and
me.

Jesus bridges the gap between God and us.
