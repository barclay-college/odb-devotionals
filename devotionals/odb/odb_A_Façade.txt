A Façade

Give your gifts in private, and your Father, who sees everything, will
reward you.
Matthew 6:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:1–6

Kerri tries hard to get people to admire her. She acts happy most of
the time so that others will notice and compliment her on her joyful
attitude. Some affirm her because they see her helping people in the
community. But in a transparent moment Kerri will admit, “I love the
Lord, but in some ways I feel like my life is a façade.” Her own sense
of insecurity is behind much of her effort of trying to look good to
others, and she says she’s running out of energy to keep it up.

We can probably all relate in some way because it’s not possible to
have perfect motives. We love the Lord and others, but our motives for
how we live the Christian life are sometimes mixed with our desire to
be valued or praised.

Jesus talked about those who give, pray, and fast in order to be seen
(Matt. 6:1–18). He taught in the Sermon on the Mount to “give your
gifts in private,” to “pray to your Father in private,” and “when you
fast, don’t make it obvious” (vv. 4, 6, 16 nlt).

Serving is most often done publicly, but maybe a little anonymous
service could help us learn to rest in God’s opinion of us. He who
created us in His image values us so much that He gave us His Son and
shows us His love each day.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, please forgive me for desiring praise from others more than
from You. Please help me as I struggle to keep my motives pure.

Our desire to please God should be our highest motive for obeying God.
