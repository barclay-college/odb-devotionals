Heartbreak And Hope

The Lord is good to those who wait for Him. —
Lamentations 3:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Lamentations 3:1-6, 16-25

When American country singer George Jones died at the age of 81, his
fans remembered his remarkable voice and his hard life and personal
struggles. While many of his songs reflected his own despair and
longing, it was the way he sang them that touched people deeply.
Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot said, “His voice was made for
conveying heartbreak.”

The book of Lamentations records Jeremiah’s anguish over the nation of
Judah’s stubborn refusal to follow God. Often called “the weeping
prophet,” he witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and saw his people
carried into captivity. He wandered the streets of the city,
overwhelmed by grief (Lam. 1:1-5).

Yet, in Jeremiah’s darkest hour, he said, “This I recall to my mind,
therefore I have hope. Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed,
because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is
Your faithfulness” (3:21-23).

Whether we suffer for our own choices or from those of others, despair
may threaten to overwhelm us. When all seems lost, we can cling to the
Lord’s faithfulness. “‘The Lord is my portion,’ says my soul.
‘Therefore I hope in Him!’” (v.24).

Reflect & Pray

I’m thankful for Your faithfulness, Father, even in the times when I
am unfaithful. Help me to remember, like Jeremiah, that my hope comes
from You, not from my circumstances.

The anchor of God’s faithfulness holds firm in the strongest storms.
