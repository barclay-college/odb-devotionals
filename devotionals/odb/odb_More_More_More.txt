More, More, More

Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist
in the abundance of the things he possesses. —
Luke 12:15

Today's Scripture: Luke 12:13-21

Some people love to shop. They have a perpetual desire to buy, buy,
buy. The craze to find the latest deal is worldwide. There are huge
shopping malls in China, Saudi Arabia, Canada, the Philippines, the
United States, and around the world. A rise in store purchases and
online buying show that buying is a global phenomenon.

Shopping can be fun. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with trying to
find a real deal and to enjoy the things God has given to us. But when
we become preoccupied with obtaining material goods, we lose focus.

Jesus challenged His listeners with these words: “Take heed and beware
of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of
the things he possesses” (Luke 12:15). He went on to tell a parable
about a man “who lays up treasure for himself,” but is not concerned
about his relationship with God (v.21).

How can we learn to be content with what we have and not be consumed
with amassing more? Here are some ways: View material goods as given
by God to be used wisely (Matt. 25:14-30). Work hard to earn and save
money (Prov. 6:6-11). Give to the Lord’s work and those in need (2
Cor. 9:7; Prov. 19:17). And always remember to be thankful and to
enjoy what God gives (1 Tim. 6:17).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, our hearts often run after “stuff.” Teach us not to be obsessed
with collecting more and more material goods. May we instead learn
what it means to be “rich” toward You.

To be rich in God is far better than to be rich in goods.
