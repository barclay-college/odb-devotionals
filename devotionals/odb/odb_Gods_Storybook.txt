God’s Storybook

God blessed them. . . . God saw all that he had made, and it was very
good.
Genesis 1:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 1:26–31

Wanting to enjoy the beautiful day, I headed out for a walk and soon
met a new neighbor. He stopped me and introduced himself: “My name is
Genesis, and I’m six and a half years old.”

“Genesis is a great name! It’s a book in the Bible,” I replied.

“What’s the Bible?” he asked.

“It’s God’s storybook about how He made the world and people and how
He loves us.”

His inquisitive response made me smile: “Why did He make the world and
people and cars and houses? And is my picture in His book?”

While there isn’t a literal picture of my new friend Genesis or the
rest of us in the Scriptures, we’re a big part of God’s storybook. We
see in Genesis 1 that “God created mankind in his own image, in the
image of God He created them” (v. 27). God walked with them in the
garden, and then warned about giving in to the temptation to be their
own god (ch. 3). Later in His book, God told about how, in love, His
Son, Jesus, came to walk with us again and brought about a plan for
our forgiveness and the restoration of His creation.

As we look at the Bible, we learn that our Creator wants us to know
Him, talk with Him, and even ask Him our questions. He cares for us
more than we can imagine.
