Walking Billboards

We are ambassadors for Christ. —
2 Corinthians 5:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 5:16-21

Pete Peterson’s first contact with Vietnam was in the Vietnam War.
During a bombing raid in 1966, his plane was shot down and he was
taken prisoner. Over 30 years later he returned as US Ambassador to
Vietnam. One press article called him “a walking billboard for
reconciliation.” He realized years ago that God had not saved his life
for him to live in anger. Because he believed this, he used the rest
of his life and his position to make a difference by pushing for
better safety standards for children in Vietnam.

It is a great responsibility and honor to be appointed as a
representative of your country to another. As followers of Christ we
are “ambassadors for Christ” (2 Cor. 5:20). Just as God sent Christ to
reconcile us to Himself (v.18), we now have the ministry of
“reconciliation” (v.19). Our message is that all can be redeemed in
Christ because God “made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we
might become the righteousness of God in Him” (v.21).

In response to the reconciling love Jesus offers us, we can share that
love with others. Let’s take our role seriously. Wherever God places
us in this world, He can use us as walking billboards of
reconciliation for Jesus Christ.

Reflect & Pray

I am a stranger here, within a foreign land; My home is far away, upon
a golden strand, Ambassador to be of realms beyond the sea, I’m here
on business for the King! —Cassel

Good news kept silent is no news at all.
