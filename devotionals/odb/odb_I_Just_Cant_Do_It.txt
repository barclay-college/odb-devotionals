I Just Can’t Do It

The law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be
justified by faith.
Galatians 3:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 1:26–31

“I just can’t do it!” lamented the dejected student. On the page he
could see only small print, difficult ideas, and an unforgiving
deadline. He needed the help of his teacher.

We might experience similar despair when we read Jesus’s Sermon on the
Mount. “Love your enemies” (Matthew 5:44). Anger is as bad as murder
(v. 22). Lust equals adultery (v. 28). And if we dare think we can
live up to these standards, we bump into this: “Be perfect, therefore,
as your heavenly Father is perfect” (v. 48).

“The Sermon on the Mount produces despair,” says Oswald Chambers. But
he saw this as good, because at “the point of despair we are willing
to come to [Jesus] as paupers to receive from Him.”

In the counterintuitive way God so often works, those who know they
can’t do it on their own are the ones who receive God’s grace. As the
apostle Paul put it, “Not many of you were wise by human standards. .
. . But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise”
(1 Corinthians 1:26–27).

In God’s wisdom, the Teacher is also our Savior. When we come to Him
in faith, through His Spirit we enjoy His “righteousness, holiness and
redemption” (v. 30), and the grace and power to live for Him. That’s
why He could say, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 5:3).

Thank You, Lord, for blessing those who are poor in spirit, who mourn,
and who hunger and thirst for Your righteousness. You are our
righteousness! Read more from Oswald Chambers at utmost.org.

Through the Son we can enjoy life in God’s kingdom.
