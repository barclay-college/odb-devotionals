Who’s Driving?

Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
Galatians 5:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 6:1–14

My neighbor Tim has a figurine on his dashboard of a “wild thing”
based on Maurice Sendak’s beloved children’s book Where the Wild
Things Are.

Not long ago Tim was following me through traffic and made some abrupt
moves to keep up. When we arrived, I asked, “Was that the ‘wild thing’
driving?”

The following Sunday I forgot my sermon notes at home. I “flew” out of
the church to retrieve them, passing Tim along the way. When we met
later, he joked, “Was that the wild thing driving?” We laughed, but
his point hit home—I should have paid attention to the speed limit.

When the Bible describes what it means to live in a relationship with
God, it encourages us to “offer every part of [ourselves]” to Him
(Romans 6:13). I took Tim’s response to me that day as a gentle
reminder from God to yield my “lead foot,” because I am to give all of
myself to Him out of love.

The question of “who’s driving?” applies to all of life. Do we let the
“wild things” of our old sin nature drive us—like worry, fear, or
self-will—or do we yield to God’s loving Spirit and the grace that
helps us grow?

Giving in to God is good for us. Scripture says that God’s wisdom
takes us down “pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace” (Proverbs
3:17). Better to follow where He leads.
