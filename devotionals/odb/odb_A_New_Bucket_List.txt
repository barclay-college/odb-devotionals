A New Bucket List

Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor
giving preference to one another. —
Romans 12:10

Today's Scripture: Romans 12:6-21

Afriend told me he had recently accomplished one of the things on his
“bucket list” (a list of things to do before you die) when he took his
sister to Europe. Although he had traveled there many times, she had
never been there. What struck me was the unselfish nature of having
that goal on his “bucket list.” It caused me to wonder how many of my
dreams and goals are focused on others, not on myself.

Romans 12:6-21 speaks of God’s gifts to us as members of the body of
Christ and how we should use them in everyday life. All of them are
outward in focus. Teaching, for example, is not for the teacher’s
self-fulfillment but for the benefit of others. So too with the other
gifts mentioned in verses 6 through 8. Paul summarized this openhanded
approach by urging us to “be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
Honor one another above yourselves” (v.10 niv).

Paul exemplified this attitude by including others in his ministry and
investing his life in the next generation of believers. Generosity,
hospitality, forgiveness, and compassion guided his behavior.

Our goals in life should include giving away the gifts God has given
to us.
