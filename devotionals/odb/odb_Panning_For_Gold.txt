Panning For Gold

The genuineness of your faith [is] much more precious than gold. —
1 Peter 1:7

Today's Scripture: Luke 18:18-30

While on vacation in Alaska, we visited the El Dorado Gold Mine near
Fairbanks. After a tour and demonstrations of mining techniques during
Gold Rush days, we got to do a little panning for gold. Each person
was given a pan and a bag of dirt and stones. After pouring the
contents into the pan, we added water from a trough and swirled it
around to stir up the silt and allow the gold, which is heavy, to sink
to the bottom. Even though we had watched experts, we made little
progress. The reason? Concerned about discarding something of value,
we were unwilling to throw away worthless stones.

This reminded me of how possessions sometimes keep us from finding
what is truly valuable. Jesus had an encounter with a rich man for
whom this was true. His earthly wealth was more important to him than
spiritual treasure (Luke 18:18-30). Jesus said, “How hard it is for
those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!” (v.24).

Although money is not evil, it can prevent us from inheriting true
riches if accumulating it is the goal of our lives. To hoard wealth is
foolish, for it is genuine faith, not gold, that will sustain us
through trials and result in praise, honor, and glory to God (1 Peter
1:7).
