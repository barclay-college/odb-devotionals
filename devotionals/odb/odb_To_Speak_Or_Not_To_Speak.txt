To Speak Or Not To Speak

[Jesus] kept silent and answered nothing. —
Mark 14:61

Today's Scripture: Mark 14:53-65

Sometimes silence is the best response to a false charge. At other
times we must speak up.

When false witnesses accused Jesus as He stood before the Sanhedrin,
He “kept silent” (Mark 14:53-61). Defending Himself would have been
useless. Furthermore, He was fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah 53:7.
But earlier in His ministry, Jesus rebuked the Pharisees, challenging
them to prove that He sinned (John 8:13-59).

A pastor resigned from his church because a few members made untrue
statements about him. He thought it unchristian to defend himself, and
in some instances it is. But in this case, the troublemakers needed to
be confronted and their false charges refuted. He should have urged
them to repent or face church discipline.

Saying nothing may allow wrongdoers to go unchallenged in their evil
ways. But if God’s Spirit leads us to remain silent, or if we want
merely to try to salvage our wounded pride, then we should hold our
tongue.

Are you being falsely accused? If you discern that it’s futile to
argue, or if your pride has been hurt, ask God for grace to say
nothing. But if you feel concern for the wrongdoers and want to see
justice done, speak up!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give us wisdom to discern When what is false must be revealed Or
if we need Your grace and strength To close our lips and keep them
sealed. —D. De Haan

Silence can be valuable; don’t break it unless you can improve on it.
