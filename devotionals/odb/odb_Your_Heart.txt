Your Heart

I sat down and wept, and mourned for many days; I was fasting and
praying before the God of heaven. —
Nehemiah 1:4

Today's Scripture: Nehemiah 1

I loved Malcom’s prayer at church the other day. Only 7 years old, he
stood in front of 100 other kids and prayed: “Jesus, thank You that
some of us get to play football and go to church, and for safety on
the ride here, and for forgiveness of our sins, and for eternal life.
We love You, Jesus. Please don’t ever forget how much we love You!”

It brought tears to my eyes as he expressed his heart to God. As
adults, we may tend to try to polish our prayers a little, thinking
that it will sound better to God’s ears or to those around us who
might hear us. But I think God must delight in hearing just what’s on
His child’s heart.

Nehemiah’s heart was filled with concern for the welfare of Jerusalem,
his homeland, when he heard that the people were in great distress and
that the wall around the city was broken down (Neh. 1:3). Wanting to
do something, he talked to God about it. He praised God for who He is
(v.5), requested forgiveness for sin (v.6), reminded Him of His
promise (v.9), and asked for mercy from the king (v.11). God watched
over Nehemiah and His people through the whole rebuilding process.

What is on your mind? Thanks or burdens? Whatever it is, your loving
God wants to hear your heart.

Reflect & Pray

So lift up your heart to the heavens; There’s a loving and kind Father
there Who offers release and comfort and peace In the silent communion
of prayer. —Anon.

The highest form of prayer comes from the depths of a humble heart.
