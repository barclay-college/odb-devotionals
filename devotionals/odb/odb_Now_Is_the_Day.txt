Now Is the Day

I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of
salvation.
2 Corinthians 6:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 5:18–6:2

Our preschool-age granddaughter Maggie and her kindergarten-age sister
Katie hauled several blankets to the backyard, where they proceeded to
build a blanket tent in which to play. They had been outside a while
when their mom heard Maggie call for her.

“Mom, come here quick!” Maggie yelled. “I want to ask Jesus into my
heart, and I need your help!” Apparently at that moment her need for
Jesus became clear to her, and she was ready to put her faith in Him.

Maggie’s urgent call for help in trusting Jesus brings to mind Paul’s
words in 2 Corinthians 6 about salvation. He was discussing the
reality that Jesus Christ’s coming—including His death and
resurrection—instituted an era he called “the time of God’s favor.” We
live in that time, and salvation is available to all right now. He
said, “I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of
salvation” (v. 2). For all who have not yet trusted Jesus for
forgiveness, the time to do so is now. It is urgent.

Perhaps the Holy Spirit has alerted you to your need to put your trust
in Jesus. Like Maggie, don’t put it off. Run to Jesus. Now is the day!

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, I now understand my need to have my sins forgiven. I
also realize that only Jesus—because of His sacrifice on the cross—can
forgive my sin. I put my faith and trust in Jesus today. Please
forgive me and become the Lord of my life.

There’s no better day than today to enter into God’s family.
