The Circle Of The Wise

I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the
beginning. —
1 John 2:13

Today's Scripture: 1 John 2:12–17

I used to serve on the elder board of a church in California. One
elder, Bob Smith, who was older than most of us, frequently called us
back to the Word of God for guidance.

On one occasion we were discussing a leadership shortage in the church
and had spent an hour or more working through various solutions. Bob
was silent throughout the discussion. Finally, he said quietly,
“Gentlemen, we’ve forgotten Jesus’ solution to our leadership issue.
Before we do anything, we must first ‘ask the Lord of the harvest . .
. to send out workers’” (Luke 10:2 niv). We were humbled, and spent
the rest of our time praying that God would raise up workers and send
them into the field.

C. S. Lewis said, “The next best thing to being wise oneself is to
live in a circle of those who are.” Proverbs 1:5 says, “A man of
understanding will attain wise counsel.” Bob’s comment is just one
example of the value of wise men and women who “have known Him who is
from the beginning” (1 John 2:13-14) and whose minds are saturated
with the Word of God.

Let’s take to heart the counsel of those who have lived in the Lord’s
presence and are mature in His wisdom. They are God’s gift to us and
our churches.

Reflect & Pray

The older saints who trust God’s Word Have trod the paths that we now
walk; They’ve fought the battles we now fight— Their wisdom teaches
truth and right. —Branon

That one is truly wise who gains wisdom from the experience of others.
