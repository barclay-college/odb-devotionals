Not Like Yesterday

Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the
mouth of the Lord.
Deuteronomy 8:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 4:1–11

When our grandson Jay was a child his parents gave him a new T-shirt
for his birthday. He put it on right away and proudly wore it all day.

When he appeared the next morning in the shirt, his dad asked him,
“Jay, does that shirt make you happy?”

“Not as much as yesterday,” Jay replied.

That’s the problem with material acquisition: Even the good things of
life can’t give us the deep, lasting happiness we so strongly desire.
Though we may have many possessions, we may still be unhappy.

The world offers happiness through material accumulation: new clothes,
a new automobile, an update to our phone or watch. But no material
acquisition can make us as happy as it did yesterday. That’s because
we were made for God and nothing less will do.

One day, when Jesus was fasting and faint with hunger, Satan
approached Him and tempted Him to satisfy His hunger by creating
bread. Jesus countered by quoting from Deuteronomy 8:3: “Man shall not
live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of
God” (Matthew 4:4).

Jesus didn’t mean that we shouldn’t live only on bread. He’s rather
stating a fact: We’re spiritual beings and thus we can’t exist on
material goods alone.

True satisfaction is found in God and His riches.

Reflect & Pray

Why do material acquisitions not provide long-term happiness? What
have you learned from past expectations?

Teach me, God, what it means to live by Your riches today. You possess
all I truly need!
