Honoring Your Parents

Honor your father and mother. —
Ephesians 6:2

Today's Scripture: Exodus 20:1-17

My dad recently turned 90 years old and his physical capabilities are
fading. He can still move around with his walker, but he needs someone
to cook his meals and help him with other tasks.

My older brother Steve and his wife Judy lived close to him, so they
decided to move in with Dad to care for him. Wanting to help in some
way, my wife and I flew across the country to help out a bit by
watching Dad while my brother and his wife had some time away
together. We enjoyed our time with my father and were glad to ease
Steve and Judy’s load—even if it was only for a few days.

The Bible says to “honor your father and mother” (Eph. 6:2). One New
Testament commentary says that to honor someone is to “treat him with
the deference, respect, reverence, kindness, courtesy, and obedience
which his station in life . . . demands.”

For young children, this means obeying parents. For teenagers, it
indicates showing respect for Mom and Dad even if you think you know
more than they do. For young adults, this means including your parents
in your life. And for those in middle-age and beyond, it means making
sure that parents are cared for as they move into old age or their
health declines.

How can you honor your parents this week?
