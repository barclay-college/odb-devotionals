Come to Me

I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger. —
John 6:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 6:30-40

When Jesus lived on this earth, He invited people to come to Him, and
He still does today (John 6:35). But what do He and His Father in
heaven have that we need?

Salvation. Jesus is the only way to have forgiveness of sin and the
promise of heaven. “Whoever believes in Him should not perish but have
eternal life” (John 3:15).

Purpose. We are to give all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength to
following Jesus. “Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me” (Mark 8:34).

Comfort. In trial or sorrow, the “God of all comfort . . . comforts us
in all our tribulation” (2 Cor. 1:3-4).

Wisdom. We need wisdom beyond our own for making decisions. “If any of
you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, . . . and it will be given to
him” (James 1:5).

Strength. When we’re weary, “the Lord will give strength to His
people” (Ps. 29:11).

Abundant life. The fullest life is found in a relationship with Jesus.
“I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more
abundantly” (John 10:10).

Jesus said, “The one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out”
(John 6:37). Come!
