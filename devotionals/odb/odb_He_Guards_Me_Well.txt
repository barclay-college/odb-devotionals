He Guards Me Well

I lay down My life for the sheep. —
John 10:15

Today's Scripture: John 10:7-15

During the quiet moments before a Sunday morning service, the organist
played a hymn that was new to me. I turned to the page noted in the
hymnal and read the words of the song “The Lord My Shepherd Guards Me
Well,” a beautiful paraphrase of Psalm 23:

The Lord my Shepherd guards me well, And all my wants are fed: Amid
green pastures made to lie, Beside still waters led. My care-worn soul
grows strong and whole When God’s true path I tread.

No matter how often we read or hear the familiar 23rd Psalm, it seems
to come with a fresh message of God’s care for us.

Though I should walk in darkest ways Through valleys like the grave,
No evil shall I ever fear; Your presence makes me brave. On my behalf
Your rod and staff Assure me You will save. (© Hope Publishing Co.)

This image was familiar to the people who heard Jesus say, “I am the
good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep” (John
10:11). Unlike a hired person who runs away from danger, the true
shepherd stays with the sheep to protect them. “But a hireling, he who
is not the shepherd . . . sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep
and flees . . . . I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep”
(vv.12-14).

No matter what you’re facing today, Jesus knows your name, He knows
the danger, and He will not leave your side. You can say with
confidence: The Lord my Shepherd guards me well!
