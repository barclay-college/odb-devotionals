Tossing and Turning

In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, make me dwell
in safety.
Psalm 4:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 4

What keeps you awake at night? Lately I’ve been losing sleep, tossing
and turning on my bed, trying to work out a solution to an issue.
Eventually I begin fretting about not getting enough rest to handle
the challenges of the next day!

Sound familiar? Troubled relationships, an uncertain future, whatever
it is—we all give in to worry at one point or another.

King David was clearly in distress when he penned Psalm 4. People were
ruining his reputation with groundless accusations (v. 2). And some
were questioning his competency to rule (v. 6). David probably felt
angry for being treated so unfairly. Surely he could have spent nights
stewing about it. Yet we read these remarkable words: “In peace I will
lie down and sleep” (v. 8).

Charles Spurgeon explains verse 8 beautifully: “In thus lying down, .
. . [David] resigned himself into the hands of another; he did so
completely, for in the absence of all care, he slept; there was here a
perfect trust.” What inspired this trust? From the start, David was
confident that God would answer his prayers (v. 3). And he was sure
that since God had chosen to love him, He would lovingly meet his
needs.

May God help us to rest in His power and presence when worries
threaten. In His sovereign and loving arms, we can “lie down and
sleep.”

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, thank You for hearing me when I call. I surrender my
worries to You and rest in Your power and presence.

We can entrust our cares to a wholly trustworthy God.
