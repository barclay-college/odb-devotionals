Unchanging Love

The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God
lives forever.
1 John 2:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 103:13–22

When I was in high school I played on the varsity tennis team. I spent
many hours of my teenage years trying to improve my skills on four
concrete courts located just two blocks from my home.

The last time I visited that city, one of the first things I did was
drive to the tennis courts, hoping to watch others play and reminisce
for a moment. But the old courts, so familiar to my memory, were
nowhere to be seen. In their place was a vacant field, inhabited only
by an occasional weed waving silently in the breeze.

That afternoon remains in my mind as a stark reminder of the brevity
of life. One of the places where I expended some of my best youthful
strength no longer existed! Reflecting on that experience later
brought me to this truth, expressed by an aging King David: “The life
of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field;
the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no
more. But from everlasting to everlasting the Lord ’s love is with
those who fear him” (Psalm 103:15–17).

We grow older and the world around us may change, but God’s love
doesn’t. He can always be trusted to take care of those who turn to
Him.
