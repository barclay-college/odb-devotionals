Like A Flock

You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. —
Psalm 77:20

Today's Scripture: Psalm 77:11-20

During a demonstration of sheep- herding using a Border Collie, the
dog trainer explained that because sheep are highly vulnerable to wild
animals, their main defense against predators is to stay together in a
tightly knit group. “A sheep alone is a dead sheep,” the trainer said.
“The dog always keeps the sheep together as it moves them.”

The biblical image of God as our shepherd is a powerful reminder of
how much we need each other in the community of faith. When writing
about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the psalmist said,
“[God] made His own people go forth like sheep, and guided them in the
wilderness like a flock; and He led them on safely, so that they did
not fear” (Ps. 78:52-53).

As part of God’s flock, we who have trusted Christ are under His
guiding, protecting hand while being surrounded by the shielding
presence of others. We are part of a larger body of believers in which
there is safety and accountability.

While we don’t give up our personal responsibility for thought and
action as members of the flock, we are to embrace the concept of “we”
rather than “me” in our daily lives. With Christ as our Shepherd and
fellow believers around us, we find safety in the flock.

Blest be the tie that binds Our hearts in Christian love! The
fellowship of kindred minds Is like to that above. —Fawcett

As part of God’s flock, we’re protected by Him and by each other.
