What Shall I Give You?

God said, “Ask! What shall I give you?” —
1 Kings 3:5

Today's Scripture: 1 Kings 3:1-9

I’ve been told that “three-wish stories” occur in almost every
culture, all following a similar theme: A benefactor appears and
offers to grant three wishes to an unsuspecting beneficiary. The fact
that the stories so often occur suggests we all want something we
cannot get on our own.

There’s even a “wish story” in the Bible. It happened one night when
the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and said to him, “Ask! What
shall I give you?” (1 Kings 3:5). Solomon could have asked for
anything—riches, honor, fame, or power. But he asked for none of these
things. He requested “an understanding heart” (v.9), or a “hearing
heart,” a humble heart to listen and learn from God’s Word. The young,
inexperienced king, weighed down with the responsibilities of ruling a
vast nation, needed the Lord’s wisdom to govern well.

Am I that wise? If God spoke to me directly and asked what He could do
for me, what would I ask for? Would I ask for health, wealth, youth,
power, or prestige? Or would I ask for wisdom, holiness, and love?
Would I be wise or foolish?

Suppose God asked you what He could give to you. What would you ask
for?

Reflect & Pray

True wisdom is in leaning On Jesus Christ, our Lord; True wisdom is in
trusting His own life-giving Word. —Anon.

God’s wisdom is given to those who humbly ask Him for it.
