Alternatives To Revenge

You shall not take vengeance . . . , but you shall love your neighbor
as yourself. —
Leviticus 19:18

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 19:16-21 Matthew 5:38-45

One Sunday while preaching, a pastor was accosted and punched by a
man. He continued preaching, and the man was arrested. The pastor
prayed for him and even visited him in jail a few days later. What an
example of the way to respond to insult and injury!

While there is a place for self-defense, personal revenge was
forbidden in the Old Testament: “You shall not take vengeance, nor
bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall
love your neighbor as yourself” (Lev. 19:18; see also Deut. 32:35). It
was also forbidden by Jesus and the apostles (Matt. 5:38-45; Rom.
12:17; 1 Peter 3:9).

The Old Testament law exacted like for like (Ex. 21:23-25; Deut.
19:21), which ensured that judicial punishment was not unjust or
malicious. But there was a larger principle looming when it came to
personal revenge: Justice must be done, but it must be left in the
hands of God or the authorities ordained by God.

Instead of returning injury and insult, may we live by Christ-honoring
and Spirit-empowered alternatives: Live at peace with everyone (Rom.
12:18), submit to a spiritual mediator (1 Cor. 6:1-6), and leave it in
the hands of authorities and, most of all, in God’s hands.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, when I’m troubled by the insult of another, help me to let go of
my desire for revenge. May I seek justice but also realize that it
will happen in Your time. I want to learn to overcome evil with good.
Amen.

Leave final justice in the hands of a just God.
