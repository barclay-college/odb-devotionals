Watchful Care

“Do not I fill heaven and earth?” declares the Lord.
Jeremiah 23:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 23:20–24

Before he raced out the door to school, I asked my son if he had
brushed his teeth. Asking again, I reminded him of the importance of
telling the truth. Unmoved by my gentle admonishment, he half-jokingly
informed me that what I really needed was a security camera in the
bathroom. Then I could check for myself if he had brushed his teeth
and he wouldn’t be tempted to lie.

While the presence of a security camera may help remind us to follow
the rules, there are still places we can go unnoticed or ways we can
avoid being seen. Although we may evade or trick a security camera, we
fool ourselves if we think we are ever outside the gaze of God.

God asks, “Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them?”
(Jeremiah 23:24). There is both an encouragement and a warning in His
question.

The warning is that we cannot hide from God. We can’t outrun or fool
Him. Everything we do is visible to Him.

The encouragement is that there is no place on earth or in the heavens
where we are outside the watchful care of our heavenly Father. Even
when we feel alone, God is with us. No matter where we go today, may
the awareness of that truth encourage us to choose obedience to His
Word and receive comfort—He watches over us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, thank You that there is nowhere I can go that is outside
of Your loving gaze. Knowing You see me, help me to honor You with my
words and actions.

We are never outside the watchful care of our heavenly Father.
