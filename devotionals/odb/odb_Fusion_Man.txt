Fusion Man

So I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be
at rest.” —
Psalm 55:6

Today's Scripture: Psalm 55:1-8

Yves Rossy accomplished something people have dreamed of since the
ancient myth of Icarus. He has flown. Known as the “Fusion Man,” Rossy
built a set of wings with an engine pack that uses his body as the
fuselage of the aircraft, with the wings fused to the back of his
heat-resistant suit. His first flight took place near Geneva,
Switzerland, in 2004, and he has since had numerous successful
flights.

The psalmist David longed to have wings so he could fly away. In a
time when he was being pursued by enemies who were seeking to take his
life, Israel’s king cried, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would
fly away and be at rest” (Ps. 55:6).

Like David, when we’re facing pressure, mistreatment, hardship, or
grief, we might wish we could sprout wings and fly away. But Jesus
offers a better way. Rather than fleeing our struggles, He invites us
to flee to Him. He said, “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from
Me, . . . and you will find rest for your souls” (Matt. 11:28-29).
Rather than wishing we could fly away and escape life’s problems, we
can bring them to Him.

Escape cannot give us rest, but Jesus can.

Reflect & Pray

O give me a spirit of peace, dear Lord, Midst the storms and tempests
that roll, That I may find rest and quiet within, A calm buried deep
in my soul. —Dawe

God gives us strength to face our problems, not to flee from them.
