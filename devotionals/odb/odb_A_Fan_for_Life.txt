A Fan for Life

I call to you, because you answer me.
Psalm 86:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 86:1–13

Cade Pope, a 12-year-old boy from Oklahoma, mailed out 32 handwritten
letters—one to each executive in charge of a National Football League
(NFL) team in the US. Cade wrote, “My family and I love football. We
play fantasy football and watch [the] games every weekend. . . . I am
ready to pick an NFL team to cheer on for a lifetime!”

Jerry Richardson, owner of the Carolina Panthers football team,
responded with a handwritten note of his own. The first line read: “We
would be honored if our [team] became your team. We would make you
proud.” Richardson went on to commend some of his players. His letter
was not only personal and kindhearted—it was the only response that
Cade received. Not surprisingly, Cade became a loyal fan of the
Carolina Panthers.

In Psalm 86, David spoke about his allegiance to the one true God. He
said, “When I am in distress, I call to you, because you answer me.
Among the gods there is none like you, Lord” (vv. 7–8). Our devotion
to God is born from His character and His care for us. He is the one
who answers our prayers, guides us by His Spirit, and saves us through
the death and resurrection of His Son, Jesus Christ. He deserves our
lifelong loyalty.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, there is no one like You. Help me to consider Your
holiness and let it lead me into deeper devotion to You.

Only God is worthy of our adoration and devotion.
