Ringing Reminders

Though he may stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with
his hand.
Psalm 37:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 37:21-31

The clock tower at Westminster, which contains the bell known as Big
Ben, is an iconic landmark in London, England. It is traditionally
thought that the melody of the tower chimes was taken from the tune of
“I Know That My Redeemer Liveth” from Handel’s Messiah. Words were
eventually added and put on display in the clock room:

Lord, through this hour be Thou our guide;

So by Thy power no foot shall slide.

These words allude to Psalm 37: “The Lord directs the steps of the
godly. He delights in every detail of their lives. Though they
stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand”
(vv. 23-24 nlt). Notice how intimately involved God is in His
children’s experience: “He delights in every detail of their lives”
(v. 23 nlt). Verse 31 adds, “The law of their God is in their hearts;
their feet do not slip.”

How extraordinary! The Creator of the universe not only upholds us and
helps us but He also cares deeply about every moment we live. No
wonder the apostle Peter was able to confidently invite us to “cast
all your anxiety on him because he cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7). As
the assurance of His care rings in our hearts, we find courage to face
whatever comes our way.
