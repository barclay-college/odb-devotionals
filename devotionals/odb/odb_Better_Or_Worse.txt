Better Or Worse?

You must continue in the things which you have learned and been
assured of. —
2 Timothy 3:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Timothy 3:1-5,10-17

At the beginning of each new year, experts give their predictions
about the economy, politics, weather, and a host of other topics. Will
there be war or peace? Poverty or prosperity? Progress or stagnation?
People everywhere are hoping that this year will be better than last,
but no one knows what will happen.

There is, however, something we can be certain about. A guest speaker
at my church suggested that when we ask if the world will get better
or worse, the answer is “Yes, to both!”

Paul told Timothy, “In the last days perilous times will come; . . .
evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being
deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned
and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them” (2 Tim.
3:1,13-14).

The inspired Word of God instructs, corrects, and encourages us as we
follow God’s path (vv.16-17). J. B. Phillips described the Scriptures
as our “comprehensive equipment” that prepares us fully for all
branches of God’s work.

As the spiritual darkness of our world grows deeper, the light of
Christ shines more brightly through all those who know and love Him.
Jesus is our joy and hope—today, tomorrow, and forever!

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, the trouble in this world can divert our eyes from
You. Thank You for Your Word that helps us stay focused. May we find
our delight in Your love and share it with others today.

The powers of evil around you are no match for the power of Jesus
within you.
