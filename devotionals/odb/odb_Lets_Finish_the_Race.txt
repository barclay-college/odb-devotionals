Let’s Finish the Race

Two are better than one . . . . If either of them falls down, one can
help the other up.
Ecclesiastes 4:9–10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 4:9–12

In the 2016 Rio Olympics, two athletes in the 5,000-meter race caught
the world’s attention. About 3,200 meters into the race, New Zealander
Nikki Hamblin and American Abbey D’Agostino collided and fell. Abbey
was quickly up on her feet, but stopped to help Nikki. Moments after
the two athletes had started running again, Abbey began faltering, her
right leg injured as a result of the fall. It was now Nikki’s turn to
stop and encourage her fellow athlete to finish the race. When Abbey
eventually stumbled across the finish line, Nikki was waiting to
embrace her. What a beautiful picture of mutual encouragement!

It reminds me of a passage in the Bible: “Two are better than one . .
. . If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity
anyone who falls and has no one to help them up” (Eccl. 4:9–10). As
runners in a spiritual race, we need one another—perhaps even more so,
for we are not racing in competition with each other but as members of
the same team. There’ll be moments where we falter and need someone to
pick us up; at other times, someone may need our encouragement through
our prayers or presence.

The spiritual race is not to be run alone. Is God leading you to be a
Nikki or Abbey in someone’s life? Respond to His prompting today, and
let’s finish the race!

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for the encouragement of fellow believers to help
me on my journey. Help me to look for ways to encourage others.

We need each other to get where God wants us to go.
