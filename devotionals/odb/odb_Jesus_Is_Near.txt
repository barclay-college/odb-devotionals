Jesus Is Near

Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it. —
Genesis 28:16

Today's Scripture: Genesis 28:10-22

Samuel, who was 4, had finished eating his dinner and asked if he
could be dismissed from the table. He wanted to go outside to play.
But he was too young to be out alone, so his mother said, “No. You
can’t go outside by yourself. You need to wait for me to finish and go
with you.” His quick reply: “But, Mommy, Jesus is with me!”

Samuel had learned well from his parents that the Lord is always by
his side. We see in our Bible reading today that Jacob had learned
that lesson too. His father Isaac had blessed him and told him to find
a wife from among his mother’s family (Gen. 28:1-4). He followed that
directive and traveled toward Haran.

As Jacob slept, the Lord came to him in a dream and said, “I am with
you and will keep you wherever you go . . . ; for I will not leave
you” (v.15). When he awoke, he knew that he had heard from God, and
said, “Surely the Lord is in this place” (v.16). Confident of God’s
presence, he committed himself to following Him with his life
(vv.20-21).

If we have received Jesus as our Savior (John 1:12), we can be
confident and take comfort in the truth that He is always present with
us (Heb. 13:5). Like Jacob, may our response to His love be
wholehearted devotion.
