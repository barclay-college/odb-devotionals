Can’t Die But Once

Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.
Matthew 10:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 10:26–32

Born into slavery and badly treated as a young girl, Harriet Tubman
(c. 1822–1913) found a shining ray of hope in the Bible stories her
mother told. The account of Israel’s escape from slavery under Pharaoh
showed her a God who desired freedom for His people.

Harriet found freedom when she slipped over the Maryland state line
and out of slavery. She couldn’t remain content, however, knowing so
many were still trapped in captivity. So she led more than a dozen
rescue missions to free those still in slavery, dismissing the
personal danger. “I can’t die but once,” she said.

Harriet knew the truth of the statement: “Do not be afraid of those
who kill the body but cannot kill the soul” (Matt. 10:28). Jesus spoke
those words as He sent His disciples on their first mission. He knew
they would face danger, and not everyone would receive them warmly. So
why expose the disciples to the risk? The answer is found in the
previous chapter. “When he saw the crowds, [Jesus] had compassion on
them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a
shepherd” (9:36).

When Harriet Tubman couldn’t forget those still trapped in slavery,
she showed us a picture of Christ, who did not forget us when we were
trapped in our sins. Her courageous example inspires us to remember
those who remain without hope in the world.
