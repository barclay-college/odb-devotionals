Giving in to Jesus

In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in
Christ Jesus.
Romans 6:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 4:6–10

They call it “The Devil’s Footprint.” It’s a foot-shaped impression in
the granite on a hill beside a church in Ipswich, Massachusetts.
According to local legend the “footprint” happened one fall day in
1740, when the evangelist George Whitefield preached so powerfully
that the devil leaped from the church steeple, landing on the rock on
his way out of town.

Though it’s only a legend, the story calls to mind an encouraging
truth from God’s Word. James 4:7 reminds us, “Submit yourselves, then,
to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”

God has given us the strength we need to stand against our adversary
and the temptations in our lives. The Bible tells us that “sin shall
no longer be your master” (Rom. 6:14) because of God’s loving grace to
us through Jesus Christ. As we run to Jesus when temptation comes, He
enables us to stand in His strength. Nothing we face in this life can
overcome Him, because He has “overcome the world” (John 16:33).

As we submit ourselves to our Savior, yielding our wills to Him in the
moment and walking in obedience to God’s Word, He is helping us. When
we give in to Him instead of giving in to temptation, He is able to
fight our battles. In Him we can overcome.
