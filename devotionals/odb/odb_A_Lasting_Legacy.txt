A Lasting Legacy

[Eve] said, “With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.”
Genesis 4:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 4:1–2

Thomas Edison invented the first practical electric light bulb. Jonas
Salk developed an effective polio vaccine. Amy Carmichael penned many
of the hymns we sing in worship. But what about you? Why were you put
on earth? How will you invest your life?

Genesis 4 tells us that Eve “became pregnant and gave birth to Cain.”
After holding Cain for the first time, Eve announced, “With the help
of the Lord I have brought forth a man” (v. 1). In an effort to
explain the surprising experience of the very first birth, Eve uses a
phrase dripping with dependency on the sovereign aid of God: “With the
help of the Lord .” Eventually, through Eve’s seed, God would provide
rescue for His people through another Son (John 3:16). What a legacy!

Parenthood is just one of many ways people make lasting contributions
to this world. Perhaps your offering will burst forth from a room
where you write or knit or paint. You might be an example for another
who is deprived of godly influence. Or your investment might even come
after your death in ways you could never imagine. It may be the work
you leave behind or your reputation for integrity in business. In any
case, will your words echo Eve’s dependency on God? With the help of
the Lord, what will you do for His honor?

Reflect & Pray

How do you want to be remembered after you leave this world? In what
ways will you seek God’s help to make that happen?

Dear God, may I lean into You in all I do, because it is only
with Your help that I can bring forth a lasting legacy.
