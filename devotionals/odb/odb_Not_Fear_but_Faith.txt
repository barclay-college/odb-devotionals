Not Fear but Faith

The Lord is with us. Do not be afraid of them.
Numbers 14:9

Today's Scripture: Numbers 13:25–14:9

“My husband was offered a promotion in another country, but I feared
leaving our home, so he reluctantly declined the offer,” my friend
shared with me. She explained how apprehension over such a big change
kept her from embracing a new adventure, and that she sometimes
wondered what they missed in not moving.

The Israelites let their anxieties paralyze them when they were called
to inhabit a rich and fertile land that flowed “with milk and honey”
(Ex. 33:3). When they heard the reports of the powerful people in
large cities (Num. 13:28), they started to fear. The majority of the
Israelites rejected the call to enter the land.

But Joshua and Caleb urged them to trust in the Lord, saying, “Do not
be afraid of the people in the land” for the “ Lord is with us”
(14:9). Although the people there appeared large, they could trust the
Lord to be with them.

My friend wasn’t commanded to move to another country like the
Israelites were, yet she regretted letting fear close off the
opportunity. What about you—do you face a fearful situation? If so,
know that the Lord is with you and will guide you. With His never-
failing love, we can move forward in faith.

Reflect & Pray

Loving Father, may I not let my fear stop me from following You, for I
know that You will always love me and will never leave me.

Fear can paralyze but faith propels us to follow God.
