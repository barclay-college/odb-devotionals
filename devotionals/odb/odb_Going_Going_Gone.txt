Going, Going, Gone

Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone.
Proverbs 23:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 23:1–5

The mischievous artist Banksy pulled off another practical joke. His
painting Girl with Balloon sold for one million pounds at Sotheby’s
auction house in London. Moments after the auctioneer yelled “Sold,”
an alarm sounded and the painting slipped halfway through a shredder
mounted inside the bottom of the frame. Banksy tweeted a picture of
bidders gasping at his ruined masterpiece, with the caption, “Going,
going, gone.”

Banksy relished pulling one over on the wealthy, but he need not have
bothered. Wealth itself has plenty of pranks up its sleeve. God says,
“Do not wear yourself out to get rich . . . . Cast but a glance at
riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly
off to the sky like an eagle” (Proverbs 23:4–5).

Few things are less secure than money. We work hard to earn it, yet
there are many ways to lose it. Investments go sour, inflation erodes,
bills come, thieves steal, and fire and flood destroy. Even if we
manage to keep our money, the time we have to spend it continually
flies. Blink, and your life is going, going, gone.

What to do? God tells us a few verses later: “always be zealous for
the fear of the Lord . There is surely a future hope for you, and your
hope will not be cut off” (vv. 17–18). Invest your life in Jesus; He
alone will keep you forever.
