Run to Me

The name of the Lord is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and
are safe.
Proverbs 18:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 18:4–12

During a walk at a local park, my children and I encountered a couple
of unleashed dogs. Their owner didn’t seem to notice that one of them
had begun to intimidate my son. My son tried to shoo the dog away, but
the animal only became more intent on bothering him.

Eventually, my son panicked. He bolted several yards into the
distance, but the dog pursued him. The chase continued until I yelled,
“Run to me!” My son doubled back, calmed down, and the dog finally
decided to make mischief somewhere else.

There are moments in our lives when God calls to us and says, “Run to
Me!” Something troubling is on our heels. The faster and farther we
go, the more closely it pursues us. We can’t shake it. We’re too
afraid to turn and confront the trouble on our own. But the reality is
that we aren’t on our own. God is there, ready to help and comfort us.
All we have to do is turn away from whatever scares us, and move in
His direction. His Word says, “The name of the Lord is a fortified
tower; the righteous run to it and are safe” (Prov. 18:10).
