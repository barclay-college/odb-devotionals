The Joy Of Disappointment

Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own
understanding. —
Proverbs 3:5

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 3:1-12

While in Bible college, I auditioned for one of the school’s traveling
musical teams. I was excited about the thought of being able to be
involved in that ministry, but was crushed when I failed to make the
team. In my disappointment, I could only trust that God’s purposes
were greater than mine.

Months later, I had the opportunity to join a different musical team,
but as the Bible teacher. The results were more than I could have
imagined. Not only was my future wife a part of that team, allowing us
to serve Christ together, but it also gave me many opportunities to
preach over the next 3 years—priceless preparation for a life of
ministry in the Word.

Many times we struggle with the reality that our Father knows what is
best. We assume our way is right. But, as we rest in Him, His purposes
always prove to be for our good and His praise. To be honest, that’s
easy to see when the outcome is better than we had hoped, but
difficult when we can’t see the good right now or maybe won’t till
heaven.

As wise King Solomon said, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and
lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him,
and He shall direct your paths” (Prov. 3:5-6).
