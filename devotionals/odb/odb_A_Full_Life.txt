A Full Life

Of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. —
John 1:16

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 8:7-18

During the celebration of the Chinese New Year, it is customary to use
certain words in print and conversation. One word is often used by
itself. It is the word full, meaning “abundance of” and is used to
wish someone material prosperity for the year ahead.

Moses told the Israelites about the wealth and prosperity in the land
of Canaan before they entered it (Deut. 8:7-9). They would have
everything they needed and more. But he warned them of the danger of
forgetting that God, the One who had brought them out of Egypt and
protected them along the way, had given them that abundance (v.11).
Thus Moses commanded them, “You shall remember the Lord your God, for
it is He who gives you power to get wealth” (v.18).

“Wealth,” of course, is not just material things. Everything you have
is from God. Our Lord Jesus told His disciples, “I have come that
[you] may have life, and that [you] may have it more abundantly” (John
10:10).

We too may be tempted to forget that it’s the Lord who has blessed us
and has met our needs. Our lives will be full, abundant, and
satisfying only when we are connected to Jesus Christ.

You only are true Life, To know You is to live The more abundant life
That earth can never give. —Clarkson

Never let the abundance of God’s gifts cause you to forget the Giver.
