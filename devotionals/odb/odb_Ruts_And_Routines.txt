Ruts And Routines

Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, for in You do I
trust. —
Psalm 143:8

Today's Scripture: Daniel 6:1-10

Summer is my favorite season. I love the leisurely days when I can set
aside some of my routines without feeling guilty. Doing new things,
seeing new places, and allowing myself the time to take “the scenic
route” revive my spirit and renew my enthusiasm for life and work.

But summer can also be a dangerous time of breaking good habits.
Certain routines are good. They increase our efficiency and ensure
that important things get done. After all, we need to have fixed times
and places for certain things or the world would be chaotic. Creation
is designed to operate on schedule, and, as part of it, so are we. We
need food and sleep at regular intervals.

We sometimes hear legitimate warnings about allowing routines to turn
into ruts. But the Bible indicates that having set times for certain
things is good. David indicated that morning was the right time for
him to praise God and ask for His direction (Ps. 5:3; 143:8). And
Daniel prayed three times a day, and not even the threat of death made
him change his routine (Dan. 6:10).

While enjoying carefree days, we must not become careless about
spending time with God. Savoring spiritual sustenance is a routine for
all seasons.
