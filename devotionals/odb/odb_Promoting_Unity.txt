Promoting Unity

The Lord hates . . . one who sows discord among brethren. —
Proverbs 6:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 6:16-19

The language of Proverbs 6:16-19 is strong. In the citing of seven
things the Lord hates, sowing “discord among brethren” makes the list.
The reason for naming this sin is that it spoils the unity that Christ
desires for His followers (John 17:21-22).

Those who sow discord may not initially set out to create divisions.
They may be preoccupied instead with their personal needs or the
interests of a group they belong to (James 4:1-10). Consider how Lot’s
herdsmen argued with those of Abraham (Gen. 13:1-18); Christ’s
disciples argued about personal preeminence (Luke 9:46); and divisive
groups in the church at Corinth elevated party factions above the
unity of the Spirit (1 Cor. 3:1-7).

So what is the best way to promote unity? It begins with the
transformation of the heart. When we adopt the mind of Christ, we
develop an attitude of humility and we focus on service toward others
(Phil. 2:5-11). Only in Him can we access the power to “look out not
only for [our] own interests, but also for the interests of others”
(v.4). Soon the needs and hopes of others become more important to us
than our own.

With growing bonds of love among us, we find discord replaced with joy
and unity (see Ps. 133:1).
