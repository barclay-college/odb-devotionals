Desert Solitaire

And God saw that it was good.
Genesis 1:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 136:1–9

Desert Solitaire is Edward Abbey’s personal history of his summers as
a park ranger in what is now called Arches National Park in Utah. The
book is worth reading if only for Abbey’s bright language and vivid
descriptions of the US Southwest.

But Abbey, for all his artistry, was an atheist who could see nothing
beyond the surface of the beauty he enjoyed. How sad! He lived
his entire life in praise of beauty and missed the point of it all.

Most ancient peoples had theories of origins enshrouded in legend,
myth, and song. But Israel’s story of creation was unique: It told of
a God who created beauty for our enjoyment and childlike delight. God
thought up the cosmos, spoke it into being and pronounced it
“beautiful.” (The Hebrew word for good also signifies beauty.) Then,
having created a paradise, God in love spoke us into being, placed us
in Eden, and told us, “Enjoy!”

Some see and enjoy the beauty of the Creator’s good gifts all around
them, but don’t “worship him as God or even give him thanks.” They
“think up foolish ideas of what God [is] like. As a result, their
minds become dark and confused”  (Rom. 1:21 nlt).

Others see beauty, say “Thank You, God,” and step into His light.

Reflect & Pray

Loving Father, we praise You because You are good. Thank You for
infusing Your creation with beauty and purpose and for placing us here
to enjoy it as we discover You. Your love endures forever!

All of creation reflects the beauty of God.
