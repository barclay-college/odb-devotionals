Never Let Down

[The Lord’s] compassions fail not. They are new every morning. —
Lamentations 3:22-23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Lamentations 3:13-26

When I was a child, one of my favorite pastimes was playing on the
teeter-totter in the nearby park. A kid would sit on each end of the
board and bounce each other up and down. Sometimes the one who was
down would stay there and leave his playmate stuck up in the air
yelling to be let down. But the cruelest of all tricks was getting off
the teeter-totter and running away when your friend was up in the
air—he would come crashing down to the ground with a painful bump.

Sometimes we may feel that Jesus does that to us. We trust Him to be
there with us through the ups and downs of life. However, when life
takes a turn and leaves us with bumps and bruises, it may feel as if
He has walked away leaving our lives to come painfully crashing down.

But Lamentations 3 reminds us that “the steadfast love of the Lord
never ceases; his mercies never come to an end” (v.22 esv) and that
God is faithful to the end even when everything seems to be falling
apart. This means that in the midst of our pain, even though we may be
lonely, we are not alone. And though we may not feel His presence, He
is there as our trusted companion who will never walk away and let us
down!

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, that we can trust in Your faithful presence even when
we feel alone. Help us to wait patiently for You to manifest Your
steadfast loving presence.

When everyone else fails, Jesus is your most trusted friend.
