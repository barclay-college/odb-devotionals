The Lesson

Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. —
Romans 12:21

Today's Scripture: Romans 12:14-21

One summer I was at a gathering of old high school acquaintances when
someone behind me tapped me on my shoulder. As my eyes drifted over
the woman’s name tag, my mind drifted back in time. I remembered a
tightly folded note that had been shoved through the slot on my
locker. It had contained cruel words of rejection that had shamed me
and crushed my spirit. I remember thinking, Somebody needs to teach
you a lesson on how to treat people! Although I felt as if I were
reliving my adolescent pain, I mustered up my best fake smile; and
insincere words began coming out of my mouth.

We began to converse. A sad story of a difficult upbringing and of an
unhappy marriage began to pour out of her. As it did, the words “root
of bitterness” from Hebrews 12:15 popped into my head. That’s what I’m
feeling, I thought. After all these years, I still had a deep root of
bitterness hidden within me, twisting around and strangling my heart.

Then these words came to my mind: “Do not be overcome by evil, but
overcome evil with good” (Rom. 12:21).

We talked. We even shared some tears. Neither of us mentioned the
long-ago incident. God taught someone a lesson that afternoon—a lesson
of forgiveness and of letting go of bitterness. He taught it to me.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, please help me not to harbor resentment and bitterness in
my heart. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, enable me to let go of
my bitterness and forgive those who have hurt me.

Revenge imprisons us; forgiveness sets us free.
