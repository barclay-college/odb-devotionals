One Who Serves

Yet I am among you as the One who serves. —
Luke 22:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 22:24-27

“I’m nobody’s servant!” I cried out. That morning the demands of my
family seemed too much as I frantically helped to find my husband’s
blue tie, while feeding the crying baby and recovering the lost toy
from under the bed for our 2-year-old.

Later on that day, as I was reading the Bible, I came across this
verse: “For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who
serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the
One who serves” (Luke 22:27).

Jesus didn’t have to wash His disciples’ feet, yet He did (John 13:5).
There were servants who did that job, but Jesus chose to serve them.
Today’s society insists that we should aim to “be somebody.” We want
the best-paying job, the highest position in the company, the top
leadership in church. Yet whatever position we are in, we can learn
from our Savior to serve.

We hold different roles as parents, children, friends, workers,
leaders, or students. The question is this: Do we carry out those
roles with an attitude of service? Even though my everyday routine is
sometimes tiring, I’m thankful the Master will help me because I do
want to follow His steps and willingly serve others.

May God help us to do this each day.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, I know that You did not come to be served, but to serve.
Sometimes I fail to think of others, but I want to be like You. Please
give me a heart like Yours.

We need a servant’s attitude to be like Jesus.
