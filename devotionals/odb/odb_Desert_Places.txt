Desert Places

They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts. —
Isaiah 48:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 48:16-22

Dry. Dusty. Dangerous. A desert. A place where there is little water,
a place hostile to life. It’s not surprising, then, that the word
deserted describes a place that is uninhabited. Life there is hard.
Few people choose it. But sometimes we can’t avoid it.

In Scripture, God’s people were familiar with desert life. Much of the
Middle East, including Israel, is desert. But there are lush
exceptions, like the Jordan Valley and areas surrounding the Sea of
Galilee. God chose to “raise His family” in a place surrounded by
wilderness, a place where He could make His goodness known to His
children as they trusted Him for protection and daily provision (Isa.
48:17-19).

Today, most of us don’t live in literal deserts, but we often go
through desert-like places. Sometimes we go as an act of obedience.
Other times we find ourselves there through no conscious choice or
action. When someone abandons us, or disease invades our bodies, we
end up in desert-like circumstances where resources are scarce and
life is hard to sustain.

But the point of going through a desert, whether literally or
figuratively, is to remind us that we are dependent on God to sustain
us—a lesson we need to remember even when we’re living in a place of
plenty.

Reflect & Pray

Are you living in a place of plenty or of need? In what ways is God
sustaining you?

In every desert, God has an oasis of grace.
