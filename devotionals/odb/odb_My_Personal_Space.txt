My Personal Space

We do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our
weaknesses.
Hebrews 4:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 8:40-48

An industrial design graduate from a Singapore university was
challenged in a workshop to come up with a novel solution to a common
problem using only ordinary objects. She created a vest to protect
one’s personal space from being invaded while traveling in the crush
of crowded public trains and buses. The vest was covered with long,
flexible plastic spikes normally used to keep birds and cats away from
plants.

Jesus knew what it was like to lose His personal space in the
commotion of crowds desperate to see and touch Him. A woman who had
suffered from constant bleeding for 12 years and could find no cure
touched the fringe of His robe. Immediately, her bleeding stopped
(Luke 8:43-44).

Jesus’ question, “Who touched me?” (v. 45) isn’t as strange as it
sounds. He felt power come out of Him (v. 46). That touch was
different from those who merely happened to accidentally touch Him.

While we must admit that we do sometimes wish to keep our personal
space and privacy, the only way we help a world of hurting people is
to let them get close enough to be touched by the encouragement,
comfort, and grace of Christ in us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, I want to be near You and know You so that when I’m in
contact with others they can see You through me.

A Christian’s life is the window through which others can see Jesus.
