Divine Diversions

And he called His name Jesus. —
Matthew 1:25

Today's Scripture: Matthew 1:18-25

I tend to get stuck in my ways, so anything that diverts me from my
routines and plans can be very annoying. Worse yet, life’s diversions
are sometimes unsettling and painful. But God, who said, “My thoughts
are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways” (Isa. 55:8), knows
that He often needs to divert us in order to make more of our lives
than we would have if we had stuck to our original plans.

Think of Joseph. God diverted him to Egypt to prepare him to rescue
God’s chosen people from starvation. Or of Moses, who was diverted
from the luxurious lifestyle of Pharaoh’s house to meet God in the
wilderness in preparation to lead God’s people toward the Promised
Land. Or of Joseph and Mary to whom the angel announced the most
significant diversion of all. Mary would be with child, and this child
would be called “Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins”
(Matt. 1:21). Joseph believed in the bigger purpose that God had for
him, surrendered to the diversion, and obediently “called His name
Jesus” (v.25). The rest is wonderful history!

We can trust God’s greater plans as He does His far better work in the
history of our lives.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, teach us to be willing to adjust our plans to conform to Yours.
You have greater things in store for us than we could ever dream, so
help us to patiently wait for You to work in the circumstances of our
lives.

Let God direct—or redirect—your steps.
