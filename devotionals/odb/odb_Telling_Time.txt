Telling Time

[Make] the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
Ephesians 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 90:9–17

“Westerners have watches. Africans have time.” So said Os Guinness,
quoting an African proverb in his book Impossible People. That caused
me to ponder the times I have responded to a request with, “I don’t
have time.” I thought about the tyranny of the urgent and how
schedules and deadlines dominate my life.

Moses prayed in Psalm 90, “Teach us to number our days, that we may
gain a heart of wisdom” (v. 12). And Paul wrote, “Be very careful,
then, how you live . . . making the most of every opportunity, because
the days are evil” (Ephesians 5:15–16).

I suspect that Paul and Moses would agree that our wise use of time
isn’t just a matter of clock-watching. The situation may call for us
to keep a tight schedule—or it may compel us to give someone an
extended gift of our time.

We have but a brief moment to make a difference for Christ in our
world, and we need to maximize that opportunity. That may mean
ignoring our watches and planners for a while as we show Christ’s
patient love to those He brings into our lives.

As we live in the strength and grace of the timeless Christ, we impact
our time for eternity.

Reflect & Pray

Father, You have given us all the time we need to accomplish what You
have given us to do. May we use our time in ways that honor You. For
more, read Mary and Martha: Balancing Life’s Priorities.

Time management is not about clock-watching, it’s about making the
most of the time we have.
