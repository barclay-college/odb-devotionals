United Goal

I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among
you. —
1 Corinthians 1:10

Today's Scripture: 1 Cor. 1:10-17

The spotted owl has been disappearing in the US. Originally it was
believed that old growth logging was its greatest threat. But research
shows that one of the owl’s relatives may be the problem. For the past
15 years, the barred owl has been rapidly migrating westward. Barred
owls, which used to live exclusively east of the Mississippi, compete
for the same food as spotted owls but are more aggressive and
adaptable.

In a similar way, our greatest spiritual conflict often comes not from
outside the church, but from other Christians. This was happening in
the church of Corinth, and Paul took some time to address the divisive
spirit that had grown in this congregation. This spirit threatened the
unity of the church. Paul, with a pastoral nudge, encouraged the
Corinthians to agree on the essentials and not be divided over the
nonessentials. People were quarreling because they were aligning
themselves with different Christian leaders—Paul, Apollos, Peter, and
even Christ. In creating these divisions, they were valuing their
favorite leader above unity in Christ.

Paul said the one essential that should unify the church is preaching
the good news. That should be our united goal as well.
