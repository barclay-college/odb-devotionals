Help From His Spirit

What does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy, and
to walk humbly with your God? —
Micah 6:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Micah 6:3-8

Many of us make promises to ourselves to mark the beginning of a new
year. We make pledges such as I’m going to save more, exercise more,
or spend less time on the Internet. We begin the year with good
intentions, but before long old habits tempt us to take up our old
ways. We slip up occasionally, then more frequently, and then all the
time. Finally, it’s as if our resolution never existed.

Instead of choosing our own self-improvement goals, a better approach
might be to ask ourselves: “What does the Lord desire of me?” Through
the prophet Micah, God has revealed that He wants us to do what is
right, to be merciful, and to walk humbly with Him (Mic. 6:8). All of
these things relate to soul-improvement rather than self-improvement.

Thankfully, we don’t have to rely on our own strength. The Holy Spirit
has the power to help us as believers in our spiritual growth. God’s
Word says, He is able to “strengthen you with power through his Spirit
in your inner being” (Eph. 3:16 niv).

So as we begin a new year, let’s resolve to be more Christlike. The
Spirit will help us as we seek to walk humbly with God.
