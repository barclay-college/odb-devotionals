Our Foundation

For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which
is Jesus Christ. —
1 Corinthians 3:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 3:1-11

The Bavarian city of Nördlingen is unique. It sits in the middle of
the Ries Crater, a large circular depression caused by the impact of a
huge meteorite a long time ago. The immense pressure of the impact
resulted in unusual crystallized rock and millions of microscopic
diamonds. In the 13th century, these speckled stones were used to
build St. George’s Church. Visitors can see the beautiful crystal
deposits in its foundation and walls. Some might say it has a heavenly
foundation.

The Bible talks of a different kind of heavenly foundation. The Lord
Jesus came to our world from heaven (John 3:13). When He went back
into heaven after His death and resurrection, He left His followers
who became the “living temple” of God, of which He is the foundation.
The apostle Paul says, “For no other foundation can anyone lay than
that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ” (1 Cor. 3:11).

The church building in Bavaria is built on a foundation from pieces of
rock from the physical heavens. But the spiritual church—all believers
in Christ—is founded on the ultimate heavenly foundation, Christ Jesus
(Isa. 28:16; 1 Cor. 10:3-4). Praise God that because of what Jesus has
done our salvation is secure.

Reflect & Pray

On Christ salvation rests secure; The Rock of Ages will endure; Nor
can that faith be overthrown Which rests upon the “Living Stone.”
—Anon.

Christ, the Rock, is our sure hope.
