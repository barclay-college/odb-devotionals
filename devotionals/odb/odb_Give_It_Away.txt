Give It Away

I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, . . . whom
you sent to take care of my needs.
Philippians 2:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:19-30

Many charities that help people with various needs depend on donations
of unwanted clothing and household items from those who have more than
enough. And it’s good to give away unused things so they can benefit
others. But we are often more reluctant to part with things of value
that we use every day.

When Paul was imprisoned in Rome, he needed continuing encouragement
and the companionship of trusted friends. Yet he sent two of his
closest comrades to help the followers of Jesus in Philippi (Phil.
2:19-30). “I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon . . .
. I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your
welfare” (vv. 19-20). And, “I think it is necessary to send back to
you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is
also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs” (v. 25).
Paul freely gave to others what he most needed himself.

Whatever we feel is “most valued” in our lives today could be of great
benefit to someone we know. It may be our time, friendship,
encouragement, a listening ear, or a helping hand. When we give away
what the Lord has given to us, He is honored, others are helped, and
we are blessed.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, show me what I cling to. If someone needs it, open my heart and
my hands and help me give it away today.

Giving freely honors the Lord, helps others, and blesses us.
