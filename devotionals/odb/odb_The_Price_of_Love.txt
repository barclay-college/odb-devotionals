The Price of Love

He poured out his life unto death.
Isaiah 53:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 53:9–12

Our daughter burst into tears as we waved goodbye to my parents. After
visiting us in England, they were starting their long journey back to
their home in the US. “I don’t want them to go,” she said. As I
comforted her, my husband remarked, “I’m afraid that’s the price of
love.”

We might feel the pain of being separated from loved ones, but Jesus
felt the ultimate separation when He paid the price of love on the
cross. He, who was both human and God, fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy
700 years after Isaiah gave it when He “bore the sin of many” (Isa.
53:12). In this chapter we see rich pointers to Jesus being the
suffering Servant, such as when He was “pierced for our
transgressions” (v. 5), which happened when He was nailed to the cross
and when one of the soldiers pierced His side (John 19:34), and that
“by his wounds we are healed” (Isa. 53:5).

Because of love, Jesus came to earth and was born a baby. Because of
love, He received the abuse of the teachers of the law, the crowds,
and the soldiers. Because of love, He suffered and died to be the
perfect sacrifice, standing in our place before the Father. We live
because of love.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God who takes away our sins, have mercy
on us, and help us to extend mercy and love to others. Show us how we
might share Your love with others today.

Jesus was the perfect sacrifice who died to give us life.
