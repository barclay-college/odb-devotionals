The Viral Gospel

The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and
Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere.
1 Thessalonians 1:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 1:1–10

The Viral Texts project at Northeastern University in Boston is
studying how printed content in the 1800s spread through
newspapers—the social media network of that day. If an article was
reprinted 50 times or more, they considered that “viral” for the
Industrial Age. Writing in Smithsonian magazine, Britt Peterson noted
that a nineteenth-century news article describing which followers of
Jesus were executed for their faith appeared in at least 110 different
publications.

When the apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Thessalonica, he
commended them for their bold and joyful witness to Jesus. “The Lord’s
message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith
in God has become known everywhere” (1 Thess. 1:8). The message of the
gospel went viral through these people whose lives had been
transformed by Jesus Christ. In spite of difficulties and persecution,
they could not remain silent.

We convey the story of forgiveness and eternal life in Christ through
kind hearts, helping hands, and honest words from all of us who know
the Lord. The gospel transforms us and the lives of those we meet.

May the message ring out from us for all to hear today!
