Awakened By A Close Friend

Where I am, there you may be also. —
John 14:3

Today's Scripture: John 14:1-7

A few years ago I had some tests to screen for cancer, and I was
nervous about the outcome. My anxiety was magnified as I thought about
the fact that while the medical personnel were well-trained and
extremely competent, they were also strangers who had no relationship
with me.

After awakening from the anesthesia, however, I heard the beautiful
sound of my wife’s voice: “It’s great, Honey. They didn’t find
anything.” I looked up at her smiling face and was comforted. I needed
the assurance of someone who loved me.

A similar assurance lies ahead for all who have trusted Jesus.
Believers can be comforted in knowing that when they wake up in
heaven, One who loves them greatly—Jesus—will be there.

The Book of Common Prayer expresses this Christian hope: “After my
awakening, [my Redeemer] will raise me up; and in my body I shall see
God. I myself shall see, and eyes behold Him who is my friend and not
a stranger.”

Do you have trouble facing mortality? Jesus promised to be there when
we slip from this world into the next. He said, “Where I am [heaven],
there you may be also” (John 14:3). What a comfort for believers to
know that after death we will be awakened by a close Friend.

Reflect & Pray

What wonders await us in yonder fair land! The face of our Savior, the
touch of His hand, No tears and no crying, no sighs or despair, For
Jesus is waiting to welcome us there. —Kerr

To see Jesus will be heaven’s greatest joy.
