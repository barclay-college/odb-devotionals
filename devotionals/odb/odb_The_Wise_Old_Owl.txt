The Wise Old Owl

He who restrains his lips is wise. —
Proverbs 10:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 10:17-21

Years ago an anonymous writer penned a short poem about the merits of
measuring our words.

A wise old owl sat in an oak;

The more he saw the less he spoke;

The less he spoke the more he heard;

Why can’t we all be like that wise old bird?

There is a connection between wisdom and limiting what we say.
Proverbs 10:19 says, “In the multitude of words sin is not lacking,
but he who restrains his lips is wise.”

We are wise to be careful about what we say or how much we say in
certain situations. It makes sense to guard our words when we are
angry. James urged his fellow believers, “Be swift to hear, slow to
speak, slow to wrath” (James 1:19). Restraining our words can also
show reverence for God. Solomon said, “God is in heaven, and you on
earth; therefore let your words be few” (Eccl. 5:2). When others are
grieving, our silent presence may help more than abundant expressions
of sympathy: “No one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief
was very great” (Job 2:13).

Although there is a time to be quiet and a time to speak (Eccl. 3:7),
choosing to speak less allows us to hear more.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, please grant me wisdom to know when to speak and when to
listen. I want to encourage others and to care for them as You have
cared for me.

Let your speech be better than silence; otherwise be silent.
