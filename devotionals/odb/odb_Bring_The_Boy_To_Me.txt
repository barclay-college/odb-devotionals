Bring The Boy To Me

[Jesus] answered him and said, “. . . Bring him to Me.” —
Mark 9:19

Today's Scripture: Mark 9:14-27

“I don’t believe in God and I won’t go,” Mark said.

Amy struggled to swallow the lump in her throat. Her son had changed
from a happy boy to a surly and uncooperative young man. Life was a
battleground, and Sunday had become a day to dread, as Mark refused to
go to church with the family. Finally his despairing parents consulted
a counselor, who said: “Mark must make his own faith journey. You
can’t force him into the kingdom. Give God space to work. Keep
praying, and wait.”

Amy waited—and prayed. One morning the words of Jesus that she had
read echoed through her mind. Jesus’ disciples had failed to help a
demon-possessed boy, but Jesus had the answer: “Bring him to Me” (Mark
9:19). The sun shone through the window at Amy’s side, making a pool
of light on the floor. If Jesus could heal in such an extreme
situation, then surely He could also help her son. She pictured
herself and Mark standing in that light with Jesus. Then she mentally
stepped back, leaving her son alone with the One who loved him even
more than she did.

Every day Amy silently handed Mark to God, clinging to the assurance
that He knew Mark’s needs, and would in His time and in His way, work
in his life.

Reflect & Pray

Father, I lift my beloved to You, knowing that You love him even more
than I do and You understand just what to do to meet his need. I
commit him to Your care.

Prayer is the voice of faith trusting that God knows and cares.
