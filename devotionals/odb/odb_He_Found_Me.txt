He Found Me

The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost. —
Luke 19:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 19:1-10

The film Amazing Grace was set in the late 1700s. It tells the story
of William Wilberforce, a politician who was driven by his faith in
Christ to commit his money and energy to abolishing the slave trade in
England. In one scene, Wilberforce’s butler finds him praying. The
butler asks, “You found God, Sir?” Wilberforce responds, “I think He
found me.”

The Bible pictures humanity as wayward and wandering sheep. It says,
“All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his
own way” (Isa. 53:6). In fact, this wayward condition is so deeply
rooted in us that the apostle Paul said: “There is none righteous, no,
not one; there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after
God. They have all turned aside” (Rom. 3:10-12). That is why Jesus
came. We would never seek Him, so He came seeking us. Jesus declared
His mission with the words, “For the Son of Man has come to seek and
to save that which was lost” (Luke 19:10).

Wilberforce was exactly right. Jesus came to find us, for we could
never have found Him if left to ourselves. It is a clear expression of
the Creator’s love for His lost creation that He pursues us and
desires to make us His own.

Reflect & Pray

Amazing grace—how sweet the sound—that saved a wretch like me! I once
was lost but now am found, was blind, but now I see. John Newton

Once lost, now found. Eternally thankful!
