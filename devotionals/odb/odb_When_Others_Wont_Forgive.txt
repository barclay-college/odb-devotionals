When Others Won’t Forgive

Forgetting those things which are behind . . . I press toward the
goal. —
Philippians 3:13-14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:12-16

I was having lunch with two men who had opened their lives to Christ
while they were in prison. The younger man had been discouraged by the
fact that the family from whom he had stolen would not forgive him.

“My crime was violent,” the older man said. “It continues to haunt and
affect the family to this day. They have not forgiven me, . . . the
pain is just too great. At first, I found myself paralyzed by this
longing for their forgiveness.” He continued his story: “Then one day
I realized I was adding selfishness to my brokenness. It’s a lot to
expect that the family forgive me. I was focused on what I felt I
needed to heal from my past. It took some time to realize that their
forgiveness of me was a matter between them and God.”

“How can you stand it?” the younger man asked.

The older man explained that God did for him what he didn’t deserve
and what others simply can’t do: He died for our sins, and He keeps
His promise to move our sins “as far as the east is from the west”
(Ps. 103:12) and “will not remember [our] sins” (Isa. 43:25).

In the face of such great love, we honor Him by accepting His
forgiveness as sufficient. We must forget what lies behind and keep
pressing forward (Phil. 3:13-14).

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, for the work of Christ on the cross. Help me to
understand and accept what it means for me, and to be a messenger of
that forgiveness to those I meet along the way.

The work of Christ is sufficient for every sin.
