Giving the Gift of Prayer

You help us by your prayers.
2 Corinthians 1:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:28–34

“I didn’t realize what a gift prayer was until my brother was sick and
you all prayed for him. I cannot tell you what a comfort your prayers
were!”

Laura had tears in her eyes as she thanked me for the prayers of the
people in our church for her brother, who was facing a cancer
diagnosis. She continued, “Your prayers have strengthened him in this
difficult time and have been an encouragement to our entire family.”

One of the best ways to love others is to pray for them. Jesus is our
ultimate example in this. The New Testament tells us about Jesus
praying for others on many occasions, and even shows us that He
continues to come to the Father on our behalf. Romans 8:34 says that
He “is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.” Even
after showing such selfless love at the cross, the risen and ascended
Lord Jesus Christ continues to express His care for us by praying for
us at this very moment.

All around us are people who need us to follow Jesus’s example and
love them with our prayers, inviting God’s help and intervention in
their lives. We can ask God to help us pray for them, and He will! May
our loving Lord strengthen us to generously give the gift of our
prayers for others today.
