Is There Hope?

“He is not here; for He is risen, as He said.” —
Matthew 28:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 28:1-10

I sat quietly at the graveside of my father, waiting for the private
family burial of my mother to begin. The funeral director carried the
urn that held her ashes. My heart felt numb and my head was in a fog.
How can I handle losing them both within just 3 months? In my grief I
felt loss and loneliness and a little hopeless facing a future without
them.

Then the pastor read about another graveside. On the first day of the
week, early in the morning, women went to Jesus’ tomb, carrying spices
for His body (Matt. 28:1; Luke 24:1). There they were startled to find
an open and empty tomb—and an angel. “Do not be afraid,” he said to
them (Matt. 28:5). They didn’t need to be afraid of the empty tomb or
of the angel, because he had good news for them.

Hope stirred when I heard the next words: “He is not here; for He is
risen, as He said” (v.6). Because Jesus had come back to life, death
had been conquered! Jesus reminded His followers just a few days
before His death: “Because I live, you will live also” (John 14:19).

Even though we grieve at the loss of our loved ones, we find hope
through the resurrection of Jesus and His promise that there is life
after death.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for comfort and hope. What would we do without You?
Your death and resurrection provide all we need for this life and the
next.

Because He lives, we live.
