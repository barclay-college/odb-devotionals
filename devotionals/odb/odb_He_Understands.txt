He Understands

The Lord is my light and my salvation.
Psalm 27:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 27:1–8

Some young children have trouble falling asleep at night. While there
may be many reasons for this, my daughter explained one of them as I
turned to leave her bedroom one evening. “I’m afraid of the dark,” she
said. I tried to relieve her fear, but I left a nightlight on so she
could be sure that her room was monster-free.

I didn’t think much more about my daughter’s fear until a few weeks
later when my husband went on an overnight business trip. After I
settled into bed, the dark seemed to press in around me. I heard a
tiny noise and jumped up to investigate. It turned out to be nothing,
but I finally understood my daughter’s fear when I experienced it
myself.

Jesus understands our fears and problems because He lived on the earth
as a human and endured the same types of trouble we face. “He was
despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar
with pain” (Isa. 53:3). When we describe our struggles to Him, He
doesn’t brush us aside, minimize our feelings, or tell us to snap out
of it—He relates to our distress. Somehow, knowing that He understands
can dispel the loneliness that often accompanies suffering. In our
darkest times, He is our light and our salvation.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Jesus, I believe that You hear my prayers and that You understand
my situation. You are the One who lights my darkness.

Jesus is our light in the darkest night.
