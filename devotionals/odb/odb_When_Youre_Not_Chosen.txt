When You’re Not Chosen

Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias.
Acts 1:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 1:15–26

My friend’s Facebook post announced he had finished a project. Others
congratulated him, but his post knifed my heart. That project was
supposed to be mine. I had been passed over, and I wasn’t sure why.

Poor Joseph. He was passed over by God, and he knew why. Joseph was
one of two men in the running to replace Judas. The disciples prayed,
“Lord, you know everyone’s heart. Show us which of these two you have
chosen” (Acts 1:24). God chose the other guy. Then He announced His
decision to the group, when “the lot fell to Matthias” (v. 26).

As the disciples congratulated Matthias, I wonder about Joseph. How
did he handle his rejection? Did he feel jilted, wallow in self-pity,
and distance himself from the others? Or did he trust God and
cheerfully remain in a supportive role?

I know which option is best. And I know which option I’d want to take.
How embarrassing! If you don’t want me, fine. Let’s see how you do
without me. That choice might feel better, but only because it’s
selfish.

Joseph isn’t mentioned again in Scripture, so we don’t know how he
reacted. More relevant is how we respond when we’re not chosen. May we
remember that Jesus’s kingdom matters more than our success, and may
we joyfully serve in whatever role He selects.

Reflect & Pray

How do you feel when you’re not chosen or are left out? How could your
attitude be hindering you from seeing God’s direction for your life?

Father, as long as I can serve in Your kingdom, it doesn’t matter how
or where.
