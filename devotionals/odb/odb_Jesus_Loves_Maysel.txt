Jesus Loves Maysel

This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us.
1 John 4:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:7–16

When my sister Maysel was little, she would sing a familiar song in
her own way: “Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells
Maysel.” This irritated me to no end! As one of her older, “wiser”
sisters, I knew the words were “me so,” not “Maysel.” Yet she
persisted in singing it her way.

Now I think my sister had it right all along. The Bible does indeed
tell Maysel, and all of us, that Jesus loves us. Over and over again
we read that truth. Take, for example, the writings of the apostle
John, “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (John 21:7, 20). He tells us
about God’s love in one of the best-known verses of the Bible: John
3:16, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”

John reinforces that message of love in 1 John 4:10: “This is love:
not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an
atoning sacrifice for our sins.” Just as John knew Jesus loved him, we
too can have that same assurance: Jesus does love us. The Bible tells
us so.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for the assurance that You love us. We are filled
with gratitude that You love us so much that You died for us.

Jesus loves me! This I know.
