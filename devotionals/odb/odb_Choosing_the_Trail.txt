Choosing the Trail

Small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a
few find it.
Matthew 7:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 7:13–14

I have a beautiful autumn photograph of a young man on horseback in
the Colorado mountains as he contemplates which trail ahead to follow.
It reminds me of Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken.” In it,
Frost ponders two pathways that lie before him. Both are equally
inviting, but he doubts he will return to this place again, and he
must choose one. Frost wrote, “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I
took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.”

In Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7), the Lord told His
listeners, “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and
broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through
it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and
only a few find it” (7:13–14).

On our journey through life, we face many choices about which road to
travel. Many pathways seem promising and attractive but only one is
the pathway of life. Jesus calls us to travel the road of discipleship
and obedience to God’s Word—to follow Him instead of the crowd.

As we ponder the road ahead, may God give us wisdom and courage to
follow His way—the road of life. It will make all the difference for
us and those we love!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, as we go through this day, give us eyes to see the narrow road
that leads to life and the courage to follow it.

Choose to walk the road of life with Jesus.
