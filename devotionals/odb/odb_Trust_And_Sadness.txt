Trust And Sadness

Even in laughter the heart may sorrow. —
Proverbs 14:13

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 1:3-11

In early 1994, when our family found out that the US soccer team would
be playing in Michigan in the World Cup, we knew we had to go.

What a great time we had as we went to the Pontiac Silverdome to see
the US take on Switzerland! It was one of the most remarkable events
of our lives.

There was just one problem. One of our four children, 9-year-old
Melissa, couldn’t join us. While we enjoyed the event, it was not the
same without her. Even in our joy at being there, we felt sadness
because of her absence.

As I think back on that day, I’m reminded that our sadness then is a
little like our sadness now that Melissa is gone from this life—having
died in a car accident 8 years after that game. While we cherish the
help of the “God of all comfort” (2 Cor. 1:3), even that great comfort
doesn’t change the reality of her empty chair at family gatherings.
Scripture doesn’t tell us that God wipes away our sadness in this
life, but it does tell us that God is faithful and will comfort us.

If you have lost a loved one, lean heavily on God’s comfort. Keep
trusting Him. But know that it’s okay to feel sadness for this
absence. Consider it one more reason to place your burdens on your
loving heavenly Father.

Reflect & Pray

I have been through the valley of weeping, The valley of sorrow and
pain; But the God of all comfort was with me, At hand to uphold and
sustain. —Garlock

Earth has no sorrow that heaven does not feel.
