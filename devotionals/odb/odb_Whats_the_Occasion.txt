What’s the Occasion?

Everything God does will endure forever.
Ecclesiastes 3:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 3:9–17

Four-year-old Asher’s gleeful face peeked out from beneath his
favorite hooded sweatshirt. His alligator-head hooded sweatshirt,
complete with plush jaws that seemed to swallow his head! His mom’s
heart sank. She wanted the family to make a good impression as they
visited a family they hadn’t seen in a long time.

“Oh, Hon,” she said, “that may not be appropriate for the occasion.”

“Of course it is!” Asher protested brightly.

“Hmm, and what occasion might that be?” she asked. Asher replied, “You
know. Life!” He got to wear the shirt.

That joyful boy already grasps the truth of Ecclesiastes 3:12—“There
is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while
they live.” Ecclesiastes can seem depressing and is often
misunderstood because it’s written from a human perspective, not
God’s. The writer, King Solomon, asked, “What do workers gain from
their toil?” (v. 9). Yet throughout the book we catch glimpses of
hope. Solomon also wrote: “That each of [us] may eat and drink, and
find satisfaction in all [our] toil—this is the gift of God” (v. 13).

We serve a God who gives us good things to enjoy. Everything He does
“will endure forever” (v. 14). As we acknowledge Him and follow His
loving commands, He infuses our lives with purpose, meaning, and joy.
