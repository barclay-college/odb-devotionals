The Gift Of Remembering

Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him. —
Genesis 40:23

Today's Scripture: Genesis 40:1-14,23

During seminary, I worked in a nursing home. As I spent time talking
to these men and women, at some point nearly every patient would
describe the loneliness of their present lives and the realization
that they were outliving their peers. Most wondered if anyone would
remember them when they passed from this life.

It isn’t just the elderly who can feel lonely and forgotten. In fact,
many of us feel trapped and alone, set aside by circumstances fair and
unfair. Sometimes we even experience what the Old Testament character
Joseph did: people failing to remember us when there’s every reason
they should.

Genesis 40 describes Joseph’s experiences as he’s trapped in prison.
The cupbearer had been freed and returned to the king’s service, just
as Joseph told him would happen (vv.9-13). Joseph had asked to be
mentioned to Pharaoh, but the cupbearer forgot him (vv.14,23).

We may feel forgotten. Yet, like Joseph, we are not (42:9-13). Jesus
sits at the right hand of God, and our prayers reach the throne of the
King without fail because our Savior is our Mediator. When we feel
alone, let’s remember to rest in the confidence of Jesus’ promise to
be with us forever (Matt. 28:20).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, let me be found serving others, as Joseph did, in those hours
when I feel most forgotten. May I never be the “cupbearer” who fails
to bring the lonely and hurting to Your attention in prayer.

Jesus never abandons or forgets His own.
