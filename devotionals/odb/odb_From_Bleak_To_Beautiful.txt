From Bleak To Beautiful

The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. —
Job 42:12

Today's Scripture: Job 42:10-17

Spring is the time of year when God reminds us that things are not
always as they seem. Over the course of a few short weeks, what
appears hopelessly dead comes to life. Bleak woodlands are transformed
into colorful landscapes. Trees whose naked arms reached to heaven all
winter, as if pleading to be clothed, suddenly are adorned with lacy
green gowns. Flowers that faded and fell to the ground in surrender to
the cold rise slowly from the earth in defiance of death.

In Scripture, we read about some apparently hopeless situations. One
example is that of a wealthy man named Job whom God described as
having integrity (Job 2:3). Disaster struck and Job lost everything
important to him. In misery, he said, “My days are . . . spent without
hope” (7:6). What appeared to Job and his friends as evidence that God
had turned against him was just the opposite. God was so confident of
Job’s integrity that He trusted him in this battle with Satan. Later,
Job’s hope and life were renewed.

The faithful arrival of spring every year comforts me when I’m in a
situation that seems hopeless. With God, there is no such thing. No
matter how bleak the landscape of life may look, God can transform it
into a glorious garden of color and fragrance.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, we pray for faith anew, For greater trust in all we do, For
hope that never knows defeat, For victory at Thy mercy seat. —Brandt

With God, there is hope even in the most hopeless situation.
