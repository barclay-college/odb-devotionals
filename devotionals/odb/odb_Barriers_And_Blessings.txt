Barriers And Blessings

Many . . . believed in Him because of the word of the woman who
testified, “He told me all that I ever did.” —
John 4:39

Today's Scripture: John 4:27-39

What did Jesus see when He looked at the woman at the well in John 4?
He saw someone who wanted acceptance and desperately needed to know
she was loved. Most of all, He saw someone who needed what only He
could give—a new heart.

It was no accident that the disciples had all gone to town to buy
food. Surely, they would have tried to warn Jesus not to talk to this
person—a woman, a Samaritan, and someone with a bad reputation.

Not being one to follow protocol, however, Jesus used this encounter
to bless her with the truth of “living water” (John 4:10). In just one
conversation, He broke down barriers of old hostilities, of gender
bias, of ethnic and racial divides. And this woman became the first of
many Samaritans to confess that Jesus was the Messiah (vv.39-42).

When she told others of her encounter with a Man who knew “all that I
ever did,” she was already practicing the principle of “sowing and
reaping” that Jesus was teaching His followers (John 4:35-38). Many
believed that day, and later Philip, Peter, John, and others would
preach in Samaria and lead many more to Christ (Acts 8:5-14; 15:3).

When we tell others of our own “encounter” with Jesus, we bless them
with living water.
