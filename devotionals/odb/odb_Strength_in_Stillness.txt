Strength in Stillness

In quietness and confidence shall be your strength. —
Isaiah 30:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 14:10-14

Early in my Christian life the demands of commitment made me wonder if
I could make it past a year without returning to my old sinful ways.
But this Scripture verse helped me: “The Lord will fight for you; you
need only to be still” (Exod. 14:14 niv). These are the words Moses
spoke to the Israelites when they had just escaped from slavery in
Egypt and were being pursued by Pharaoh. They were discouraged and
afraid.

As a young believer, with temptations engulfing my world, this call
“to be still” encouraged me. Now, some 37 years later, remaining still
and calm while trusting Him in the midst of stress-laden situations
has been a constant desire for my Christian living.

“Be still, and know that I am God,” the psalmist says (Ps. 46:10).
When we remain still, we get to know God, “our refuge and strength, a
very present help in trouble” (v. 1). We see our weakness apart from
God and recognize our need to surrender to Him. “When I am weak, then
I am strong,” says the apostle Paul (2 Cor. 12:10).

Daily we grind through stress and other frustrating situations. But we
can trust that He will be faithful to His promise to care for us. May
we learn to be still.
