Life Without Bread

I am the bread of life. —
John 6:48

Today's Scripture: John 6:25-35

In cultures with an abundance of food choices, bread is no longer a
necessary part of the diet so some choose to live without it for
various reasons. In the first century, however, bread was viewed as an
essential staple. A diet without bread was a foreign concept.

One day a crowd of people sought out Jesus because He had performed
the miracle of multiplying loaves of bread (John 6:11,26). They asked
Him to perform a sign like the manna from heaven that God had provided
for His people in the desert (6:30-31; Ex. 16:4). When Jesus said He
was “the true bread from heaven” (John 6:32), the people didn’t
understand. They wanted literal daily bread. But Jesus was saying that
He had been sent to be their spiritual bread; He would supply their
daily spiritual needs. If they, by faith, applied and took His words
and life into their very souls, they would experience everlasting
satisfaction (v.35).

Jesus doesn’t want to be an optional commodity in our diets; He
desires to be the essential staple in our lives, our “necessary” food.
As first-century Jews could never imagine life without physical bread,
may we never attempt to live without Jesus, our spiritual bread!
