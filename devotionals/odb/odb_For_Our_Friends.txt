For Our Friends

My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.
John 15:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 15:5–17

In Emily Bronte’s novel Wuthering Heights, a cantankerous man who
often quotes the Bible to criticize others is memorably described as
“the wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible
to rake [apply] the promises to himself and fling the curses to his
neighbours.”

It’s a funny line; and it may even bring particular people to mind.
But aren’t we all a bit like this—prone to condemn others’ failures
while excusing our own?

In Scripture some people amazingly did the exact opposite; they
were willing to give up God’s promises for them and even be cursed if
it would save others. Consider Moses, who said he’d rather be blotted
out of God’s book than see the Israelites unforgiven (Exodus 32:32).
Or Paul, who said he’d choose to be “cut off from Christ” if it meant
his people would find Him (Romans 9:3).

As self-righteous as we naturally are, Scripture highlights those who
love others more than themselves.

Because ultimately such love points to Jesus. “Greater love has no one
than this,” Jesus taught, than “to lay down one’s life for one’s
friends” (John 15:13). Even before we knew Him, Jesus loved us “to the
end” (13:1)—choosing death to give us life.

Now we are invited into the family of God, to love and be loved like
this (15:9–12). And as we pour into others Christ’s unimaginable love,
the world will catch a glimpse of Him.

Lord, thank You for showing us what it means to love. Help us to love
