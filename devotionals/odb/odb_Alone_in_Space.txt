Alone in Space

Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.
Genesis 28:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 28:10–17

Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden knew what it felt like to be on the far
side of the moon. For three days back in 1971, he flew alone in his
command module, Endeavor, while two crewmates worked thousands of
miles below on the surface of the moon. His only companions were the
stars overhead that he remembers as being so thick they seemed to wrap
him in a sheet of light.

As the sun went down on the Old Testament character Jacob’s first
night away from home, he too was profoundly alone, but for a different
reason. He was on the run from his older brother—who wanted to kill
him for stealing the family blessing normally given to the firstborn
son. Yet on falling asleep, Jacob had a dream of a staircase joining
heaven and earth. As he watched angels ascending and descending, he
heard the voice of God promising to be with him and to bless the whole
earth through his children. When Jacob woke he said, “Surely the Lord
is in this place, and I was not aware of it” (Gen. 28:16).

Jacob had isolated himself because of his deceit. Yet as real as his
failures, and as dark as the night, he was in the presence of the One
whose plans are always better and more far-reaching than our own.
Heaven is closer than we think, and the “God of Jacob” is with us.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for using the story of Jacob to show us that the
glory of Your unseen presence and goodness is far greater than we
could imagine.

God is nearer than we think.
