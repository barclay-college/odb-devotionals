Keeping Faith

Without faith it is impossible to please God.
Hebrews 11:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 10:32–11:6

It’s tempting to think of faith as a kind of magic formula. If you
muster up enough of it, you’ll get rich, stay healthy, and live a
contented life with automatic answers to all your prayers. But life
does not work according to such neat formulas. As proof, the author of
Hebrews presents a stirring reminder of what constitutes “true faith”
by reviewing the lives of some Old Testament giants of faith (Heb.
11).

“Without faith,” the author says bluntly, “it is impossible to please
God” (11:6). In describing faith he uses the word persevered (v. 27).
As a result of their faith, some heroes triumphed: They routed armies,
escaped the sword, survived lions. But others met less happy ends:
They were flogged, stoned, sawed in two. The chapter concludes, “These
were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had
been promised” (v. 39).

The picture of faith that emerges does not fit into an easy formula.
Sometimes it leads to victory and triumph. Sometimes it requires a
gritty determination to “hang on at any cost.” Of such people, “God is
not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for
them” (v. 16).

What our faith rests on is the belief that God is in ultimate control
and will indeed keep His promises—whether that happens in this life or
the next.

Reflect & Pray

Give me a faith that trusts You wholeheartedly, Lord.

Our greatest comfort in sorrow is to know that God is in control.
