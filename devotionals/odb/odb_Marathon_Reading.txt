Marathon Reading

They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving
the meaning so that the people understood what was being read.
Nehemiah 8:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Nehemiah 8:1–8

When the sun came up on the first day of the seventh month in 444 bc,
Ezra started reading the law of Moses (what we know as the first five
books of the Bible). Standing on a platform in front of the people in
Jerusalem, he read it straight through for the next six hours.

Men, women, and children had gathered at the entrance to the city
known as the Water Gate to observe the Festival of Trumpets—one of the
feasts prescribed for them by God. As they listened, four reactions
stand out.

They stood up in reverence for the Book of the Law (Neh. 8:5). They
praised God by lifting their hands and saying “Amen.” They bowed down
in humble worship (v. 6). Then they listened carefully as the
Scriptures were both read and explained to them (v. 8). What an
amazing day as the book that “the Lord had commanded for Israel” (v.
1) was read aloud inside Jerusalem’s newly rebuilt walls!

Ezra’s marathon reading session can remind us that God’s words to us
are still meant to be a source of praise, worship, and learning. When
we open the Bible and learn more about Christ, let’s praise God,
worship Him, and seek to discover what He is saying to us now.
