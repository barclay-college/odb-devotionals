Living in Tents

From there he went on towards the hills east of Bethel and pitched his
tent.
Genesis 12:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 12:4–9

Growing up in Minnesota, a place known for its many beautiful lakes, I
loved to go camping to enjoy the wonders of God’s creation. But
sleeping in a flimsy tent wasn’t my favorite part of the
experience—especially when a rainy night and a leaky tent resulted in
a soggy sleeping bag.

I marvel to think that one of the heroes of our faith spent a hundred
years in tents. When he was seventy-five years old, Abraham heard
God’s call to leave his country so the Lord could make him into a new
nation (Gen. 12:1–2). Abraham obeyed, trusting that God would follow
through on His promise. And for the rest of his life, until he died at
175 (25:7), he lived away from his home country in tents.

We may not have the same call as Abraham did to live nomadically, but
even as we love and serve this world and the people in it, we may long
for a deeper experience of home, of being rooted here on earth. Like
Abraham, when the wind whips our flimsy covering or the rain soaks
through, we can look with faith for the city to come, whose “architect
and builder is God” (Heb. 11:10). And like Abraham, we can find hope
that God is working to renew His creation, preparing a “better
country—a heavenly one” to come (v. 16).
