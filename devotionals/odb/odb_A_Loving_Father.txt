A Loving Father

As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear
Him. —
Psalm 103:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 103:7-13

The parents were obviously weary from dragging their two energetic
preschoolers through airports and airplanes, and now their final
flight was delayed. As I watched the two boys running around the
crowded gate area, I wondered how Mom and Dad were going to keep the
little guys settled down for our half-hour flight into Grand Rapids.
When we finally boarded, I noticed that the father and one of the sons
were in the seats behind me. Then I heard the weary father say to his
son, “Why don’t you let me read one of your storybooks to you.” And
during the entire flight, this loving father softly and patiently read
to his son, keeping him calm and focused.

In one of his psalms David declares, “As a father pities his children,
so the Lord pities those who fear Him” (Ps. 103:13). The word pities
refers to showing love and compassion. This tender word gives us a
picture of how deeply our heavenly Father loves His children, and it
reminds us what a great gift it is to be able to look to God and cry,
“Abba, Father” (Rom. 8:15).

God longs for you to listen again to the story of His love for you
when you are restless on your own journey through life. Your heavenly
Father is always near, ready to encourage you with His Word.
