Friending

You are My friends if you do whatever I command you. —
John 15:14

Today's Scripture: John 15:9-17

The social networking Web site Facebook.com was launched in 2004 as a
way for college students to connect with each other online. It is now
open to people of all ages, and currently there are an estimated 500
million users. Each user has an individual page with photos and
personal details that can be viewed by “friends.” To “friend” a person
means opening the door to communication and information about who you
are, where you go, and what you do. Facebook friendships may be casual
or committed, but each one is “by invitation only.”

Just before Jesus was crucified, He told His disciples: “You are My
friends if you do whatever I command you. No longer do I call you
servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I
have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I
have made known to you” (John 15:14-15).

Unselfishness, oneness of purpose, and confident trust are the
hallmarks of true friendship, especially in our relationship with the
Lord. Christ has taken the initiative by giving His life for us and
inviting us to know and follow Him.

Have we responded to the Lord Jesus’ invitation of friendship by
opening our hearts to Him with nothing held back?
