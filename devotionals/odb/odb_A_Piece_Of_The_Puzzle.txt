A Piece Of The Puzzle

God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He
pleased. —
1 Corinthians 12:18

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 12:12-27

At her birthday celebration, the honored guest turned the tables by
giving everyone at the party a gift. Kriste gave each of us a personal
note expressing what we mean to her, along with encouraging words
about the person God made us to be. Enclosed with every note was one
piece of a jigsaw puzzle as a reminder that each of us is unique and
important in God’s plan.

That experience helped me to read 1 Corinthians 12 with new eyes. Paul
compared the church—the body of Christ—to a human body. Just as our
physical bodies have hands, feet, eyes, and ears, all are part of a
unified body. No follower of Christ can claim independence from the
body, nor can one part tell another that it is not needed (vv.12-17).
“God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He
pleased” (v.18).

It’s easy to feel less important than others whose gifts are different
and perhaps more visible than ours. The Lord, however, wants us to see
ourselves as He does—uniquely created and highly valued by Him.

You are one piece of a picture that is not complete without you. God
has gifted you to be an important part of the body of Christ to bring
Him honor.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me not to compare myself with others in Your family. May I
seek instead to be the person You’ve made me to be, and help me to use
what You’ve given me to bless others today.

Your life is God’s gift to you; make it your gift to God.
