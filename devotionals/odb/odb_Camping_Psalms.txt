Camping Psalms

Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
Psalm 8:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 8:1–9

When my husband and I go for nature walks, we bring our cameras and
take close-ups of the plants at our feet, which are like microcosms of
the world. What amazing variety and beauty we see, even in the fungi
that spring up overnight and dot the woods with splashes of bright
orange, red, and yellow!

The snapshots of life that surround us inspire me to lift my eyes to
the Maker who created not only mushrooms but also the stars in the
heavens. He designed a world of infinite scope and variety. And He
made you and me and placed us in the very middle of this beauty to
enjoy and to rule over it (Gen. 1:27–28; Ps. 8:6–8).

My thoughts turn to one of our family’s “camping psalms”—psalms we
read as we sit around the fire. “Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your
name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens. . . .
When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and
the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are
mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?” (Ps. 8:1–4).

How amazing that the great God who created the world in all its
splendor cares for you and me!
