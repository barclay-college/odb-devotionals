Your Way, Not Mine

Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own
understanding.
Proverbs 3:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 22:39–46

Kamil and Joelle were devastated when their eight-year-old daughter
Rima was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. The disease led to
meningitis and a stroke, and Rima lapsed into a coma. The hospital
medical team counseled her parents to make arrangements for Rima’s
funeral, giving her less than a one percent chance of survival.

Kamil and Joelle fasted and prayed for a miracle. “As we pray,” Kamil
said, “we need to trust God no matter what. And pray like Jesus—not my
way, Father, but Yours.” “But I want so much for God to heal her!”
Joelle answered honestly. “Yes! And we should ask!” Kamil responded.
“But it honors God when we give ourselves to Him even when it’s hard,
because that’s what Jesus did.”

Before Jesus went to the cross, He prayed: “Father, if you are
willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done”
(Luke 22:42). By praying “take this cup,” Jesus asked not to go to the
cross; but He submitted to the Father out of love.

Surrendering our desires to God isn’t easy, and His wisdom can be
difficult to understand in challenging moments. Kamil and Joelle’s
prayers were answered in a remarkable way—Rima is a healthy fifteen
year old today.

Jesus understands every struggle. Even when, for our sake, His request
was not answered, He showed us how to trust our God in every need.

Reflect & Pray

I want to be “all in” for You, Father. I trust in Your unfailing love
and give myself to You as Your servant today.

God always deserves our commitment and praise.
