True Hospitality

Let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of
life freely. —
Revelation 22:17

Today's Scripture: Revelation 22:16-21

In 1987, our family moved to California to take up the pastorate of a
church in the Long Beach area. The day we flew into town, my secretary
picked us up at the airport to take us to our house. As we pulled into
traffic, the very first thing I saw was a bumper sticker that read:
“Welcome To California . . . Now Go Home!” It was not exactly a warm
and cheery welcome to sunny southern California!

I wonder if there might be occasions in our lives when we send similar
signals to people around us. Whether we are at church, in the
neighborhood, or at social gatherings, are there times when we fail to
make others feel welcome in our world?

In Romans 12:13, Paul instructed his readers to be “given to
hospitality.” The book of Hebrews goes even further, saying, “Do not
forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly
entertained angels” (13:2). By showing gracious kindness to those who
come our way, we echo the Savior’s invitation for salvation, which
declares, “Let him who hears say, ‘Come!’ And let him who thirsts
come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely” (Rev.
22:17).

To show someone loving hospitality just might be the first step in
showing that person the way to heaven.

Reflect & Pray

Give as ’twas given to you in your need; Love as the Master loved you;
Be to the helpless a helper indeed; Unto your mission be true. —Wilson

Live so that when people get to know you, they will want to get to
know Christ.
