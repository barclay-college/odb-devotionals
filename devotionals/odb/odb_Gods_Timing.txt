God’s Timing

For every matter there is a time and judgment. —
Ecclesiastes 8:6

Today's Scripture: Exodus 13:17-22

Pastor Audley Black’s church near the south coast of Jamaica has been
in a building program since at least 2005. That was the first time I
visited his church and saw that they were expanding. The last time I
was there—in the spring of 2011—some of the walls were up. By that
summer, they had started on the roof. When I suggested to Pastor Black
that perhaps the church would be done by 2013 when I thought I might
return, he said it was a possibility.

There was no hint of disappointment that this project could take 8
years or longer! No, Pastor Black and his people are excited about
what God is doing, and they’re patient with His timing.

We are often not that patient. We want our church to grow quickly, our
young people to mature right away, and our problems to be fixed today.

Maybe we need to be reminded that some things take time—God’s time.
For instance, when the Israelites first left Egypt, God sent them on
the long route to the Promised Land (Ex. 13:17-18). During that time
He prepared them, taught them, and challenged them.

In our microwave world, we want everything done instantaneously. But
sometimes that’s not God’s plan. Let’s seek God’s help and learn to
accept His timing.

Reflect & Pray

He does not lead me year by year, Nor even day by day; But step by
step my path unfolds; My Lord directs my way. —Ryberg

God’s timetable may move slowly, but it does move surely.
