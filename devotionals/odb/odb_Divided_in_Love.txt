Divided in Love

Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another
in love.
Ephesians 4:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:2–6

When public debate erupted over a controversial Singapore law, it
divided believers with differing views. Some called others “narrow-
minded” or accused them of compromising their faith.

Controversies can cause sharp divisions among God’s family, bringing
much hurt and discouraging people. I’ve been made to feel small over
personal convictions on how I apply the Bible’s teachings to my life.
And I’m sure I’ve been equally guilty of criticizing others I disagree
with.

I wonder if the problem lies not in what or even in how we express our
views, but in the attitudes of our hearts when we do so. Are we just
disagreeing with views or seeking to tear down the people behind them?

Yet there are times when we need to address false teaching or explain
our stand. Ephesians 4:2–6 reminds us to do so with humility,
gentleness, patience, and love. And, above all else, to make every
effort “to keep the unity of the Spirit” (v. 3).

Some controversies will remain unresolved. God’s Word, however,
reminds us that our goal should always be to build up people’s faith,
not tear them down (v. 29). Are we putting others down to win an
argument? Or are we allowing God to help us understand His truths in
His time and His way, remembering that we share one faith in one Lord?
(vv. 4–6).

Reflect & Pray

How can you explain your stand on sensitive issues humbly, gently, and
lovingly? What will you pray for those who seem to disagree?

God, guide me as I speak the truth so that I do so out of love and
seek only to build up, not to tear down.
