Why Cause Grief?

Obey those who rule over you, . . . for they watch out for your souls.
—
Hebrews 13:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 13:17-19

Pastors make an easy target for criticism. Every week they are on
display, carefully explaining God’s Word, challenging us toward
Christlike living. But sometimes we look to find things to criticize.
It’s easy to overlook all the good things a pastor does and focus on
our personal opinions.

Like all of us, our pastors are not perfect. So I’m not saying that we
should follow them blindly and never confront error through the proper
channels. But some words from the writer of Hebrews may help us find
the right way of thinking about our leaders who are presenting God’s
truth and modeling servant leadership. The writer says, “Have
confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they
keep watch over you as those who must give an account” (13:17 niv).

Think about that. Before God, our pastor is responsible for guiding us
spiritually. We should want that burden to be joyous, not grievous.
The passage indicates that causing grief for the pastor “would be of
no benefit” (v.17 niv).

We honor God and make things better for our church when we give honor
to those He has appointed as our leaders.

Reflect & Pray

Our gracious Father, thank You for the person You led to our church as
pastor. May we provide encouragement and support, and may You protect
our pastor from error in both word and actions.

Pastors who preach God’s Word need a good word from God’s people.
