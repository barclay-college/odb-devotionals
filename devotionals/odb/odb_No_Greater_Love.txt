No Greater Love

Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his
friends. —
John 15:13

Today's Scripture: John 15:1-13

Bill and his wife were driving through the Rocky Mountains when a
near-miss with a truck caused their car to swerve off the road and
plunge into the Colorado River. After scrambling out of their sinking
vehicle, they frantically treaded water in the swift current. A
truckdriver, who had seen the accident, ran ahead along the shore and
threw a rope to them. Bill swam behind his wife and pushed her to
where she could grab the rope—and the man pulled her out. Bill,
however, was carried downstream and didn’t survive. He had given his
life for the woman he loved.

To give your life so another person can live is the ultimate proof of
love. During the night that Jesus was betrayed, He told His disciples
of His intention to give His life in exchange for mankind. He told
them: “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life
for his friends” (John 15:13). And then He set the ultimate example of
self-sacrifice by going to the cross.

Have you ever given any thought to the fact that Jesus did that for
you—that He died in your place? In so doing, He not only proved His
love for you, but He also made it possible for you to be forgiven of
your sins and to have an eternal home in heaven.
