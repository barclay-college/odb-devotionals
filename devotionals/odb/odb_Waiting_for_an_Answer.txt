Waiting for an Answer

Those who know your name trust in you, for you, Lord, have never
forsaken those who seek you.
Psalm 9:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 9:1-10

When our daughter was 15, she ran away. She was gone more than 3
weeks. Those were the longest 3 weeks of our lives. We looked
everywhere for her and sought help from law enforcement and friends.
During those desperate days, my wife and I learned the importance of
waiting on God in prayer. We had come to the end of our strength and
resources. We had to rely on God.

It was on a Father’s Day that we found her. We were in a restaurant
parking lot, on our way to dinner, when the phone rang. A waitress at
another restaurant had spotted her. Our daughter was only three blocks
away. We soon had her home, safe and sound.

We have to wait on God when we pray. We may not know how or when He
will answer, but we can put our hearts constantly before Him in
prayer. Sometimes the answers to our prayers don’t come when we would
hope. Things may even go from bad to worse. But we have to persevere,
keep believing, and keep asking.

Waiting is never easy, but the end result, whatever it is, will be
worth it. David put it this way: “Those who know your name trust in
you, for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you” (Ps.
9:10). Keep seeking. Keep trusting. Keep asking. Keep praying.
