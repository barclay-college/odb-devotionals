A Place of Shelter

I long to . . . take refuge in the shelter of your wings.
Psalm 61:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 61

Homeless people in Vancouver, British Columbia, have a new way to find
nighttime accommodations. A local charity, RainCity Housing, has
created specialized benches that convert into temporary shelters. The
back of the bench pulls up to create a roof that can shield a person
from wind and rain. At night, these sleeping spaces are easy to find
because they feature a glow-in-the-dark message that reads: THIS IS A
BEDROOM.

The need for shelter can be physical, and it can be spiritual as well.
God is a refuge for our souls when we are troubled. King David wrote,
“I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher
than I” (Ps. 61:2). When we’re emotionally overloaded, we are more
vulnerable to the Enemy’s tactics—fear, guilt, and lust are a few of
his favorites. We need a source of stability and safety.

If we take refuge in God, we can have victory over the Enemy as he
tries to influence our hearts and minds. “You have been my refuge, a
strong tower against the foe,” David said to the Lord. “I long to . .
. take refuge in the shelter of your wings” (vv. 3-4).

When we are overwhelmed, peace and protection are ours through God’s
Son, Jesus Christ. “In me you may have peace,” Jesus said. “In this
world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the
world” (John 16:33).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, I am frail and defenseless, but You are mighty and powerful.
Please help me find peace and rest in You when I am overwhelmed.

God is our refuge.
