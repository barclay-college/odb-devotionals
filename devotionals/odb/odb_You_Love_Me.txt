You Love Me?

How have you loved us?
Malachi 1:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Malachi 1:1–5

As a teenager, I went through the typical season of rebellion against
my mother’s authority. My father died before I entered adolescence, so
my mom had to navigate these turbulent parenting waters without his
help.

I recall thinking that Mom didn’t want me to ever have any fun—and
maybe didn’t even love me—because she frequently said no. I see now
that she said no to activities that weren’t good for me precisely
because she loves me.

The Israelites questioned how much God loved them because of their
time in captivity in Babylon. But that captivity was God’s correction
for their continued rebellion against Him. So now, God sent the
prophet Malachi to them. His opening words from the Lord were, “I have
loved you” (Malachi 1:2). Israel replied skeptically, inquiring as to
how God has loved them, as if to say, “Really?” But God, through
Malachi, reminded them of the way He had demonstrated that love: He
had chosen them over the Edomites.

We all go through difficult seasons in life. We may be tempted to
question God’s love for us during those times. Let’s recall the many
ways He’s shown us His unfailing love. When we stop to consider His
goodness, we find that He is indeed a loving Father.

Lord, You have shown tender care for me over the course of my life.
You’ve been present with me in difficult seasons. Help me to always
remember Your love.

Our heavenly Father corrects us and comforts us.
