Probing Questions

Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a
defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you.
—
1 Peter 3:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 3:8-17

While riding on a train a few years after the American Civil War,
General Lew Wallace of the Union Army encountered a fellow officer,
Colonel Robert Ingersoll. Ingersoll was one of the 19th century’s
leading agnostics, and Wallace was a man of faith. As their
conversation turned to their spiritual differences, Wallace realized
that he wasn’t able to answer the questions and doubts raised by
Ingersoll. Embarrassed by his lack of understanding about his own
faith, Wallace began searching the Scriptures for answers. The result
was his confident declaration of the person of the Savior in his
classic historical novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.

Probing questions from skeptics don’t have to be a threat to our
faith. Instead, they can motivate us to seek a deeper understanding
and equip us to respond wisely and lovingly to those who might
question our faith. The apostle Peter encouraged us to pursue the
wisdom of God in the Scriptures when he wrote, “Always be ready to
give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is
in you, with meekness and fear” (1 Peter 3:15).

We don’t have to have an answer for every question, but we need the
courage, confidence, and conviction to share our love for Christ and
the hope that is in us.
