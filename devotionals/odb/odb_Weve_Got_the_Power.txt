We’ve Got the Power!

Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
Galatians 5:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 7:14–25

The loud crackling noise startled me. Recognizing the sound, I raced
to the kitchen. I’d accidently tapped the start button on the empty
coffee maker. Unplugging the appliance, I grabbed the handle of the
carafe. Then I touched the bottom of the container to ensure it wasn’t
too hot to place on the tile counter. The smooth surface burned my
fingertips, blistering my tender skin.

As my husband nursed my wound, I shook my head. I knew the glass would
be hot. “I honestly do not know why I touched it,” I said.

My response after making such a mistake reminded me of Paul’s reaction
to a more serious issue in Scripture—the nature of sin.

The apostle admits to not knowing why he does things he knows he
shouldn’t do and doesn’t want to do (Rom. 7:15). Affirming that
Scripture determines right and wrong (v. 7), he acknowledges the real,
complex war constantly waging between the flesh and the spirit in the
struggle against sin (vv. 15–23). Confessing his own weaknesses, he
offers hope for victory now and forever (vv. 24–25).

When we surrender our lives to Christ, He gives us His Holy Spirit who
empowers us to choose to do right (8:8–10). As He enables us to obey
God’s Word, we can avoid the searing sin that separates us from the
abundant life God promises those who love Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thanks for breaking the chains that used to bind us to a life
controlled by our sinful nature.

The Holy Spirit transforms us through His love and by His grace.
