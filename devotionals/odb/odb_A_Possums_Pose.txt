A Possum’s Pose

[The Lord] neither faints nor is weary. —
Isaiah 40:28

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 28:5-6, 15-20

Possums are known for their ability to play dead. When this happens,
the possum’s body wilts, its tongue flops out, and its heart rate
declines. After about 15 minutes, the animal revives. Interestingly,
animal experts do not believe that possums purposefully play dead to
evade predators. They faint involuntarily when they become overwhelmed
and anxious!

King Saul had a similar response to danger at the end of his reign.
Saul “fell full length on the ground, and was dreadfully afraid . . .
. And there was no strength in him” (1 Sam. 28:20). He responded this
way when the prophet Samuel told him that the Philistines would attack
Israel on the next day, and that the Lord was not going to help him.
Because Saul’s life had been characterized by disobedience, rashness,
and jealousy, God was no longer guiding him (v.16), and his efforts to
defend himself and the Israelites would be futile (v.19).

We may be in a place of weakness and despair because of our rebellion
or because of the difficulties of life. Although anxiety can steal our
strength, God can renew it as we lean on Him (Isa. 40:31). He “neither
faints nor is weary” (v.28), and He is willing to reach down and
revive us when we can’t take another step.

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, You mean the world to me. You are my life and my all. I’m
thankful for the strength that You give from day to day. I know that
without You I am nothing.

The secret of peace is to give every anxious care to God.
