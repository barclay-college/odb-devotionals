Amnesia

My understanding returned to me; and I blessed the Most High.
Daniel 4:34

Today's Scripture: Daniel 4:28–37

Emergency Services in Carlsbad, California, came to the rescue of a
woman with an Australian accent who couldn’t recall who she was.
Because she was suffering from amnesia and had no ID with her, she was
unable to provide her name or where she had come from. It took the
help of doctors and international media to restore her health, tell
her story, and reunite her with her family.

Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, also lost sight of who he was and
where he had come from. His “amnesia,” though, was spiritual. In
taking credit for the kingdom he’d been given, he forgot that God is
the King of Kings, and everything he had was from Him (Daniel 4:17,
28–30).

God dramatized the king’s state of mind by driving him into the fields
to live with wild animals and graze like a cow (vv. 32–33). Finally,
after seven years Nebuchadnezzar looked up to the skies, and his
memory of who he was and who had given him his kingdom returned. With
his senses restored, he declared, “I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt
and glorify the King of heaven” (v. 37).

What about us? Who do we think we are? Where did we come from? Since
we are inclined to forget, who can we count on to help us remember but
the King of Kings?

Reflect & Pray

Father, we are so inclined to forget who we are, where we’ve come
from, and that we belong to You. Help us to remember that in Christ we
are Your children—known, loved, gifted, and cared for—now and forever.

When we forget who we are, our Father cares.
