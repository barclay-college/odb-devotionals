Everywhere and Nowhere

Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?
Psalm 139:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:7–12

A family friend who, like us, lost a teenager in a car accident wrote
a tribute to her daughter, Lindsay, in the local paper. One of the
most powerful images in her essay was this: After mentioning the many
pictures and remembrances of Lindsay she had put around their house,
she wrote, “She is everywhere, but nowhere.”

Although our daughters still smile back at us from their photos, the
spirited personalities that lit up those smiles are nowhere to be
found. They are everywhere—in our hearts, in our thoughts, in all
those photos—but nowhere.

But Scripture tells us that, in Christ, Lindsay and Melissa are not
really nowhere. They are in Jesus’s presence, “with the Lord” (2
Corinthians 5:8). They are with the One who, in a sense, is “nowhere
but everywhere.” After all, we don’t see God in a physical form. We
certainly don’t have smiling pictures of Him on our mantel. In fact,
if you look around your house, you may think He is nowhere. But just
the opposite is true. He is everywhere!

Wherever we go on this earth, God is there. He’s there to guide,
strengthen, and comfort us. We cannot go where He is not. We don’t see
Him, but He’s everywhere. In each trial we face, that’s incredibly
good news.
