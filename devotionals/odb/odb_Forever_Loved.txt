Forever Loved

Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself.
Psalm 4:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 4:1–8

It’s almost impossible for us to get through a day without being
snubbed, ignored, or put down in some way. Sometimes we even do it to
ourselves.

David’s enemies were talking smack—bullying, threatening, pummeling
him with insults. His sense of self-worth and well-being had plummeted
(Ps. 4:1–2). He asked for relief “from my distress.”

Then David remembered, “Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful
servant for himself” (v. 3). Various English versions try to capture
the full essence of David’s bold statement by translating “faithful
servant” as “godly.” The Hebrew word here, hesed, literally refers to
God’s covenant love and might well be rendered “those whom God will
love forever and ever and ever.”

Here’s what we too must remember: We are loved forever, set apart in a
special way, as dear to God as His own Son. He has called us to be His
children for all eternity.

Instead of despairing, we can remind ourselves of the love we freely
receive from our Father. We are His dearly beloved children. The end
is not despair but peace and joy (vv. 7–8). He never gives up on us,
and He never ever stops loving us.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, the words of others can wound us deeply. Your words
to us heal and comfort, and You assure us that we are loved forever.

The true measure of God’s love is that He loves without measure.
Bernard of Clairvaux
