The Great Creator-Healer

I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. —
Psalm 139:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:1-16

A few years ago, I had a rather serious skiing accident and severely
tore the muscles in one of my legs. In fact, my doctor told me that
the tear caused excessive bleeding. The healing process was slow, but
during that time of waiting I found myself in awe of our great Creator
(see Col. 1:16).

I’ve wrinkled a few car fenders in my lifetime and dropped more than
one dish. They’ve always stayed broken. Not so with my leg. As soon as
the tearing of my muscles occurred, the internal healing mechanisms
that Christ created in my body went to work. Invisibly, down deep in
my throbbing leg, the medics of His marvelous design were mending the
tear. Before long, I was up and running again with a whole new sense
of what the psalmist meant when he said that we are “fearfully and
wonderfully made,” and my heart was filled with praise (Ps. 139:14).

Sometimes it takes something like an injury or a sickness to remind us
of the masterful design that we carry around in our bodies. So the
next time you face an unwanted interruption—no matter its cause—focus
your attention on Jesus’ wonderful love and let Him lift your heart to
grateful worship in the midst of the pain!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help us to see beyond the moments of our lives and to delve
deeply into Your marvelous handiwork and perfect design. Forgive us
for our short-sightedness and teach us to see You in every
circumstance.

Worship of the masterful Creator begins with a grateful heart.
