When Yes Means No

I call on the Lord in my distress, and he answers me.
Psalm 120:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:22–28

I thanked God for the privilege of serving as my mom’s live-in
caregiver during her battle against leukemia. When medicines began to
hurt more than help, she decided to stop treatment. “I don’t want to
suffer anymore,” she said. “I want to enjoy my last days with family.
God knows I’m ready to go home.”

I pleaded with our loving heavenly Father—the Great
Physician—confident He could work miracles. But to say yes to my mom’s
prayers, He would have to say no to mine. Sobbing, I surrendered,
“Your will be done, Lord.”

Soon after, Jesus welcomed my mama into a pain-free eternity.

In this fallen world, we’ll experience suffering until Jesus returns
(Rom. 8:22–25). Our sinful nature, limited vision, and fear of pain
can distort our ability to pray. Thankfully, “the Spirit intercedes
for God’s people in accordance with the will of God” (v. 27). He
reminds us that in all things God works for the good of those who love
Him (v. 28), even when His yes to someone else means a heartbreaking
no for us.

When we accept our small part in His greater purpose, we can echo my
mom’s watchword: “God is good, and that’s all there is to it. Whatever
He decides, I’m at peace.” With confidence in the Lord’s goodness, we
can trust Him to answer every prayer according to His will and for His
glory.
