Step Up!

[Asa] took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the
land . . . ; and he restored the altar of the Lord. —
2 Chronicles 15:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Chronicles 15:1-12

When a woodchuck started eating our garage (well, just the trim), I
bought a live trap with plans to transplant the little guy to a park.
I baited it with an assortment of goodies and opened the trap door.
The next morning, I was excited to see a little critter in my
trap—until I noticed that it was no woodchuck. I had snared a skunk.

I went online to see how to untrap the skunk without having it . . .
well, you know. The solutions were extremely cautious in their
descriptions of how to protect yourself while releasing the animal.
Plastic bags. Gloves. Tarps. Blankets. Goggles. The task looked
daunting and dangerous.

Then my son-in-law Ewing stepped up. He simply walked over to the
trap, opened the door, and coaxed our striped friend on its way with a
few sprays from the garden hose.

Sometimes our fears can lead to inaction. We worry so much about
protecting ourselves that we fail to simply step up. When King Asa
learned that the Lord wanted him to remove the idols from Israel, he
“took courage” (2 Chron. 15:8). He could have had a rebellion on his
hands for doing this. But he stepped up, and as a result the nation
rejoiced (v.15).

Facing a spiritual challenge? The Lord will help you step up with
courage and trust Him for the outcome.

Reflect & Pray

Let the road be rough and dreary, And its end far out of sight, Foot
it bravely, strong or weary; Trust in God and do the right. —Macleod

Courage is fear that has said its prayers.
