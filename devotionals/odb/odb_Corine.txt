Corine

Be hospitable to one another without grumbling. —
1 Peter 4:9

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 4:7-11

A group of us were helping to put together packets of material at an
Our Daily Bread event in Orlando last winter when Corine greeted us.
It was mid-morning, and she was sure we must be hungry and thirsty. I
told her we were “fine,” and she replied, “I know you’re fine, but you
need something to eat.” A few minutes later she came back with cold
water and snacks.

Throughout the 2 days we were there, Corine came by to check on us,
bring us food or water, and take away our trash. On one occasion, I
thanked her and said, “You have the gift of hospitality, don’t you,
Corine!” She looked down and replied, “I don’t know. But you write the
devotional articles, and I’ll clean up. And God will be glorified.”

Corine’s desire is to bring God glory by helping people. She
definitely has the gift of hospitality and practices it well. God has
graced each of His children with skills and abilities so that He can
minister to others through us. You can find those gifts listed in
Romans 12:4-13, 1 Corinthians 12:27-31, Ephesians 4:7-12, and 1 Peter
4:9-11.

The Lord has gifted us “that in all things God may be glorified
through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion
forever and ever” (1 Peter 4:11).
