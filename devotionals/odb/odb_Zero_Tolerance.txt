Zero Tolerance

You shall not go about as a talebearer among your people. —
Leviticus 19:16

Today's Scripture: Leviticus 19:11-18

When Shayla McKnight applied for a job for an online printing company,
she was surprised to learn that they had a zero-tolerance policy for
gossip. The employees are encouraged to confront one another, instead
of gossip about their fellow employees. If employees are caught
gossiping, they are reprimanded, and if they continue, they are fired.

Long before this kind of policy was ever implemented by a company, God
spoke of His own zero-tolerance policy for gossip and slander among
His people (Lev. 19:16). Idle talk that foolishly or maliciously
spreads rumors or facts about another person was forbidden.

Solomon said that speaking badly of others could have disastrous
effects. It betrays confidence (Prov. 11:13), separates close friends
(16:28; 17:9), shames and saddles you with a bad reputation (25:9-10),
and perpetually fuels the embers of a quarrel (26:20-22). People
rarely can undo the damage their untrue words have done to a neighbor.

Let’s ask the Lord to help us not to engage in harmful talk about
others. He wants us to set a guard over our mouths so that we’ll
instead speak all the good we know about everybody.

Reflect & Pray

Many things that others say Are not for us to tell; Help us, Lord, to
watch our tongue— We need to guard it well. —Branon

Destroy gossip by ignoring it.
