Gazing at the Horizon

We are looking for the city that is to come.
Hebrews 13:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 11:8–16

Almost as soon as the ferryboat started to move, my little daughter
said she felt ill. Seasickness had already begun to affect her. Soon I
was feeling queasy myself. “Just stare at the horizon,” I reminded
myself. Sailors say this helps to regain a sense of perspective.

The Maker of the horizon (Job 26:10) knows that sometimes in life we
may become fearful and restless. We can regain perspective by focusing
on the distant but steady point of our destiny.

The writer of Hebrews understood this. He sensed discouragement in his
readers. Persecution had driven many of them from their homes. So he
reminded them that other people of faith had endured extreme trials
and had been left homeless. They endured it all because they
anticipated something better.

As exiles, these readers could look forward to the city whose
architect is God, the heavenly country, the city God prepared for them
(Hebrews 11:10, 14, 16). So in his final exhortations, the writer
asked his readers to focus on God’s promises. “For here we do not have
an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come”
(13:14).

Our present troubles are temporary. We are “foreigners and strangers
on earth” (11:13), but gazing at the horizon of God’s promises
provides the point of reference we need.
