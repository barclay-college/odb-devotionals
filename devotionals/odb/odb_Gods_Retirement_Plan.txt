God’s Retirement Plan

The angel of the Lord appeared to [Moses] in flames of fire from
within a bush.
Exodus 3:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 3:1–10

Archaeologist Dr. Warwick Rodwell was preparing to retire when he made
an extraordinary discovery at Lichfield Cathedral in England. As
builders carefully excavated part of the floor of the church to make
way for a retractable base, they discovered a sculpture of the
archangel Gabriel, thought to be 1,200 years old. Dr. Rodwell’s
retirement plans were put on hold as his find launched him into an
exciting and busy new season.

Moses was eighty years old when he made a fiery discovery that would
forever alter his life. Though the adopted son of an Egyptian
princess, he never forgot his Hebrew lineage and raged at the
injustice he witnessed against his kinsmen (Exodus 2:11–12). When
Pharaoh learned that Moses had killed an Egyptian who was beating a
Hebrew, he planned to have him killed, forcing Moses to flee to
Midian, where he settled (vv. 13–15).

Forty years later, when he was eighty, Moses was tending his father-
in-law’s flock when “the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames
of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire
it did not burn up” (3:2). In that moment, God called Moses to lead
the Israelites out of Egyptian slavery (vv. 3–22).

At this moment in your life, what might God be calling you to do for
His greater purpose? What new plans has He placed in your path?

Reflect & Pray

What do you learn from Moses and his calling from God? Why is it
vital to be open to something new He’s doing in your life?

Holy God, be Lord of all my days as I surrender them to You afresh.
