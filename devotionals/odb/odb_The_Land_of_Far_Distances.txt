The Land of Far Distances

Your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view a land that
stretches afar.
Isaiah 33:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 33:17–22

Amy Carmichael (1867–1951) is known for her work of rescuing orphaned
girls in India and giving them a new life. In the midst of this
exhausting work there were times she called “moments of vision.” In
her book Gold by Moonlight, she wrote, “In the midst of a crowded day
we are given almost a glimpse of ‘the land of far distances,’ and we
stand still, arrested on the road.”

The prophet Isaiah spoke of a time when God’s rebellious people would
turn back to Him. “Your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view
a land that stretches afar” (Isaiah 33:17). To view this “land of far
distances” is to be lifted above the circumstances of the immediate
present and to gain an eternal perspective. During difficult times,
the Lord enables us to see our lives from His viewpoint and regain
hope. “For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord
is our king; it is he who will save us” (v. 22).

Each day, we can choose to look down in discouragement or lift our
eyes to “the land of far distances,” to the Lord who is “our Mighty
One” (v. 21).

Amy Carmichael spent more than fifty years in India helping young
women in great need. How did she do it? Each day she fixed her eyes on
Jesus and placed her life in His care. And so can we.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, today we lift our eyes from the circumstances that discourage us
to see You in Your splendor, and find peace.

Fix your eyes on Jesus.
