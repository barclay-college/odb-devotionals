The Hope That Banishes Hopelessness

God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ. —
Galatians 6:14

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:5-11

When atheistic communism was a world-menacing power, it proclaimed
that there is no God and that faith in any future life is a deceptive
illusion. Leonid Brezhnev had been the Soviet dictator, the embodiment
of Marxist unbelief. But something happened at his funeral that
contradicted atheism. George H. W. Bush, then vice president of the
US, was the country’s official representative at the solemn, formal
ceremony.

He reported that while the casket was still open, Brezhnev’s widow
stared motionless at her husband’s body. And just before the soldiers
were about to close the lid, she reached inside and made the sign of
the cross over his chest. What a desperate and significant gesture!
That widow evidently hoped that what her husband had vehemently denied
might somehow be true.

Thankfully, we can have hope beyond this earthly life! All we need to
do is embrace by faith the saving message of the cross: Jesus died for
our sins and rose again so that we might live eternally with Him. Do
you believe? Then join with the apostle Paul in affirming that “we
trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of
those who believe” (1 Tim. 4:10).

Reflect & Pray

The cross is my hope for eternity— No merit have I of my own; The shed
blood of Christ my only plea— My trust is in Jesus alone.
—Christiansen

Calvary’s cross is the only bridge to eternal life.
