Always in His Care

You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from
afar.
Psalm 139:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:1-18

Veteran news reporter Scott Pelley never goes on assignment without
his travel essentials—a shortwave radio, camera, indestructible
suitcase, laptop computer, phone, and an emergency locator beacon that
works anywhere. “You extend the antenna, push two buttons, and it
sends a signal to a satellite connected to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration,” Pelley says. “It tells them who and where
I am. Depending on what country you’re in, they’ll either send a
rescue team—or not” (AARP The Magazine). Pelley has never needed to
use the beacon, but he never travels without it.

But when it comes to our relationship with God, we don’t need radios,
phones, or emergency beacons. No matter how precarious our
circumstances become, He already knows who and where we are. The
psalmist celebrated this as he wrote, “You have searched me, Lord, and
you know me. . . . You are familiar with all my ways”  (Ps. 139:1-3).
Our needs are never hidden from God, and we are never separated from
His care.

Today, we can say with confidence, “If I rise on the wings of the
dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand
will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast” (vv. 9-10).

The Lord knows who we are, where we are, and what we need. We are
always in His care.

O Lord, we praise You for Your never-ending love and Your never-
failing care.

We are always in His care.
