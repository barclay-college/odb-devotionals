Living in God’s Story

The night is nearly over; the day is almost here.
Romans 13:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 13:8–14

Ernest Hemingway was asked if he could write a compelling story in six
words. His response: “For sale: Baby shoes. Never worn.” Hemingway’s
story is powerful because it inspires us to fill in the details. Were
the shoes simply not needed by a healthy child? Or was there a tragic
loss—something requiring God’s deep love and comfort?

The best stories pique our imagination, so it’s no surprise that the
greatest story ever told stokes the fires of our creativity. God’s
story has a central plot: He created all things; we (the human race)
fell into sin; Jesus came to Earth and died and rose again to save us
from our sins; and we now await His return and the restoration of all
things.

Knowing what has come before and what lies ahead, how should we now
live? If Jesus is restoring His entire creation from the clutches of
evil, we must “put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of
light” (Romans 13:12). This includes turning from sin by God’s power
and choosing to love Him and others well (vv. 8–10).

The specific ways we fight with Jesus against evil will depend on what
gifts we have and what needs we see. Let’s use our imagination and
look around us. Let’s seek out the wounded and weeping, and extend
God’s justice, love, and comfort as He guides us.
