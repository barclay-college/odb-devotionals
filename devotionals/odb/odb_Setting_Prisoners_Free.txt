Setting Prisoners Free

The Lord sets prisoners free.
Psalm 146:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 146

When my wife and I visited the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth
Air Force near Savannah, Georgia, we were especially moved by the
prisoner-of-war exhibit, with its re-creation of a German prisoner-of-
war camp’s barracks. Marlene’s dad, Jim, served in the Eighth Air
Force, the “Mighty Eighth,” as they flew missions over Europe during
World War II. During the war, the Eighth Air Force suffered over
47,000 injuries and more than 26,000 deaths. Jim was one of those shot
down and held as a prisoner of war. As we walked through the exhibit,
we recalled Jim telling about the absolute joy he and his fellow
prisoners felt the day they were set free.

God’s care for the oppressed and liberation of the imprisoned are
declared in Psalm 146. The psalmist describes the one who “upholds the
cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry,” who “sets
prisoners free” (v. 7). All of this is cause for celebration and
praise. But the greatest freedom of all is freedom from our guilt and
shame. No wonder Jesus said, “So if the Son sets you free, you will be
free indeed” (John 8:36).

Through Christ’s sacrifice, we are set free from the prison of sin to
know His joy and love and the freedom that only forgiveness can bring.

The prison of sin cannot withstand the power of Christ’s forgiveness.
