Living Beyond The Odds

Constant prayer was offered to God for [Peter] by the church. —
Acts 12:5

Today's Scripture: Acts 12:1-11

Many of us make daily decisions based on the odds. If there’s a 20
percent chance of rain, we may ignore it. If there’s a 90 percent
chance, we’ll take an umbrella. The greater the odds, the more our
behavior is affected because we want to choose wisely and be
successful.

Acts 12:1-6 describes a situation in which Peter’s odds of survival
were very low. He was in prison, “bound with two chains between two
soldiers” while others guarded the door (v.6). Herod had already
executed James, one of Jesus’ closest followers, and he had the same
fate in mind for Peter (vv.1-3). A gambler would not have put any
money on Peter getting out of this alive.

Yet God’s plan for Peter included a miraculous deliverance that even
those who were interceding for him found hard to believe (vv.13-16).
They were astonished when he showed up at their prayer meeting.

God can operate outside the odds because He is all-powerful. Nothing
is too hard for Him. The One who loves us and gave Himself for us is
in charge of our lives. In ordinary circumstances and impossible
situations, God can reveal His power. Whether we are showered with
success or sustained in sorrow, He is with us.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, we’re so thankful that nothing is too difficult for You. You
can do amazing things! Help us to trust that You are always with us
and always in control. We love You, Lord.

God is always in control behind the scenes.
