God’s Reminders

He said to them, “Do you still not understand?”
Mark 8:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 8:11–21

My friend Bob Horner refers to Jesus as “the Master Reminder.” And
that is good, because we are so doubting and forgetful. No matter how
often Jesus met the needs of the people who came to Him when He was
here on earth, His first disciples feared they would somehow be left
in need. After witnessing miracles, they failed to understand the
greater meaning the Lord wanted them to remember.

On a journey across the Sea of Galilee, the disciples realized they
had forgotten to bring bread and were talking about it. Jesus asked
them, “Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t
you remember?” (Mark 8:17–18). Then He reminded them that when He fed
five thousand people with five loaves, the disciples had collected
twelve basketfuls of leftover pieces. And when He fed four thousand
with seven loaves, they filled seven baskets with leftovers. Then “He
said to them, ‘Do you still not understand?’” (v. 21).

The Lord’s miraculous provision for people’s physical needs pointed to
the greater truth—that He was the Bread of Life and that His body
would be “broken” for them and for us.

Every time we eat the bread and drink the cup during the Lord’s
Supper, we are reminded of our Lord’s great love and provision for us.

Reflect & Pray

In the Lord's Supper, Jesus left us a great reminder of His sacrifice.
Read about it in Matthew 26:17–30; Luke 22:14–20; 1 Corinthians
11:23–26.

Communion is the Lord’s reminder to us of His love and provision.
