Forever Love

And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love.
1 John 4:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 136:1–9

Years ago, my four-year-old son gave me a framed wooden heart mounted
on a metal plate with the word forever painted in its center. “I love
you forever, Mommy,” he said.

I thanked him with a hug. “I love you more.”

That priceless gift still assures me of my son’s never-ending love. On
tough days, God uses that sweet present to comfort and encourage me as
He affirms I’m deeply loved.

The frame also reminds me of the gift of God’s everlasting love, as
expressed throughout His Word and confirmed by His Spirit. We can
trust God’s unchanging goodness and sing grateful praises that confirm
His enduring love, as the psalmist does (Psalm 136:1). We can exalt
the Lord as greater than and above all (vv. 2–3), as we reflect on His
endless wonders and unlimited understanding (vv. 4–5). The God who
loves us forever is the conscious and caring Maker of the heavens and
earth, who maintains control of time itself (vv. 6–9).

We can rejoice because the everlasting love the psalmist sang about is
the same continuing love our all-powerful Creator and Sustainer pours
into the lives of His children today. No matter what we’re facing, the
One who made us and remains with us strengthens us by asserting He
loves us unconditionally and completely. Thank You, God, for the
countless reminders of Your endless and life-transforming love!
