Plight of the Crawdads

Always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.
1 Thessalonians 5:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:11–18

When my cousin invited me to join him to fish for crawdads (crayfish),
I couldn’t help but be excited. I grinned when he handed me a plastic
pail. “No lid?”

“You won’t need one,” he said, picking up the fishing rods and the
small bag of chicken chunks we’d use for bait.

Later, as I watched the small crustaceans climbing over one another in
a futile attempt to escape the almost-full bucket, I realized why we
wouldn’t need a lid. Whenever one crawdad reached the rim, the others
would pull it back down.

The plight of the crawdads reminds me how destructive it is to be
selfishly concerned about our own gain instead of the benefit of a
whole community. Paul understood the need for uplifting,
interdependent relationships when he wrote to the believers in
Thessalonica. He urged them to “warn those who are idle and
disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak,” and “be
patient with everyone” (1 Thessalonians 5:14).

Commending their caring community (v. 11), Paul spurred them toward
even more loving and peaceful relationships (vv. 13–15). By striving
to create a culture of forgiveness, kindness, and compassion, their
relationships with God and others would be strengthened (vv. 15, 23).

The church can grow and witness for Christ through this kind of loving
unity. When believers honor God, committing to lift others up instead
of pulling them down with words or actions, we and our communities
thrive.
