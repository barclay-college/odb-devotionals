This Is the Day

This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

Psalm 118:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 118:19-29

In 1940, Dr. Virginia Connally, age 27, braved opposition and
criticism to become the first female physician in Abilene, Texas. A
few months before her 100th birthday in 2012, the Texas Medical
Association presented her with its Distinguished Service Award, Texas’
highest physician honor. Between those two landmark events, Dr.
Connally has enthusiastically embraced a passion for spreading the
gospel around the world through her many medical mission trips while
living a life of service to God and to others—one day at a time.

Dr. Connally’s pastor, Phil Christopher, said, “Every day for her is a
gift.” He recalled a letter in which she wrote, “Every tour, trip,
effort, I wonder if this will be my last and ultimate? Only God knows.
And this is enough.”

The psalmist wrote, “This is the day the Lord has made; we will
rejoice and be glad in it” (Ps. 118:24 nkjv). So often we focus on the
disappointments of yesterday or the uncertainties of tomorrow and miss
God’s matchless gift to us: Today!

Dr. Connally said of her journey with Christ, “As you live a life of
faith, you’re not looking for the results. I was just doing the things
that God planted in my life and heart.”

God made today. Let’s celebrate it and make the most of every
opportunity to serve others in His name.
