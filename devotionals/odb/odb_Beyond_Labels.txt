Beyond Labels

But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still
sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans 5:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:1–11

A church in my city has a unique welcome card that captures the love
and grace of God for everyone. It says, “If You Are A . . . saint,
sinner, loser, winner”—followed by many other terms used to describe
struggling people—“alcoholic, hypocrite, cheater, fearful, misfit . .
. . You are welcome here.” One of the pastors told me, “We read the
card aloud together in our worship services every Sunday.”

How often we accept labels and allow them to define who we are. And
how easily we assign them to others. But God’s grace defies labels
because it is rooted in His love, not in our self-perception. Whether
we see ourselves as wonderful or terrible, capable or helpless, we can
receive eternal life as a gift from Him. The apostle Paul reminded the
followers of Jesus in Rome that “at just the right time, when we were
still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly” (Rom. 5:6).

The Lord does not require us to change by our own power. Instead He
invites us to come as we are to find hope, healing, and freedom in
Him. “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were
still sinners, Christ died for us” (v. 8). The Lord is ready and
willing to receive us just as we are.
