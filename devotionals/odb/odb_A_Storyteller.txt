A Storyteller

You, who once were alienated . . . , yet now He has reconciled. —
Colossians 1:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:13-23

In the years following the American Civil War (1861–1865), Union Major
General Lew Wallace served as a governor of the New Mexico
territories; New Mexico not yet having been admitted as a state. His
work there put him in contact with many of the characters that make up
the Wild West’s near-mythic history, including Billy the Kid and
Sheriff Pat Garrett. It was here that Wallace wrote what has been
called by some “the most influential Christian book” of the 19th
century, Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.

Wallace witnessed the worst impact of sin on humanity as he saw the
violence of the Civil War and the Wild West. In life and in his best-
selling book, Wallace understood that only the story of Jesus Christ
has the power of redemption and reconciliation.

For the follower of Christ, the climax of our lives was the moment God
“delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the
kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His
blood, the forgiveness of sins” (Col. 1:13-14). Now we have the
privilege of being storytellers of God’s wonderful redemption.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please take control of my words today. Fill me with Your words

nothing without You.

The difference Christ makes in your life is a story worth telling.
