Trying to Impress

Out of the heart come evil thoughts . . . . These are what defile a
person.
Matthew 15:19–20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 15:1–11, 16–20

When a college class went on a cultural field trip, the instructor
almost didn’t recognize one of his star pupils. In the classroom she
had concealed six-inch heels beneath her pant legs. But in her walking
boots she was less than five feet tall. “My heels are how I want to
be,” she laughed. “But my boots are how I really am.”

Our physical appearance doesn’t define who we are; it’s our heart that
matters. Jesus had strong words for those masters of appearances—the
super-religious “Pharisees and teachers of the law.” They asked Jesus
why His disciples didn’t wash their hands before eating, as their
religious traditions dictated (Matthew 15:1–2). Jesus asked, “Why do
you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?” (v. 3).
Then He pointed out how they had invented a legal loophole to keep
their wealth instead of caring for their parents (vv. 4–6), thus
dishonoring them and violating the fifth commandment (Exodus 20:12).

If we obsess over appearances while looking for loopholes in God’s
clear commands, we’re violating the spirit of His law. Jesus said that
“out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual
immorality,” and the like (Matthew 15:19). Only God, through the
righteousness of His Son Jesus, can give us a clean heart.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we are so prone to rely on our own efforts to impress You and
others. Help us to be authentic in all our relationships, and to enjoy
the restored heart we can have through Your forgiveness.

When our motive is to impress others, we’re not impressing God.
