Lateral Violence

Whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant. —
Matthew 20:26

Today's Scripture: Matthew 20:20-28

An intriguing article in Michigan Nurse magazine called attention to
“nursing’s dirty little secret”—the incivility and verbal abuse that
occurs among some nurses. This peer-level bullying (also known as
lateral violence) takes the form of back-stabbing, innuendo,
infighting, sabotage, verbal affronts, failure to respect privacy, and
others.

Not only is lateral violence occurring among nurses, it’s a growing
problem in a host of other work environments. This bullying always
includes an imbalance of power, an intent to harm, and the threat of
further aggression.

Of course, this would never occur in the church—or would it? Think
about the personal interaction in deacon and elder boards, church
office staffs, Bible-study groups, and youth ministries. Are they ever
marked by the kinds of behavior that harm, denigrate, or intimidate
others? And what about in our families?

When the disciples were jockeying for position in the coming kingdom,
Jesus rebuked them and said, “Whoever desires to become great among
you, let him be your servant” (Matt. 20:26). With that attitude in all
our relationships, bullying will never be found among us.

Lord, may we have a servant’s heart In all we say and do By placing
others’ needs above What we want to pursue. —Sper

Only the one who serves is qualified to lead.
