Teaching By Example

Bring [your children] up in the training and admonition of the Lord. —
Ephesians 6:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 6:1-11

While waiting for an eye examination, I was struck by a statement I
saw in the optometrist’s office: “Eighty percent of everything
children learn in their first 12 years is through their eyes.” I began
thinking of all that children visually process through reading,
television, film, events, surroundings, and observing the behavior of
others, especially their families. On this Father’s Day, we often
think about the powerful influence of a dad.

Paul urged fathers not to frustrate their children to the point of
anger, but to “bring them up in the training and admonition of the
Lord” (Eph. 6:4). Think of the powerful example of a dad whose
behavior and consistency inspire admiration from his children. He’s
not perfect, but he’s moving in the right direction. A great power for
good is at work when our actions reflect the character of God, rather
than distort it.

That’s challenging for any parent, so it’s no coincidence that Paul
urges us to “be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might”
(v.10). Only through His strength can we reflect the love and patience
of our heavenly Father.

We teach our children far more from how we live than by what we say.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, I need to know Your love in order to love others. I
want to experience and share Your patience and kindness with those I
care about. Fill me and use me.

We honor fathers who not only gave us life, but who also show us how
to live.
