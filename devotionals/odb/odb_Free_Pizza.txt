Free Pizza!

I am the bread which came down from heaven. —
John 6:41

Today's Scripture: John 6:25-41

Money is tight when you’re a college student. So when free food is
available, students will show up anytime, anywhere. If a company wants
to recruit new employees, it will entice young people on college
campuses to come to a presentation by offering free pizza. Some
students attend presentation after presentation—just for the pizza.
The food in the present seems to be more important than the job for
the future.

Jesus fed a crowd of 5,000, and the next day many searched for Him
(John 6:10-11,24-25). He challenged them: “You seek Me, not because
you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled”
(v.26). It seems that the food was more important to some of the
people than the everlasting life Jesus offered in Himself. He told
them He was “the bread of God . . . who comes down from heaven and
gives life to the world” (v.33). Some didn’t believe, wouldn’t accept
His teaching, and “walked with Him no more” (v.66). They had wanted
the food, but they didn’t want Him and what would be required of them
to follow Him.

Jesus calls us today to come to Him—not for the blessings from His
hand but to receive the eternal life He offers and to follow Him, “the
bread of God.”
