Too Close

In all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.
Proverbs 3:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 3:1-18

I grew up in Oklahoma where severe weather is common from early spring
through the end of summer. I recall one evening when the sky boiled
with dark clouds, the TV weather forecaster warned of an approaching
tornado, and the electricity went out. Very quickly, my parents, my
sister, and I climbed down the wooden ladder into the storm cellar
behind our house where we stayed until the storm passed by.

Today “storm chasing” has become a hobby for many people and a
profitable business for others. The goal is to get as close as
possible to a tornado without being harmed. Many storm chasers are
skilled forecasters with accurate information, but I won’t sign up for
a tornado tour anytime soon.

In moral and spiritual areas of my life, however, I can foolishly
pursue dangerous things God tells me to avoid because of His love for
me, all the time believing I won’t be harmed. A wiser approach is to
read the book of Proverbs, which contains many positive ways to elude
these snares of life.

“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own
understanding,” Solomon wrote. “In all your ways submit to him, and he
will make your paths straight” (Prov. 3:5-6).

Our Lord is the master of the adventure of living, and following His
wisdom leads us to fullness of life.
