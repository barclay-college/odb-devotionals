Four Ways to Look

I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds.
Psalm 77:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 77:1-15

Joan was struggling with some difficult issues with her children when
she sat down for a worship service. Exhausted, she wanted to “resign”
from motherhood. Then the speaker began to share encouragement for
those who feel like quitting. These four thoughts that Joan heard that
morning helped her to keep going:

Look up and pray. Asaph prayed all night long and even expressed
feelings that God had forgotten and rejected him (Ps. 77:9-10). We can
tell God everything and be honest about our feelings. We can ask Him
anything. His answer may not come right away or in the form we want or
expect, but He won’t criticize us for asking.

Look back and remember what God has done in the past for you and
others. Asaph didn’t talk to God only about the pain; he also recalled
God’s power and mighty works for him and God’s people. He wrote, “I
will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will remember your
miracles of long ago” (v. 11).

Look forward. Think about the good that might come out of the
situation. What might you learn? What might God want to do? What do
you know He will do because His ways are perfect? (v.13).

Look again. This time look at your circumstances with eyes of faith.
Remind yourself that He is the God of great wonders and can be trusted
(v. 14).

May these ideas help us gain perspective and keep moving in our faith
journey with Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I can’t help but see my problems. Help me not to be discouraged
and weary, but to see You in the midst of them.

Our problems are opportunities to discover God’s solutions.
