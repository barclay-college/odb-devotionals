Giants in the Land

We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly
do it.
Numbers 13:30

Today's Scripture: Numbers 13:25–14:9

After being encamped near Mt. Sinai for two years, the people of
Israel were on the verge of entering Canaan—the land God had promised
them. God told them to send twelve spies to assess the land and the
people living there. When the spies saw the strength of the Canaanites
and the size of their cities, ten of them said, “We can’t!” Two said,
“We can!”

What made the difference?

When the ten compared the giants with themselves and the giants loomed
large, the two—Caleb and Joshua—compared the giants with God, and the
giants were cut down to size. “The Lord is with us,” they said. “Do
not be afraid of them” (Num. 14:9).

Unbelief never lets us get beyond the difficulties—the impregnable
cities and the impossible giants. It preoccupies itself with them,
brooding over them, pitting them against mere human resources.

Faith, on the other hand, though it never minimizes the dangers and
difficulties of any circumstance, looks away from them to God and
counts on His invisible presence and power.

What are your “giants”? A habit you cannot break? A temptation you
cannot resist? A difficult marriage? A drug-abusing son or
daughter? If we compare ourselves with our difficulties, we will
always be overwhelmed. Faith looks away from the greatness of the
undertaking to the greatness of an ever-present, all-powerful God.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, when the “giants” in my life begin to overwhelm me with
fear, help me to trust in You.

When fear knocks, answer it with faith.
