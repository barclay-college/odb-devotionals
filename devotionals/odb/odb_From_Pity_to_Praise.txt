From Pity to Praise

But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength.
2 Timothy 4:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Timothy 4:9–18

At a coat drive for children, excited kids searched gratefully for
their favorite colors and proper sizes. They also gained self-esteem,
an organizer said, with new coats boosting their acceptance by peers
and school attendance on winter days.

The apostle Paul seemed to need a coat, as well, when he wrote
Timothy, “Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas” (2 Timothy
4:13). Held in a cold Roman prison, Paul needed warmth but also
companionship. “No one came to my support, but everyone deserted me,”
he lamented, when he faced a Roman judge (v. 16). His words pierce our
hearts with the honesty of this great missionary’s pain.

Yet in these final words of Paul’s last recorded letter—his closing
thoughts after an astounding ministry—he moves from pity to praise.
“But the Lord stood at my side,” he adds (v. 17), and his words rally
our hearts. As Paul declared, “[God] gave me strength so that I might
preach the Good News in its entirety for all the Gentiles to hear. And
he rescued me from certain death” (v. 17 nlt ).

If you’re facing a crisis, lacking even the right clothing for warmth
or close friends to help, remember God. He’s faithful to revive,
provide, and deliver. Why? For His glory and for our purpose in His
kingdom.

Reflect & Pray

In what “cold” area of your life do you need God’s great and warming
strength? As you praise Him, how does your outlook change?

Our strong God, when life’s circumstances overwhelm us, stand with us,
stir our praise, giving us Your strength to overcome.
