Goodbye for Now

You do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.
1 Thessalonians 4:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18

My granddaughter Allyssa and I have a regular routine we go through
when we say goodbye. We wrap our arms around each other and begin to
loudly wail with dramatic sobs for about twenty seconds. Then we step
back and casually say, “See ya,” and turn away. Despite our silly
practice, we always expect that we will see each other again—soon.

But sometimes the pain of separation from those we care about can be
difficult. When the apostle Paul said farewell to the elders from
Ephesus, “They all wept as they embraced him . . . . What grieved them
most was [Paul’s] statement that they would never see his face again”
(Acts 20:37–38).

The deepest sorrow, however, comes when we are parted by death and say
goodbye for the last time in this life. That separation seems
unthinkable. We mourn. We weep. How can we face the heartbreak of
never again embracing the ones we have loved?

Still . . . we do not grieve like those who have no hope. Paul writes
of a future reunion for those who “believe that Jesus died and rose
again” (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18). He declares: “The Lord himself will
come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the
archangel,” and those who have died, along with those who are still
alive, will be united with our Lord. What a reunion!

And—best of all—we will be forever with Jesus. That’s an eternal hope.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for the assurance that this world is not all we have
but that a blessed eternity awaits all who trust in You.

At death, God’s people don’t say “goodbye,” but “we’ll see you later.”
