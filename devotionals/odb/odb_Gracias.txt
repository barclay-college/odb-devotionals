Gracias!

Oh, give thanks to the Lord! —
1 Chronicles 16:8

Today's Scripture: 1 Chronicles 16:7-10,23-36

When I visited Mexico, I wished I knew how to speak Spanish. I could
say gracias (thank you), muy bien (very good), and hola (hello). But
that was about it. I grew tired of just saying gracias to everyone who
talked with me or did something for me.

But we should never grow tired of giving words of thanks to God. David
knew the importance of saying thanks. After he became king over Israel
and had a tent constructed to house the ark of the covenant (where
God’s presence dwelt), he appointed some of the Levites “to
commemorate, to thank, and to praise the Lord” (1 Chron. 16:4). Many
people remained there to offer sacrifices and give thanks to God daily
(vv.37-38).

David also committed to Asaph and his associates a song of thanks (1
Chron. 16:8-36). His psalm gave thanks for what the Lord had done:
“His deeds among the peoples” (v.8), “His wondrous works” (v.9), “His
wonders, and the judgments of His mouth” (v.12), and His “salvation”
(v.35). David’s song also gave praise for who the Lord was: good,
merciful, and holy (vv.34-35).

Like David, we should never grow tired of saying gracias to God for
who He is and for all He’s done for us. Take time today to offer your
sacrifice of praise to Him.

Reflect & Pray

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven, To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Evermore His praises sing. —Lyte

The heart filled with praise brings pleasure to God.
