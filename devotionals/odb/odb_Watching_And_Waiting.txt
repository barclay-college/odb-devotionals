Watching And Waiting

The Lord said to me, “I will take My rest, and I will look from My
dwelling place.” —
Isaiah 18:4

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 18:1-5

In Isaiah 18, it appears that the whole world is set to battle God’s
people. Yet what is the response of the Almighty One? “I will take My
rest, and I will look from My dwelling place” (v.4). His stillness may
appear to have been an acceptance of the conspiracy against them. But
it wasn’t. God’s response was His reminder that He acts in His
timing—at just the right time according to His will.

I think of Jesus waiting 4 days while Lazarus lay in the grave (John
11:39). Was He unaware? Did He not care? Of course He cared! He was
waiting for the right time to act and to teach the lessons He wanted
to teach.

The Bible records God’s “delays,” many of which seem at the time to be
inexplicable from our point of view. Yet every delay flows from the
depths of His wisdom and love. If nothing else, delay, if we accept
it, can produce the quieter virtues—humility, patience, endurance, and
persistence—qualities that are often the last to be learned.

Are you in distress? Does the Lord seem distant and detached? He is
not indifferent to your plight, nor is He unmoved by your pleas. He is
waiting while His purposes are achieved. Then, at the right moment, He
will intercede. God is never in a hurry, but He is always on time.

Reflect & Pray

Turn not aside, discouraged one; Stir up your gift, pursue your goal;
In God’s own time you’ll see Him work; He’ll give you hope and lift
your soul. —D. DeHaan

God is worth waiting for; His time is always best.
