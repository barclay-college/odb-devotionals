Heavy Lifting

Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden. —
Matthew 11:28

Today's Scripture: Matthew 11:25-30

One day I found my son straining to lift a pair of four-pound barbells
over his head—an ambitious feat for a toddler. He had raised them only
a few inches off the ground, but his eyes were determined and his face
was pink with effort. I offered to help, and together we heaved the
weight up toward the ceiling. The heavy lifting that was so hard for
him was easy for me.

Jesus has this perspective on the stuff that’s hard for us to manage.
When life seems like a carousel of catastrophes, Jesus isn’t fazed by
a fender-bender, troubled by a toothache, or harassed by a heated
argument—even if it all happens in one day! He can handle anything,
and that is why He said, “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy
laden” (Matt. 11:28).

Are you worn out from ongoing problems? Are you weighed down with
stress and worry? Jesus is the only real solution. Approaching the
Lord in prayer allows us to cast our burdens on Him so that He can
sustain us (Ps. 55:22). Today, ask Him to assist you with everything.
By helping you with your burdens, He can supply rest for your soul,
for His yoke is easy and His burden is light (Matt. 11:29-30).

Reflect & Pray

O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear, All
because we do not carry Everything to God in prayer. —Scriven

Prayer is the place where burdens change shoulders.
