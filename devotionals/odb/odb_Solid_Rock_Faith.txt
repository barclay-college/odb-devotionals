Solid-Rock Faith

The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer. —
Psalm 18:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 18:1-3,46

My wife and I both have grandmothers who have lived past 100. Talking
with them and their friends, I detect a trend that seems almost
universal in the reminiscences of older people: They recall difficult
times with a touch of nostalgia. The elderly swap stories about World
War II and the Great Depression; they speak fondly of hardships such
as blizzards, the childhood outhouse, and the time in college when
they ate canned soup and stale bread 3 weeks in a row.

Paradoxically, difficult times may help nourish faith and strengthen
personal bonds. Seeing this principle lived out, I can better
understand one of the mysteries relating to God. Faith boils down to a
question of trust. If I do stand on a solid rock of trust in God (Ps.
18:2), the worst of circumstances will not destroy that relationship.

Solid-rock faith allows me to believe that despite the chaos of the
present moment, God does reign. Regardless of how worthless I may
feel, I truly matter to a God of love. No pain lasts forever, and no
evil triumphs in the end.

Solid-rock faith sees even the darkest deed of all history, the death
of God’s Son, as a necessary prelude to the brightest moment in all
history—His resurrection and triumph over death.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You are the Rock, the object of my faith. My faith stands on You
and not on my shifting feelings; otherwise I would be sure to fall.

Christ, the Rock, is our sure hope.
