God Has Time For You

This poor man cried out, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of
all his troubles. —
Psalm 34:6

Today's Scripture: Psalm 34:4-18

Historian Cassius Dio recorded a revealing event from the life of
Hadrian, the Roman Emperor from ad 117-138: “Once, when a woman made a
request of [Hadrian] as he passed by on a journey, he at first said to
her, ‘I haven’t time,’ but afterwards, when she cried out, ‘Cease,
then, being emperor,’ he turned about and granted her a hearing.”

How often we say or hear, “Not now, I’m busy” or “I’m sorry, but I
just don’t have time.” Yet, our heavenly Father, the Master and
Creator of everything, always has time for us. The psalmist wrote:
“The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to
their cry. . . . The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears, and
delivers them out of all their troubles” (Ps. 34:15-17).

God is not like the emperor or a busy executive who tries to avoid
interruption. Instead, the Father’s joy is to listen and respond to
His children. “The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, and
saves such as have a contrite spirit” (v.18).

Hadrian’s afterthought was, “I must take time for my subjects.” God’s
first thought is, “I always have time for those who come to Me.”
Whenever we need to talk, the Lord is ready to listen.

I love to dwell upon the thought That Jesus cares for me; It matters
not what life may bring— He loves me tenderly. —Adams

God is never too busy to listen to His children.
