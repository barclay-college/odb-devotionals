The Professor’s Confession

This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for
us.
1 John 3:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 3:11–18

Horrified by his students’ poor writing habits, renowned author and
college professor David Foster Wallace considered how he might improve
their skills. That’s when a startling question confronted him. The
professor had to ask himself why a student would listen to someone “as
smug, narrow, self-righteous, [and] condescending” as he was. He knew
he had a problem with pride.

That professor could and did change, but he could never become one of
his students. Yet when Jesus came to Earth, He showed us what humility
looks like by becoming one of us. Stepping across all kinds of
boundaries, Jesus made Himself at home everywhere by serving,
teaching, and doing the will of His Father.

Even as He was being crucified, Jesus prayed for forgiveness for His
executioners (Luke 23:34). Straining for every anguished breath, He
still granted eternal life to a criminal dying with Him (vv. 42–43).

Why would Jesus do that? Why would He serve people like us to the very
end? The apostle John gets to the point. Out of love! He writes, “This
is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us.”
Then he drives that point home. “And we ought to lay down our lives
for our brothers and sisters” (1 John 3:16).

Jesus showed us that His love eradicates our pride, our smugness, our
condescension. And He did it in the most powerful way possible. He
gave His life.

Reflect & Pray

Father, we are so prone to look down on each other. Please forgive us.
Give us the heart of love Your Son showed to us.

Jesus loved us by serving.
