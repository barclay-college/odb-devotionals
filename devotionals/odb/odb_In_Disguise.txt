In Disguise

Oh, how great is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who
fear You. —
Psalm 31:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 45:4-8

In the weeks after my husband survived a heart attack, we often
thanked God for sparing his life. I was asked many times during the
next few months how I was doing. My answer was often a simple one:
“Blessed. I feel blessed.”

Blessings, however, come in different sizes and shapes. In fact, we
don’t always recognize them. Even when we are doing everything we
think God wants us to do, we may still experience suffering. We are
sometimes surprised that God does not answer the way we want or that
His timing appears to be tardy.

We see this in Joseph’s life. From a human perspective, we would think
that God had forgotten all about him. For more than a decade, Joseph
experienced suffering. He was tossed in a pit, sold into slavery,
falsely accused, unjustly put in prison. Finally, however, God’s
faithfulness to him became evident to all as he was lifted up as a
ruler of Egypt and saved many people from famine (Gen. 37–46). C. S.
Lewis wrote: “When we lose one blessing, another is often most
unexpectedly given in its place.”

God had always had His hand of blessing on Joseph, as He does for all
who trust Him. “Oh, how great is Your goodness” (Ps. 31:19).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You love us with an extravagant love, but so often we don’t
trust You in the crisis. Help us to learn and appreciate that You have
everything we need—and so much more.

True happiness is knowing that God is good.
