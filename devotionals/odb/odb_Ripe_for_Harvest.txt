Ripe for Harvest

Open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
John 4:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 4:35–38

In late summer, we went for a walk in the New Forest in England and
had fun picking the blackberries that grew in the wild while watching
the horses frolicking nearby. As I enjoyed the bounty of the sweet
fruit planted by others perhaps many years before, I thought of
Jesus’s words to His disciples: “I sent you to reap what you have not
worked for” (John 4:38).

I love the generosity of God’s kingdom reflected in those words. He
lets us enjoy the fruits of someone else’s labors, such as when we
share our love for Jesus with a friend whose family—unbeknown to
us—has been praying for her for years. I also love the implied limits
of Jesus’s words, for we may plant seeds that we will never harvest
but someone else may. Therefore, we can rest in the tasks before us,
not being hoodwinked into thinking that we are responsible for the
outcomes. God’s work, after all, doesn’t depend on us. He has all of
the resources for a bountiful harvest, and we are privileged to play a
role in it.

I wonder what fields ready for harvest are before you? Before me? May
we heed Jesus’s loving instruction: “Open your eyes and look at the
fields!” (v. 35).

Creator God, thank You for Your great generosity in entrusting us to
do Your work. May I be alert to the opportunities to share Your good
news.

We can reap what others have sown.
