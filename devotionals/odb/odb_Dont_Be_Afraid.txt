Don’t Be Afraid!

The kingdom of God has come near.
Mark 1:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:42–52

Nearly every time an angel appears in the Bible, the first words he
says are “Don’t be afraid!” Little wonder. When the supernatural makes
contact with planet Earth, it usually leaves the human observers flat
on their faces in fear. But Luke tells of God making an appearance in
a form that doesn’t frighten. In Jesus, born with the animals and laid
in a feeding trough, God takes an approach that we need not fear. What
could be less scary than a newborn baby?

On Earth Jesus is both God and man. As God, He can work miracles,
forgive sins, conquer death, and predict the future. But for Jews
accustomed to images of God as a bright cloud or pillar of fire, Jesus
also causes much confusion. How could a baby in Bethlehem, a
carpenter’s son, a man from Nazareth, be the Messiah from God?

Why does God take on human form? The scene of twelve-year-old Jesus
debating rabbis in the temple gives one clue. “Everyone who heard him
was amazed at his understanding and his answers,” Luke tells us
(2:47). For the first time, ordinary people could hold a conversation
with God in visible form.

Jesus can talk to anyone—His parents, a rabbi, a poor widow—without
first having to announce, “Don’t be afraid!” In Jesus, God draws near.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, we pause at Christmas to remember how Your Son came
to us in the form of a helpless baby . . . and we worship in amazement
and wonder that God came near to us.

Jesus was God and man in one person, that God and man might be happy
together again. George Whitefield
