Paranoia In Reverse

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because
fear involves torment. —
1 John 4:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:1-6,17-19

I remember watching television news reports in 1991 as the nonviolent
revolution took place in the streets of Moscow. Russians who had grown
up in totalitarianism suddenly declared, “We will act as if we are
free,” taking to the streets and staring down tanks. The contrast
between the faces of the leaders inside and the masses outside showed
who was really afraid, and who was really free.

Watching the newsreels from Red Square on Finnish television, I came
up with a new definition of faith: paranoia in reverse. A truly
paranoid person organizes his or her life around a common perspective
of fear. Anything that happens feeds that fear.

Faith works in reverse. A faithful person organizes his or her life
around a common perspective of trust, not fear. Despite the apparent
chaos of the present moment, God does reign. Regardless of how I may
feel, I truly matter to a God of love.

What could happen if we in God’s kingdom truly acted as if the words
of the apostle John were literally true: “He who is in you is greater
than he who is in the world” (1 John 4:4). What if we really started
living as if the most-repeated prayer in Christendom has actually been
answered—that God’s will be done on earth as it is in heaven?

Reflect & Pray

Far, far above thy thought His counsel shall appear, When fully He the
work hath wrought That caused thy needless fear. —Gerhardt

Feeding your faith helps starve your fears.
