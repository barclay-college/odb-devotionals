Nowhere To Hide

To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood. —
Revelation 1:5

Today's Scripture: Genesis 3:6-13,22-24

I smelled something burning, so I hurried to the kitchen. Nothing was
on the stove or in the oven. I followed my nose through the house.
From room to room I went, eventually ending up downstairs. My nose led
me to my office and then to my desk. I peeked beneath it and there,
peering back at me with big eyes pleading for help, was Maggie, our
dog, our very “fragrant” dog. What smelled like something burning when
I was upstairs, now had the distinct odor of skunk. Maggie had gone to
the farthest corner of our house to escape the foul smell, but she
couldn’t get away from herself.

Maggie’s dilemma brought to mind the many times I have tried to run
away from unpleasant circumstances only to discover that the problem
was not the situation I was in but me. Since Adam and Eve hid after
sinning (Gen. 3:8), we’ve all followed their example. We run away from
situations thinking we can escape the unpleasantness—only to discover
that the unpleasantness is us.

The only way to escape ourselves is to stop hiding, acknowledge our
waywardness, and let Jesus wash us clean (Rev. 1:5). I am grateful
that when we do sin, Jesus is willing to give us a brand-new start.

Reflect & Pray

From the wondrous cross on Calvary Flows the stream that still avails,
Cleansing hearts and bringing victory Through that love which never
fails. —Elliott

Sin’s contamination requires the Savior’s cleansing.
