Listeners and Doers

Look after orphans and widows in their distress.
James 1:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 1:22–27

The phone rang in the night for my husband, a minister. One of the
prayer warriors in our church, a woman in her seventies who lived
alone, was being taken to the hospital. She was so ill that she was no
longer eating or drinking, nor could she see or walk. Not knowing if
she would live or die, we asked God for His help and mercy, feeling
particularly concerned for her welfare. The church sprang into action
with a round-the-clock schedule of visitors who not only ministered to
her but showed Christian love to the other patients, visitors, and
medical staff.

James’s letter to the early Jewish Christians encouraged the church to
care for the needy. James wanted the believers to go beyond just
listening to the Word of God and to put their beliefs into action
(1:22–25). By citing the need to care for orphans and widows (v. 27),
he named a vulnerable group, for in the ancient world the family would
have been responsible for their care.

How do we respond to those who are at risk in our church and
community? Do we see caring for the widows and orphans as a vital part
of the exercise of our faith? May God open our eyes to the
opportunities to serve people in need everywhere.

Reflect & Pray

Father God, Your heart beats for the vulnerable and for those who are
alone. Help us to love Your people as You love them, for we are made
in Your image.

True faith demands not only our words, but our actions.
