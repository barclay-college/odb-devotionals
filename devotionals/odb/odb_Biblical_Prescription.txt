Biblical Prescription

A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the
bones.
Proverbs 17:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 17:19–22

Greg and Elizabeth have a regular “Joke Night” with their four school-
age children. Each child brings several jokes they’ve read or heard
(or made up themselves!) during the week to tell at the dinner table.
This tradition has created joyful memories of fun shared around the
table. Greg and Elizabeth even noticed the laughter was healthy for
their children, lifting their spirits on difficult days.

The benefit of joyful conversation around the dinner table was
observed by C. S. Lewis, who wrote, “The sun looks down on nothing
half so good as a household laughing together over a meal.”

The wisdom of fostering a joyful heart is found in Proverbs 17:22,
where we read, “A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed
spirit dries up the bones.” The proverb offers a “prescription” to
stimulate health and healing—allowing joy to fill our hearts, a
medicine that costs little and yields great results.

We all need this biblical prescription. When we bring joy into our
conversations, it can put a disagreement into perspective. It can help
us to experience peace, even after a stressful test at school or a
difficult day at work. Laughter among family and friends can create a
safe place where we both know and feel that we’re loved.

Do you need to incorporate more laughter into your life as “good
medicine” for your spirit? Remember, you have encouragement from
Scripture to cultivate a cheerful heart.
