Pointing Fingers

There is none who does good, no, not one. —
Psalm 14:3

Today's Scripture: Psalm 14

An employee in the bill-collection department of a large store gave me
an insight into human nature. He told me that he repeatedly gets the
following response from customers who are delinquent in paying their
bills: “I know you must have others who owe a lot more than I do. Get
off my back, will you!”

The employee then told me, “They miss the point entirely. Sure, there
are a lot of others who owe more. But somehow I have to tell them in a
nice way, ‘Look, what somebody else owes isn’t the issue. Our records
say that your account is overdue!'”

The tendency of sinful man has always been to shift attention from
himself by pointing the finger at others. Religious people excuse
their inconsistencies by referring to the “pagans” around them. And
the “pagans” try to sidestep the issue by talking about the
hypocrisies of the religious. But God is not fooled by finger-
pointers.

When someone else appears to be a greater sinner than we are, it’s
just an illusion. The sooner we realize that no one owes more to God
than we do, the more likely we are to receive His free forgiveness. He
extends His pardon only to those who humbly acknowledge that they are
hopelessly in debt.

Reflect & Pray

My sin, O Lord, defies Your Word, It scorns Your holy name; I will not
make excuse for wrong— Christ's blood is what I claim. —D. De Haan

One sin rationalized becomes two.
