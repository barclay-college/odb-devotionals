Imaginary Friend?

Abraham believed God . . . and he was called the friend of God. —
James 2:23

Today's Scripture: Romans 1:18-25

Not long ago, I heard about this billboard along the highway: “God is
an imaginary friend—choose reality. It will be better for all of us.”

Obviously, the bold statement compares Christians to children whose
vivid imaginations invent a make-believe companion. But is that what
God is—an imaginary friend?

Actually, the evidence favors His reality. Ponder these ideas: The
creation of the world shows there is a Designer behind the universe
(Rom. 1:18-20). The conscience indicates a Lawgiver behind each
human’s sense of right and wrong (Rom. 2:14-15). The creativity we
express in music and art reflect the same attribute that the Creator
possesses (Ex. 35:31-32). Christ reveals what God is like in human
form (Heb. 1:1-4). And the communion or fellowship of the Spirit in
the Christian heart manifests the reality of God (Gal. 5:22-23).

The Bible tells us there will be those who deny the reality of God (2
Peter 3:4-6). But James reminds us of His reality and how an Old
Testament believer befriended Him: “‘Abraham believed God, and it was
accounted to him for righteousness.’ And he was called the friend of
God” (James 2:23). Have you met the redeeming God? He gave His Son to
become your real, eternal Friend (John 15:15).

I’ve found a Friend, O such a Friend! He loved me ere I knew Him; He
drew me with the cords of love, And thus He bound me to Him. —Small

The dearest friend on earth is but a mere shadow compared to Jesus.
