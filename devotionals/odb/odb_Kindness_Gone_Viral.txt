Kindness Gone Viral

Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of
such is the kingdom of God. —
Mark 10:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 10:13-16

News of a simple act of kindness on a New York subway has gone around
the world. A young man, head covered by a hooded sweatshirt, fell
asleep on the shoulder of an older passenger. When someone else
offered to wake the young rider, the older man quietly said, “He must
have had a long day. Let him sleep. We’ve all been there.” Then he let
the tired fellow rider sleep on his shoulder for the better part of
the next hour, until the older man gently eased away to get up for his
stop. In the meantime, another passenger snapped a photograph and
posted it on social media, and it went viral.

The man’s kindness seems to resonate with what we all long for—the
kindness that reflects the heart of God. We see this gentleness in
Jesus when His friends tried to protect Him from the noise and bother
of little children. Instead, Jesus insisted on taking the little ones
in His arms and blessing them (Mark 10:16). In the process, He invited
all of us to trust Him like a little child (vv.13-16).

Jesus lets us know that all of us are safe in His presence. Whether
awake or asleep, we can lean on Him. When we’re exhausted, He provides
a safe place for us to rest.

Reflect & Pray

Under His wings, I am safely abiding, Though the night deepens and
tempests are wild; Still I can trust Him—I know He will keep me, He
has redeemed me and I am His child. —Cushing

God is a safe resting place.
