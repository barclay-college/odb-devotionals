Blessed Forgetfulness

I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved. —
John 10:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 10:1-10

My office is downstairs, but I make frequent trips upstairs to various
rooms in my house for one thing or another. Unfortunately, by the time
I get upstairs I often forget what I was planning to do when I got
there. Researcher Gabriel Radvansky has come up with an explanation
for this phenomenon. He proposes that a doorway serves as an “event
boundary.”

After conducting three different experiments, he theorized that a
doorway signals the brain that the information held in memory can be
filed away—but it’s frustrating when I’m standing there trying to
remember why I came upstairs. However, forgetfulness can be a
blessing. When I shut the door to our bedroom at night and settle down
to sleep, it’s a blessing to forget the worries of the day.

When I think of the fact that Jesus called Himself “the door” (John
10:7,9), I gain a new appreciation for this metaphor. When sheep enter
the pen, they enter a safe place protected from thieves and predators.
For believers, the Great Shepherd is the door between us and our
enemies. Once we enter the sheepfold, we can “forget” all dangers and
threats. We can enjoy divine forgetfulness and rest in the protection
of the Great Shepherd.

Thank You, Father, for the peace of mind that comes from knowing You
are standing watch over the events of our lives. Help us to rest
securely in Your protection.

Christ is the door that keeps us in and keeps the dangers out.
