Enough

They ate and had some left over, according to the word of the Lord.
2 Kings 4:44

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 4:42–44

When my husband and I were first asked to host a small group in our
home, my immediate reaction was to decline. I felt inadequate. We
didn’t have seats for everyone; our home was small and couldn’t hold
many people. I didn’t know whether we had the skills to facilitate the
discussion. I worried that I’d be asked to prepare food, something for
which I lacked both passion and funds. I didn’t feel like we had
“enough” to do it. I didn’t feel I was “enough” to do it. But we
wanted to give to God and our community, so despite our fears, we
agreed. Over the next five years we found great joy in welcoming the
group into our living room.

I observe similar reluctance and doubt in the man who brought bread to
God’s servant, Elisha. Elisha had instructed him to give it to the
people, but the man questioned whether twenty loaves could feed so
many—one hundred men. He seems to have been tempted to withhold the
food because—in his human understanding—it wouldn’t be sufficient. Yet
it was more than enough (2 Kings 4:44), because God took his gift,
given in obedience, and made it enough.

When we feel inadequate, or think what we have to offer isn’t
sufficient, let’s remember that God asks us to give what we have in
faithful obedience. He is the one who makes it “enough.”

Reflect & Pray

Lord, when I fear what I have to give is insufficient, help me to give
to You anyway and trust You to make it “enough.”

An offering given in faithful obedience is just right.
