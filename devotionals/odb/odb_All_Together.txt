All Together

Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth; break forth in song,
rejoice, and sing praises. —
Psalm 98:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 98:1-9

For years my wife’s piano and my banjo had an uncomfortable and
infrequent relationship. Then, after Janet bought me a new guitar for
my birthday, she expressed an interest in learning to play my old
guitar. She is a very capable musician, and soon we were, together,
playing songs of praise on our guitars. I like to think that a new
kind of “praise connection” has filled our home.

When the psalmist was inspired to write of worshiping God, he began
with this exhortation: “Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth;
break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises” (Ps. 98:4). He called
for us to “sing to the Lord” with instruments such as harps and
trumpets and horns (vv.5-6). He commanded all of the earth to “shout
joyfully to the Lord” (v.4). In this mighty orchestration of praise,
the rolling sea is to roar with exaltation, the rivers are to clap
their hands, and the hills are to sing out in joy. All the human race
and creation are together called to praise the Lord in “a new song” of
praise, “for He has done marvelous things” (v.1).

Today let your heart connect with others and God’s creation in singing
songs of praise to the mighty Creator and Redeemer.

Reflect & Pray

Let us celebrate together, Lift our voice in one accord, Singing of
God’s grace and mercy And the goodness of the Lord. —Sper

God can use ordinary instruments to produce a concert of praise.
