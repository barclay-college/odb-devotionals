Speak Up

Having arrested [Jesus], they led Him and brought Him into the high
priest’s house. But Peter followed at a distance. —
Luke 22:54

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 22:54-65

When I hear stories about young people who have been bullied, I notice
there are always at least two levels of hurt. The first and most
obvious comes from the mean-spirited nature of those actually doing
the bullying. That’s terrible on its own. But there’s another, deeper
hurt that may end up being even more damaging than the first: The
silence of everyone else.

It hurts the one being bullied because they’re stunned that no one
will help. That often makes bullies more brazen, leading them to
intensify their meanness. Worse, it heightens the embarrassment, false
shame, and loneliness of the victim. So it is imperative to speak up
for others and speak out against the behavior (see Prov. 31:8a).

Jesus knows precisely what it feels like to be bullied and to be left
to suffer completely alone. Without cause, He was arrested, beaten,
and mocked (Luke 22:63-65). Matthew 26:56 says that “all the disciples
forsook Him and fled.” Peter, one of His closest friends, even denied
three times that he knew Him (Luke 22:61). While others may not
understand fully, Jesus does.

When we see others being hurt, we can ask Him for the courage to speak
up.

Reflect & Pray

Make us brave, Lord, for those who need our courage. Help us to speak
for others and show them that You know their hurt and loneliness.

The voice of a courageous Christian is an echo of the voice of God.
