A Singer’s Heart

Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; let us shout aloud to the Rock
of our salvation.
Psalm 95:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 95:1–7

The praise song drifted downstairs . . . at 6:33 on a Saturday
morning. I didn’t think anyone else was awake, but my youngest
daughter’s scratchy voice proved me wrong. She was barely conscious,
but there was already a song on her lips.

My youngest is a singer. In fact, she can’t not sing. She sings when
she wakes up. When she goes to school. When she goes to bed. She was
born with a song in her heart—and most of the time, her songs focus on
Jesus. She’ll praise God anytime, anywhere.

I love the simplicity, devotion, and earnestness of my daughter’s
voice. Her spontaneous and joyful songs echo invitations to praise God
found throughout Scripture. In Psalm 95, we read, “Come let us sing
for joy to the L ord ; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our
salvation” (v. 1). Reading further, we learn that this praise flows
from an understanding of who He is (“For the L ord is the great God,
the great King above all gods,” v. 3)—and whose we are (“For he is our
God and we are the people of his pasture,” v. 7).

For my daughter, those truths are her first thought in the morning. By
God’s grace, this little worshiper offers us a profound reminder of
the joy of singing to Him.

Reflect & Pray

What prompts you to praise God for His faithfulness to you? What songs
help you to remember and focus on His character and goodness?

God, thank You for who You are and for what You’ve done for me—and for
all Your people—by inviting us to be sheep in Your pasture. Let today
be filled with my songs of praise for Your goodness.
