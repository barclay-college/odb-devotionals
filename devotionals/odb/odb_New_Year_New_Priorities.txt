New Year, New Priorities

Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.
Ecclesiastes 9:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 9:4–12

I’ve always wanted to learn how to play the cello. But I’ve never
found the time to enroll in a class. Or, perhaps more accurately, I
haven’t made the time for it. I had thought that in heaven I could
probably master that instrument. In the meantime, I wanted to focus on
using my time in the particular ways God has called me to serve Him
now.

Life is short, and we often feel the pressure to make the most of our
time on Earth before it slips away. But what does that really mean?

As King Solomon contemplated the meaning of life, he offered two
recommendations. First, we’re to live in the most meaningful way we
can, which includes fully enjoying the good things God allows us to
experience in life, such as food and drink (Ecclesiastes 9:7),
clothing and perfume (v. 8 nlt ), marriage (v. 9), and all of God’s
good gifts—which might include learning how to play the cello!

His second recommendation was diligent work (v. 10). Life is full of
opportunities, and there is always more work to be done. We’re to take
advantage of the opportunities God gives us, seeking His wisdom on how
to prioritize work and play in a way that uses our gifting to serve
Him.

Life is a wonderful gift from the Lord. We honor Him when we take
pleasure both in His daily blessings and in meaningful service.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for this life You’ve given me. Help me to live this
new year for You, enjoying Your blessings and fulfilling Your
purposes.

We can both enjoy God’s blessings and be a blessing to others.
