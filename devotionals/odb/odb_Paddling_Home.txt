Paddling Home

One thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is
ahead.
Philippians 3:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:12-16

I like Reepicheep, C. S. Lewis’ tough little talking mouse in the
Chronicles of Narnia series. Determined to reach the “utter East” and
join the great lion Aslan [symbolic of Christ], Reepicheep declares
his resolve: “While I may, I sail East in Dawn Treader. When she fails
me, I row East in my coracle [small boat]. When that sinks, I shall
paddle East with my four paws. Then, when I can swim no longer, if I
have not yet reached Aslan’s Country, there shall I sink with my nose
to the sunrise.”

Paul put it another way: “I press on toward the goal” (Phil. 3:14).
His goal was to be like Jesus. Nothing else mattered. He admitted that
he had much ground to cover but he would not give up until he attained
that to which Jesus had called him.

None of us are what we should be, but we can, like the apostle, press
and pray toward that goal. Like Paul we will always say, “I have not
yet arrived.” Nevertheless, despite weakness, failure, and weariness
we must press on (v. 12). But everything depends on God. Without Him
we can do nothing!

God is with you, calling you onward. Keep paddling!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help us learn that we do not press on toward our goal by our own
effort but through prayer and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Apart
from You, we can do nothing. Work in us today, we pray.

God provides the power we need to persevere.
