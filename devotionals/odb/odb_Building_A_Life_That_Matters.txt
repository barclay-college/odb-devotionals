Building A Life That Matters

I have laid the foundation . . . . But let each one take heed how he
builds on it. —
1 Corinthians 3:10

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 3:9-17

My grandkids love to play with Legos. These small colorful building
blocks capture their imagination for building forts, planes, houses,
or whatever the instructions may call for.

Emptying the contents of the box onto the floor, my grandchildren
begin to put the pieces together. But soon they think they don’t need
to consult the directions. This eventually leads to a point when they
realize that building according to their own instincts has resulted in
a bad outcome. So, they break it apart and start over again—but this
time they have a keen sense of how important the directions are.

Do you need the pieces of your life broken apart and put back together
according to God’s directions? If you have Jesus Christ as your
foundation, begin to follow His blueprint for living. Paul wrote, “Let
each one take heed how he builds” on the foundation (1 Cor. 3:10-11).
What is the blueprint? Value others above yourself by humbly serving
them (Phil. 2:3-4), give generously of your resources to those in need
(James 2:14-17), respond with love to those who have wronged you (Rom.
12:14-21). These are just a few of the pieces that God wants you to
put together to build a life that is worthy of being His temple (1
Cor. 3:16).

Reflect & Pray

Because of the grace and forgiveness that You have shown me, Lord, I
want to live a life that’s worthy of knowing You. Help me to follow
Your plans that You’ve laid out in the Scriptures. Amen.

The Bible is the Christian’s blueprint for life.
