Does It Spark Joy?

Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true . . . noble . . .
right . . . pure . . . lovely . . . admirable—if anything is excellent
or praiseworthy—think about such things.
Philippians 4:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:4–9

A young Japanese woman’s book on decluttering and organizing has sold
two million copies worldwide. The heart of Marie Kondo’s message is
helping people get rid of unneeded things in their homes and
closets—things that weigh them down. “Hold up each item,” she says,
“and ask, ‘Does it spark joy?’” If the answer is yes, keep it. If the
answer is no, then give it away.

The apostle Paul urged the Christians in Philippi to pursue joy in
their relationship with Christ. “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will
say it again: Rejoice!” (Phil. 4:4). Instead of a life cluttered with
anxiety, he urged them to pray about everything and let God’s peace
guard their hearts and minds in Christ (vv. 6–7).

Looking at our everyday tasks and responsibilities, we see that not
all of them are enjoyable. But we can ask, “How can this spark joy in
God’s heart and in my own?” A change in why we do things can bring a
transformation in the way we feel about them.

“Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true . . . noble . . .
right . . . pure . . . lovely . . . admirable—if anything is excellent
or praiseworthy—think about such things” (v. 8).

Paul’s parting words are food for thought and a recipe for joy.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, show me how You want to spark joy in the tasks I face today.

A focus on the Lord is the beginning of joy.
