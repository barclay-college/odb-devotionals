River Tree

They will be like a tree planted by the water.
Jeremiah 17:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 17:5–10

This was a tree to be envied. Growing on riverfront property, it
didn’t have to worry about weather reports, withering temperatures, or
an uncertain future. Nourished and cooled by the river, it spent its
days lifting its branches to the sun, holding the earth with its
roots, cleaning the air with its leaves, and offering shade to all who
needed refuge from the sun.

By contrast, the prophet Jeremiah pointed to a shrub (Jer. 17:6). When
the rains stopped and the summer sun turned the ground to dust, the
bush shriveled into itself, offering no shade or fruit to anyone.

Why would the prophet compare a flourishing tree to a withering bush?
He wanted his people to recall what had happened since their
miraculous rescue from the slave yards of Egypt. For forty years in a
wilderness, they lived like a tree planted by a river (2:4–6). Yet in
the prosperity of their promised land they had forgotten their own
story; they were relying on themselves and on gods of their own making
(vv. 7–8), even to the point of going back to Egypt looking for help
(42:14).

So God, through Jeremiah, lovingly urged the forgetful children of
Israel, and He urges us, to hope and trust in the Lord and to be like
the tree—not the bush.

Reflect & Pray

Father, in so many ways You have taught us that You alone can be
trusted—even when it seems like You are nowhere to be seen. Please
help us to recall today what You have already shown us along the way.

Let’s remember in good times what we have learned in days of trouble.
