Not Abandoned

I will not forget you. See, I have inscribed you on the palms of My
hands. —
Isaiah 49:15-16

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 49:13-16

Years ago, while my husband and I were visiting the Smithsonian Air
and Space Museum in Washington, DC, we noticed a baby stroller by
itself with no one nearby. We assumed that the parents had left it
there because it was too bulky and were now carrying their child. But
as we approached, we saw a sleeping baby inside. Where was a parent .
. . a sibling . . . a babysitter? We hung around for quite some time
before hailing a museum official. No one had shown up to claim that
precious child! The last we saw of him, he was being wheeled away to a
safe place.

That experience made me think about what it’s like to be abandoned.
It’s an overwhelming feeling that no one cares anything about you.
It’s a real and excruciatingly painful feeling. But even though people
may abandon us, God’s love and presence is assured. The Lord promises
that He will never leave us (Deut. 31:8). He will be with us wherever
we go, “always, even to the end of the age” (Matt. 28:20).

The Lord will never falter in His commitment to His children. Even if
we have been abandoned by others, we can find confidence in His
promise that nothing will ever “separate us from [His] love” (Rom.
8:35-39).

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for Your never-failing presence in every aspect of
our lives. We count on Your promise never to abandon us. Please teach
us to rest in that truth. In Jesus’ name, amen.

Confidence in God’s presence is our comfort.
