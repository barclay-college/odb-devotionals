He Never Sleeps

He will not allow your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not
slumber. —
Psalm 121:3

Today's Scripture: Psalm 121

Giraffes have the shortest sleep cycle of any mammal. They sleep only
between 10 minutes and 2 hours in a 24-hour period and average just
1.9 hours of sleep per day. Seemingly always awake, the giraffe has
nothing much in common with most humans in that regard. If we had so
little sleep, it would probably mean we had some form of insomnia. But
for giraffes, it’s not a sleep disorder that keeps them awake. It’s
just the way God has made them.

If you think 1.9 hours a day is not much sleep, consider this fact
about the Creator of our tall animal friends: Our heavenly Father
never sleeps.

Describing God’s continual concern for us, the psalmist declares, “He
who keeps you will not slumber” (Ps. 121:3). In the context of this
psalm, the writer makes it clear that God’s sleepless vigilance is for
our good. Verse 5 says, “The Lord is your keeper.” God keeps us,
protects us, and cares for us—with no need for refreshing. Our
Protector is constantly seeking our good. As one song puts it: “He
never sleeps, He never slumbers. He watches me both night and day.”

Are you facing difficulties? Turn to the One who never sleeps. Each
second of each day, let Him “preserve your going out and your coming
in” (v.8).
