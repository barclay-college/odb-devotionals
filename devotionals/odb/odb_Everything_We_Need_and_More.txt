Everything We Need and More

[God’s] divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life.
2 Peter 1:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Peter 1:1–10

In a field on the English countryside, G. K. Chesterton stood up from
where he had been sitting and exploded with laughter. His outburst was
so sudden and so loud that the cows could not take their eyes off him.

Just minutes before, the Christian writer and apologist had been
miserable. That afternoon he had been wandering the hills, sketching
pictures on brown paper using colored chalks. But he was dismayed to
discover he had no white chalk, which he considered to be essential to
his artwork. Soon, though, he began to laugh when he realized that the
ground beneath him was porous limestone—the earth’s equivalent of
white chalk. He broke off a piece and resumed drawing.

Like Chesterton, who realized he “was sitting on an immense warehouse
of white chalk,” believers have God’s unlimited spiritual resources
within reach at all times. “His divine power has given us everything
we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him” (2 Peter 1:3).

Maybe you feel you are lacking some important element necessary for
godliness such as faith, grace, or wisdom. If you know Christ, you
have everything you need and more. Through Jesus, you have access to
the Father—the one who graciously provides believers with all things.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, forgive me for overlooking Your power and trying to live in
my own strength. I can’t do it. Thank You for providing everything I
need.

God has unlimited power.
