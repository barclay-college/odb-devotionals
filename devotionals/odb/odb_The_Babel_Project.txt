The Babel Project

Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.
Psalm 127:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 11:1-9

Two workmen were asked what they were building together. One said he
was building a garage. The other replied that he was building a
cathedral. A day later there was only one man laying bricks. When
asked where the second was, the first replied, “Oh, he got fired. He
insisted on building a cathedral instead of a garage.”

Something similar happened on the ancient worksite of Babel. A group
of people decided they would build a city and a tower that would reach
to the heavens and unite their world (Gen. 11:4). But God didn’t want
them working on a grand, self-centered plan based on the idea that
they could rise to the heights of God and solve all of their own
problems. So He came down, stopped the project, scattered the people
“over all the earth,” and gave them different languages (vv. 8-9).

God wanted people to see Him as the solution to their problems, and He
revealed His plan for them to Abraham (12:1-3). Through the faith of
Abraham and his descendants, He would show the world how to look for a
city “whose architect and builder is God” (Heb. 11:8-10).

Our faith does not rise out of our own dreams and solutions. The
foundation of faith is in God alone and what He can do in and through
us.

Reflect & Pray

Dear heavenly Father, forgive me for focusing on my own schemes and
dreams. Help me to look to You for guidance in all that I do.

God wants to do what only He can do in and for us.
