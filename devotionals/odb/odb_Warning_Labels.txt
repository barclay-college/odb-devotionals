Warning Labels

Reproofs of instruction are the way of life. —
Proverbs 6:23

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 6:16-22

Warning labels are everywhere today—from new appliances to toys. Even
medications include pages of small print about all that could possibly
go wrong.

God’s Word is filled with warning labels, alerting us to things that
are harmful to our spiritual health. When we read, “These six things
the Lord hates, yes, seven are an abomination to Him” (Prov. 6:16), it
grabs our attention like a flashing warning signal. The list that
follows (vv.17-19) warns against destructive tendencies like pride and
dishonesty—sins that damage earthly relationships and grieve our
heavenly Father. The text further states that “reproofs of instruction
are the way of life” (v.23). In other words, God’s warnings aren’t
meant to take the fun out of life, but rather to protect and preserve
life.

I’ll always remember as a child standing with my friend Bobby outside
after church and watching him suddenly run toward the busy street. I
heard his mother yell, “Stop!” It was a warning to protect him, not to
hinder his freedom.

Too often we’ve ignored God’s warnings to stop running in the wrong
direction and suffered the consequences. Let’s remember that there’s
freedom in heeding His warnings. They’re for our good.

Lord, thank You for the warnings in Your Word that are intended to
protect and preserve my life. Help me to heed Your reproofs and
instruction that I may live a life that is pleasing to You.

God’s Word is full of loving warnings to protect and preserve us.
