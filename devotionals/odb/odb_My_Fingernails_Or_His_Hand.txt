My Fingernails Or His Hand?

The Lord upholds him with His hand. —
Psalm 37:24

Today's Scripture: Psalm 37:23-26

Tough times can cause us to get our perspective turned around. I was
reminded of this recently as I talked to a fellow-griever—another
parent who, like Sue and me, lost a teenage daughter to death suddenly
and without warning.

She told me she had been missing her daughter terribly, and she told
God she felt as if she were hanging on by her fingernails. Then she
felt as if God reminded her that His hand of protection was there to
hold her up—that she could let go, and He would catch her.

That’s a better perspective, isn’t it? This picture reminds us that
when troubles come and we feel least able to hold on to our faith,
it’s not up to us. It’s up to God to support us with His mighty hand.

Psalm 37:23-24 says: “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord
. . . . Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the
Lord upholds him with His hand.” And Psalm 63:8 tells us: “My soul
follows close behind You; Your right hand upholds me.”

In tough times, we can become so preoccupied with our role in
“clinging to God” that we forget about His promised protection. It’s
not our fingernails that sustain us—it’s His loving, upholding hand.

Reflect & Pray

God’s hand that holds the ocean’s depths Can hold my small affairs;
His hand that guides the universe, Can carry all my cares. —Anon.

No one is more secure than the one who is held in God’s hand.
