God with Skin On

Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
Romans 12:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 12:9–18

My husband left for a month-long trip, and almost immediately I was
overwhelmed by the needs of my job, our house, and our children. A
writing deadline loomed. The lawn mower broke. My children were on
school break and bored. How would I take care of all of these things
on my own?

I soon realized I wasn’t on my own. Friends from church showed up to
help. Josh came over to fix my lawn mower. John brought me lunch.
Cassidy helped with the laundry. Abi invited my kids over to play with
hers so I could get my work done. God worked through each of these
friends to provide for me. They were a living picture of the kind of
community Paul describes in Romans 12. They loved sincerely (v. 9),
considered the needs of others rather than just their own (v. 10),
shared with me when I was in need, and showed hospitality (v. 13).

Because of the love my friends showed to me, I remained “joyful in
hope” and “patient in affliction” (v. 12), even the mild affliction of
solo parenting for a month. My brothers and sisters in Christ became
what one friend calls “God with skin on” for me. They showed me the
kind of sincere love we ought to show to everyone, especially those in
our community of faith (Galatians 6:10). I hope to be more like them.
