Better By Far

I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far.
Philippians 1:23

Today's Scripture: Philippians 1:12–26

A siren wailed outside a little boy’s house. Unfamiliar with the
sound, he asked his mother what it was. She explained that it was
meant to alert people of a dangerous storm. She said that if people
did not take cover, they might die as a result of the tornado. The boy
replied, “Mommy, why is that a bad thing? If we die, don’t we meet
Jesus?”

Little children don’t always understand what it means to die. But
Paul, who had a lifetime of experience, wrote something similar: “I
desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far” (Phil.
1:23). The apostle was under house arrest at the time, but his
statement wasn’t fueled by despair. He was rejoicing because his
suffering was causing the gospel to spread (vv. 12–14).

So why would Paul be torn between a desire for life and death? Because
to go on living would mean “fruitful labor.” But if he died he knew he
would enjoy a special kind of closeness with Christ. To be absent from
our bodies is to be home with the Lord (2 Cor. 5:6–8).

People who believe in the saving power of Jesus’s death and
resurrection will be with Him forever. It’s been said, “All’s well
that ends in heaven.” Whether we live or die, we win. “For to me, to
live is Christ and to die is gain” (Phil. 1:21).
