Parallel Universes

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!
—
Luke 2:14

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:1-7

Every so often I catch myself wondering about the whole grand scheme
of faith. I stand in an airport, for example, watching important-
looking people in business suits, briefcases clutched to their sides,
as they pause at an espresso bar before scurrying off to another
concourse. Do any of them ever think about God? I wonder.

Christians share an odd belief in parallel universes. One universe
consists of glass and steel and wool clothes and leather briefcases
and the smell of freshly ground coffee. The other consists of angels
and spiritual forces and somewhere-out-there places called heaven and
hell. We palpably inhabit the material world; it takes faith to
consider oneself a citizen of the other, invisible world.

Christmas turns the tables and hints at the struggle involved when the
Lord of both worlds descends to live by the rules of the one. In
Bethlehem, the two worlds came together, realigned. What Jesus went on
to accomplish on planet Earth made it possible for God someday to
resolve all disharmonies in both worlds. No wonder a choir of angels
broke out in spontaneous song, disturbing not only a few shepherds but
the entire universe (Luke 2:13-14).

Reflect & Pray

Once from the realms of infinite glory, Down to the depths of our ruin
and loss, Jesus came, seeking—O Love’s sweet story— Came to the
manger, the shame, and the cross. —Strickland

The key word of Christmas is “Immanuel”— God with us!
