A Lesson In Worry

Lord, how they have increased who trouble me! —
Psalm 3:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 3

My friend handed me a tall glass of water and told me to hold it. The
longer I held it, the heavier it felt. Finally my hand grew tired, and
I had to put the glass down. “I’ve learned that worry can be like
holding that glass,” she said. “The longer I worry about something,
the more my fears weigh me down.”

King David knew about fear. His whole life had been turned upside
down. His son Absalom had stolen the allegiance of the nation of
Israel from him and was attempting to take the throne for himself.
David didn’t know who was loyal to him and who was against him. His
only option seemed to be to run. He said to his servants, “Make haste
to depart, lest [Absalom] overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon
us” (2 Sam. 15:14).

In a psalm that David may have written while he was fleeing for his
life, he wrote: “I cried to the Lord with my voice, and He heard me
from His holy hill” (Ps. 3:4). In the midst of his fear, David looked
to the Lord. God showed him grace and restored him to the throne.

There are plenty of worries that can weigh us down. But as we release
them into God’s strong hands, He will help us through our trials.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, that we do not have to be weighed down by worry. Help
us to place our concerns in Your care so that we do not fear tomorrow.

Worry is a burden that God never meant for us to bear.
