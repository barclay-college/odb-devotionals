Communion On The Moon

If I ascend into heaven, You are there. —
Psalm 139:8

Today's Scripture: Psalm 139:1-12

Apollo 11 landed on the surface of the moon on Sunday, July 20, 1969.
Most of us are familiar with Armstrong’s historic statement as he
stepped onto the moon’s surface: “That’s one small step for a man; one
giant leap for mankind.” But few know about the first meal eaten
there.

Buzz Aldrin had brought aboard the spacecraft a tiny communion kit
provided by his church. Aldrin sent a radio broadcast to earth asking
listeners to contemplate the events of that day and to give thanks.

Then, in radio blackout for privacy, Aldrin poured wine into a silver
chalice. He read, “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides
in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit” (John 15:5). Silently, he gave
thanks and partook of the bread and cup.

God is everywhere, and our worship should reflect this reality. In
Psalm 139 we are told that wherever we go, God is intimately present
with us. Buzz Aldrin celebrated that experience on the surface of the
moon. Thousands of miles from earth, he took time to commune with the
One who created, redeemed, and fellowshiped with him.

Are you far from home? Do you feel as if you’re on a mountaintop or in
a dark valley? No matter what your situation, God’s fellowship is only
a prayer away.
