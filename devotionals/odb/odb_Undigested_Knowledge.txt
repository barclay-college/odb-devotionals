Undigested Knowledge

If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
John 8:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 8:39-47

In his book on language, British diplomat Lancelot Oliphant
(1881–1965) observed that many students give correct answers on tests
but fail to put those lessons into practice. “Such undigested
knowledge is of little use,” declared Oliphant.

Author Barnabas Piper noticed a parallel in his own life: “I thought I
was close to God because I knew all the answers,” he said, “but I had
fooled myself into thinking that was the same as relationship with
Jesus.”

At the temple one day, Jesus encountered people who thought they had
all the right answers. They were proudly proclaiming their status as
Abraham’s descendants yet refused to believe in God’s Son.

“If you were Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then you would do what
Abraham did” (John 8:39). And what was that? Abraham “believed the
Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness” (Gen. 15:6). Still,
Jesus’ hearers refused to believe. “The only Father we have is God
himself,” they said (John 8:41). Jesus replied, “Whoever belongs to
God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not
belong to God” (v. 47).

Piper recalls how things “fell apart” for him before he “encountered
God’s grace and the person of Jesus in a profound way.” When we allow
God’s truth to transform our lives, we gain much more than the right
answer. We introduce the world to Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You that You receive anyone who turns to You in faith.

Faith is not accepting the fact of God but of receiving the life of
God.
