Money Talk

Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor
to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God. —
1 Timothy 6:17

Today's Scripture: 1 Timothy 6:6-12

Marilyn and Steven had been married just a few years, and money was
tight. But as she looked at their threadbare bedspread, she wanted to
replace it. So she decided she would buy a new one with a credit
card—hoping to somehow find the money to pay it off.

Her devotional reading for the day surprised her when it pointed her
to Proverbs 22:27, “If you lack the means to pay, your very bed will
be snatched from under you” (niv). Marilyn decided not to go into debt
for a new bedspread that day.

Decisions about the way we spend our money are a personal matter
between us and the Lord and can be difficult to make. But God hasn’t
left us without help. He tells us: “Honor the Lord with your
possessions” (Prov. 3:9), and “You cannot serve both God and Money”
(Matt. 6:24 niv).

With such truths in mind, we look further in His Word for help to use
money wisely. We find this: “Beware of covetousness” (Luke 12:15).
Another says, “The borrower is servant to the lender” (Prov. 22:7).
And in 1 Timothy we read, be “ready to give, willing to share” (6:18).

Money is a big issue. God, who provides for all our needs, can show us
how to use it to bring Him honor.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, sometimes money and finances are overwhelming. It’s hard to know
what decisions to make, so please lead me and give the wisdom to use
my finances in a way that pleases You.

Never let gold become your god.
