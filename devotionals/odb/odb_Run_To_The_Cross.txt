Run To The Cross

It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. —
Hebrews 10:31

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 10:28-39

Whenever a tsunami warning is given on the northern coastline of Maui,
Hawaii, the people living in Hana rush up the side of a mountain to a
high place of safety. Nearby is a tall wooden cross that was placed
there many years ago. For their physical safety, people run to the
area where the cross is located.

In a similar way, all of us need a place of spiritual safety. Why?
Because the Lord gives us these warnings in His Word: “All have sinned
and fall short of the glory of God” and “the wages of sin is death”
(Rom. 3:23; 6:23). Hebrews 9:27 states: “It is appointed for men to
die once, but after this the judgment.” We might not like to think
about what the consequences of our sin will be as we face a holy God,
but it’s a serious thing “to fall into the hands of the living God”
(10:31).

The good news is that out of love for us, the Father has provided a
place of safety! He sent His Son Jesus to die so we wouldn’t have to
be separated from Him forever (Rom. 5:8-10; Col. 1:19-22).

Because of Jesus Christ’s death on the cross and His resurrection from
the dead, that place of safety is available. Have you run to the
cross?

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, The emblem of suffering
and shame; And I love that old cross where the dearest and best For a
world of lost sinners was slain. —Bennard

To escape sin’s curse, run to the cross.
