Wounds from a Friend

Wounds from a friend can be trusted.
Proverbs 27:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 27:5–10

Charles Lowery complained to his friend about lower back pain. He was
seeking a sympathetic ear, but what he got was an honest assessment.
His friend told him, “I don’t think your back pain is your problem;
it’s your stomach. Your stomach is so big it’s pulling on your back.”

In his column for REV! Magazine, Charles shared that he resisted the
temptation to be offended. He lost the weight and his back problem
went away. Charles recognized that “Better is open rebuke than hidden
love. Wounds from a friend can be trusted” (Prov. 27:5–6).

The trouble is that so often we would rather be ruined by praise than
saved by criticism, for truth hurts. It bruises our ego, makes us
uncomfortable, and calls for change.

True friends don’t find pleasure in hurting us. Rather, they love us
too much to deceive us. They are people who, with loving courage,
point out what we may already know but find hard to truly accept and
live by. They tell us not only what we like to hear but also what we
need to hear.

Solomon honored such friendship in his proverbs. Jesus went further—He
endured the wounds of our rejection not only to tell us the truth
about ourselves but to show us how much we are loved.

Reflect & Pray

Think of a time when a friend said something honest that caused you
pain. Did it benefit you? Is it wise to accept everything our friends
tell us?

A friend is one who can tell you the truth in love.
