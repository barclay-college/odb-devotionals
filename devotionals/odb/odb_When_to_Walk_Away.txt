When to Walk Away

God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can
bear.
1 Corinthians 10:13

Today's Scripture: Genesis 39:1-12

When my father became a Christian in his old age, he fascinated me
with his plan for overcoming temptation. Sometimes he just walked
away! For example, whenever a disagreement between him and a neighbor
began to degenerate into a quarrel, my father just walked away for a
time rather than be tempted to advance the quarrel.

One day he met with some friends who ordered pito (a locally brewed
alcoholic beer). My father had formerly struggled with alcohol and had
decided he was better off without it. So he simply stood up, said his
goodbyes, and left the gathering of old friends for another day.

In Genesis, we read how Potiphar’s wife tempted Joseph. He immediately
recognized that giving in would cause him to “sin against God,” so he
fled (Gen. 39:9-12).

Temptation knocks often at our door. Sometimes it comes from our own
desires, other times through the situations and people we encounter.
As Paul told the Corinthians, “No temptation has overtaken you except
what is common to mankind.” But he also wrote, “God is faithful; he
will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are
tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it” (1
Cor. 10:13).

The “way out” may include removing the objects of temptation or
fleeing from them. Our best course of action may be to simply walk
away.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please give me the wisdom and strength to know when to walk away
from situations and people that tempt me to do wrong.

Every temptation is an opportunity to flee to God.
