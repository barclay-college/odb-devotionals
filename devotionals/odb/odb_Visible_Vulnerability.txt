Visible Vulnerability

Be patient, bearing with one another in love.
Ephesians 4:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:2–6

As I ventured out several weeks after shoulder surgery, I was fearful.
I had become comfortable using my arm sling, but both my surgeon and
physical therapist now told me to stop wearing it. That’s when I saw
this statement: “At this stage, sling wear is discouraged except as a
visible sign of vulnerability in an uncontrolled environment.”

Ah, that was it! I feared the enthusiastic person who might give me a
bear hug or the unaware friend who might bump me accidentally. I was
hiding behind my flimsy baby-blue sling because I feared being hurt.

Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable can be scary. We want to be loved
and accepted for who we are, but we fear that if people truly knew us,
they would reject us and we could get hurt. What if they found out we
are not smart enough . . . kind enough . . . good enough?

But as members of God’s family, we have a responsibility to help each
other grow in faith. We’re told to “encourage one another,” to “build
each other up” (1 Thess. 5:11), and to “be patient, bearing with one
another in love” (Eph. 4:2).

When we are honest and vulnerable with other believers, we may
discover we have mutual struggles battling temptation or learning how
to live obediently. But most of all, we will share the wonder of God’s
gift of grace in our lives.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, many times my fear of being hurt keeps me from being honest
about my struggles. Help me to remember how much You love me, and help
me to be patient and loving with others.

Being honest about our struggles allows us to help each other.
