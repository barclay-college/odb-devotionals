Borrowed Blessings

The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.
Psalm 24:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Chronicles 29:6–16

As we bowed our heads over lunch, my friend Jeff prayed: “Father,
thank You for letting us breathe Your air and eat Your food.” Jeff had
just been through a difficult job loss, so his heartfelt trust in God
and recognition that everything belongs to Him profoundly moved me. I
found myself thinking: Do I honestly understand that even the most
basic, everyday things in my life are really God’s, and He’s
simply letting me use them?

When King David received offerings from the people of Israel for
building the temple in Jerusalem, he prayed, “But who am I, and who
are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this?
Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from
your hand.” Then he added, “All of it belongs to you” (1 Chronicles
29:14, 16).

Scripture tells us that even “the ability to produce wealth” and earn
a living come from Him (Deuteronomy 8:18). Understanding that all we
have is borrowed encourages us to loosen our grip on the stuff of this
world and live with open hands and hearts—sharing freely because we’re
deeply thankful for the kindnesses we receive daily.

God is a generous giver—so loving that He even gave up His Son “for us
all” (Romans 8:32). Because we have been given so much, may we give
Him our heartfelt thanks for blessings small and large..

Reflect & Pray

What borrowed blessing can you thank God for today? How does it help
to know that every good gift is from Him?

Whatever is ours is God’s.
