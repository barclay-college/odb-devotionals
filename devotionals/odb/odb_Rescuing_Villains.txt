Rescuing Villains

Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent
his angel and rescued his servants!
Daniel 3:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Daniel 3:26–30

The comic book hero is as popular as ever. In 2017 alone, six
superhero movies accounted for more than $4 billion (US) in box office
sales. But why are people so drawn to big action flicks?

Maybe it’s because, in part, such stories resemble God’s Big Story.
There’s a hero, a villain, a people in need of rescue, and plenty of
riveting action.

In this story, the biggest villain is Satan, the enemy of our souls.
But there are lots of “little” villains as well. In the book of
Daniel, for example, one is Nebuchadnezzar, the king of much of the
known world, who decided to kill anyone who didn’t worship his
giant statue (Daniel 3:1–6). When three courageous Jewish officials
refused (vv. 12–18), God dramatically rescued them from a blazing
furnace (vv. 24–27).

But in a surprising twist, we see this villain’s heart begin to
change. In response to this spectacular event, Nebuchadnezzar said,
“Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego” (v. 28).

But then he threatened to kill anyone who defied God (v. 29), not yet
understanding that God didn’t need his help. Nebuchadnezzar would
learn more about God in chapter 4—but that’s another story.

What we see in Nebuchadnezzar isn’t just a villain, but someone on a
spiritual journey. In God’s story of redemption, our hero, Jesus,
reaches out to everyone needing rescue—including the villains among
us.

Reflect & Pray

Who do you know in need of God’s rescue? What can you do to help?

Jesus prayed for those who persecuted Him. We can do the same.
