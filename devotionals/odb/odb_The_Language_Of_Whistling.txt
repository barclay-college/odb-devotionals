The Language Of Whistling

I will whistle for them and gather them, for I will redeem them. —
Zechariah 10:8

Today's Scripture: Zechariah 10:1-8

On La Gomera, one of the smallest of the Canary Islands, a language
that sounds like a bird song is being revived. In a land of deep
valleys and steep ravines, schoolchildren and tourists are learning
how whistling was once used to communicate for distances up to 2
miles. One goat herder who is using this ancient language once again
to communicate with his flock said, “They recognize my whistle as they
recognize my voice.”

The practice of whistling also shows up in the Bible, where God is
described as a shepherd whistling for His sheep. This image could be
what the prophet had in mind when he described how God will one day
whistle to bring a wandering and scattered people back to Himself
(Zech. 10:8).

Many years later Jesus said, “My sheep hear My voice, and I know them,
and they follow Me” (John 10:27). That may be the whistle of a
shepherd. Sheep don’t understand words, but they know the sound that
signals the shepherd’s presence.

Misleading voices and distracting noises still compete for our
attention (cf. Zech. 10:2). Yet God has ways of signaling us, even
without words. By events that can be alarming or encouraging, He
reminds us of His guiding, protecting, and reassuring presence.

Father, it is a noisy world. Thank You for always calling to us above

and follow Your leading.

The call of God can always be heard.
