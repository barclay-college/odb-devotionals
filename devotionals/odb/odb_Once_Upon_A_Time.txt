Once Upon A Time

The Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in
the belly of the fish three days and three nights. —
Jonah 1:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 24:32-44

Some people say that the Bible is just a collection of fairy tales. A
boy slaying a giant. A man swallowed by a big fish. Noah’s boat-
building experience. Even some religious people think that these
events are just nice stories with a good moral.

Jesus Himself, however, spoke of Jonah and the giant fish, and Noah
and the flood, as actual events: “As the days of Noah were, so also
will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the
flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,
until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the
flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son
of Man be” (Matt. 24:37-39). His return will happen when we’re not
expecting it.

Jesus compared Jonah’s 3 days inside the big fish to the 3 days He
would experience in the grave before His resurrection (Matt. 12:40).
And Peter talked about Noah and the flood when he equated it to a
future day when Jesus comes back (2 Peter 2:4-9).

God gave us His Word; it’s a book that is filled with truth—not fairy
tales. And one day, we will live happily ever after with Him when
Jesus comes again and receives His children to Himself.
