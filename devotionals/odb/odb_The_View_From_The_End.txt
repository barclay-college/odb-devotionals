The View From The End

All things work together for good to those who love God. —
Romans 8:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 8:1-3, 11-16

Over the course of one year, Richard LeMieux’s lucrative publishing
business collapsed. Soon, his wealth disappeared, and he became
depressed. Eventually, LeMieux began to abuse alcohol and his family
deserted him. At the lowest point in his life, he was homeless,
broken, and destitute. However, it was during this time that he turned
to God. He later wrote a book about what he learned.

The Israelites learned some valuable spiritual lessons when God
allowed them to endure homelessness, uncertainty, and danger. Their
hardships humbled them (Deut. 8:1-18).

They learned that God would provide for their needs. When they were
hungry, He gave them manna. When they were thirsty, He gave them water
from a rock. God taught them that, despite difficult times, He could
bless them (v.1). Finally, the Israelites learned that adversity is
not a sign of abandonment. Moses reminded them that God had been
leading throughout their 40 years in the wilderness (v.2).

When we encounter desperate times, we can look for the spiritual
lessons embedded in our difficulties—lessons that can help us rely on
the One who causes all things to work together for our good and for
His glory (Rom. 8:28).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, please give me the faith to believe that You can bring good
out of any situation. Help me to see what You want to show me during
adversity.

The clearest view of everything that happens comes from heaven.
