No Peas!

In every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present
your requests to God.
Philippians 4:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 118:1-14

When our kids were young, one of them bluntly said “no” when we passed
him some peas for dinner. To which we replied, “No what?” We hoped he
would say, “No, thank you.” Instead he said, “No peas!” That led to a
discussion about the importance of good manners. In fact, we had
similar discussions on numerous occasions.

Beyond good manners—which are external—our Lord reminds us that we are
to have a heart of gratitude. Scripture contains dozens of reminders
that expressing gratitude is of primary importance in our relationship
with God. Psalm 118 begins and ends with the exhortation to “give
thanks to the Lord” (vv. 1, 29). We are to give thanks when we come
into His presence (100:4). And the requests we bring to Him are to be
wrapped in a spirit of thanksgiving (Phil. 4:6). Such an attitude of
gratitude will help us remember our abundant blessings. Even in the
midst of trouble and despair, God’s presence and love are our constant
companions.

It’s no wonder, then, that the psalmist reminds us to “give thanks to
the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever” (Ps. 118:1).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, Your goodness is enough to make me thankful every day. Teach me
to live with a thankful heart and remind me to regularly thank You for
Your goodness and steadfast love.

It is only with gratitude that life becomes rich.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer
