A Given Name

She will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He
will save His people from their sins. —
Matthew 1:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 1:18-25

Most families have their own family stories. One in our family has to
do with how I got my name. Apparently, when my parents were in the
early days of their marriage, they disagreed about what to name their
first son. Mom wanted a son named after Dad, but Dad wasn’t interested
in naming a son “Junior.” After much discussion, they reached a
compromise, agreeing that only if a son was born on Dad’s birthday
would he be given Dad’s name. Amazingly, I was born on my dad’s
birthday. So I was given his name with a “Junior” attached to it.

The naming of children is as old as time. As Joseph wrestled with the
news that his fiancée, Mary, was pregnant, the angel brought him
insight from the Father about naming the Baby: “She will bring forth a
Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people
from their sins” (Matt. 1:21). Not only would Jesus be His name, but
it would also explain the reason for His coming into the world: To
take on Himself the punishment we deserve for our sin. His redemptive
purpose behind the manger is wrapped up in the perfectly given Name
above all names.

May our heart’s desire be to live in a way that honors His wonderful
name!
