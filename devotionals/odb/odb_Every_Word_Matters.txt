Every Word Matters

You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it,
that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God. —
Deuteronomy 4:2

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 4:1-10

Kim Peek was a savant (a person with extraordinary memory) who
memorized all of Shakespeare’s plays. During a performance of Twelfth
Night, Peek noticed that the actor had skipped a word from one of the
lines. Peek suddenly stood up and shouted, “Stop!” The actor
apologized and said he didn’t think anyone would mind. Peek replied,
“Shakespeare would.”

Words matter. But especially when they are the very words of God.
Moses warned Israel, “You shall not add to the word which I command
you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord
your God” (Deut. 4:2). Moses often reminded Israel of God’s mercy and
faithfulness to them in the past. But he also stressed the importance
of obedience to God’s commands as they prepared to enter the Promised
Land. He told them that obedience would result in blessings of life
and a rich inheritance (vv.39-40). Every command and regulation
mattered to God. The value His people placed on God’s Word showed
their view of Him.

Today, when we value God’s Word, handle it with great care, and obey
what it says, we give God the reverence He truly deserves.
