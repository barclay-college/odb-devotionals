Help for a Heavy Load

[The men] shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may
not bear it yourself alone. —
Numbers 11:17

Today's Scripture: Numbers 11:4-17

It’s amazing what you can haul with a bicycle. An average adult with a
specialized trailer (and a bit of determination) can use a bicycle to
tow up to 300 pounds at 10 mph. There’s just one problem: Hauling a
heavier load means moving more slowly. A person hauling 600 pounds of
work equipment or personal possessions would only be able to move at a
pace of 8 miles in one hour.

Moses carried another kind of weight in the wilderness—an emotional
weight that kept him at a standstill. The Israelites’ intense craving
for meat instead of manna had reduced them to tears. Hearing their
ongoing lament, an exasperated Moses said to God, “I am not able to
bear all these people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me”
(Num. 11:14).

On his own, Moses lacked the resources necessary to fix the problem.
God responded by telling him to select 70 men to stand with him and
share his load. God told Moses, “[The men] shall bear the burden of
the people with you, that you may not bear it yourself alone” (v. 17).

As followers of Jesus, we don’t have to handle our burdens alone
either. We have Jesus Himself, who is always willing and able to help
us. And He has given us brothers and sisters in Christ to share the
load. When we give Him the things that weigh us down, He gives us
wisdom and support in return.
