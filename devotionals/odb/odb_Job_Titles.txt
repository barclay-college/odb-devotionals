Job Titles

For the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the
faith. —
Ephesians 4:12-13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:11-16

When the British Broadcasting Corporation asked for examples of
important-sounding, obscure, and even bizarre job titles, one writer
offered hers: Underwater Ceramic Technician. She was a dishwasher at a
restaurant. Sometimes titles are used to make a job sound more
important.

When the apostle Paul listed some of God’s gifts to the church in
Ephesians 4:11, he did not intend for these to be understood as high-
sounding job titles. All the parts of the body are necessary for the
body to function properly. No one part is better than another.

What was of primary importance was the purpose of these gifts. They
were “for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for
the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come to . . . the
stature of the fullness of Christ” (vv.12-13).

It matters little what title we hold. What is important is that we
strengthen the faith of God’s people. When we gauge our effectiveness
by the standard that the Bible gives us, it will not matter when we
are moved to another role or no longer hold a specific title. Out of
love for God, we serve to build up fellow believers, and we let God
give His commendation in heaven as He sees fit (Matt. 25:21).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please use me as Your instrument to touch others’ lives. Help me
not to be concerned about what title I hold but instead that my life
might show others Your grace.

God’s gifts to us are not for us but for others.
