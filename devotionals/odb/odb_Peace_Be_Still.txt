Peace, Be Still

He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!”

Mark 4:39

Today's Scripture: Mark 4:35-41

My friend Elouise has a wonderful way of putting life into clever
perspectives. Once when I asked her, “How are you today?” I expected
the usual “fine” response. Instead, she said, “I’ve got to wake Him
up!” When I asked what she meant, she kiddingly exclaimed, “Don’t you
know your Bible?!” Then she explained: “When the disciples faced
trouble, they ran to wake up Jesus. I’m going to run to Him too!”

What do we do when we are stuck in a troubling situation with nowhere
to run? Maybe, like the disciples who were stuck in a life-threatening
storm, we run to Jesus (Mark 4:35-41). Sometimes, however, we may try
to bail ourselves out of trouble by seeking revenge, slandering the
one who has caused our problem, or just cowering fearfully in the
corner as we sink into despair.

We need to learn from the disciples who fled to Jesus as their only
hope. He may not bail us out immediately, but remembering that He is
in our boat makes a difference! Thankfully, He is always with us in
the storms of life, saying things like “Peace, be still!” (v.39). So,
look for Him in your storm and let Him fill you with the peace that
comes from knowing He is near.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, teach us to run to You in the midst of trouble. Forgive us for
trying to bail ourselves out, and lead us to the peace of trusting
Your wisdom and ultimate deliverance. Thank You that You will help us!

Make Jesus your first option when the storms of life threaten you.
