Leading From The Front

He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul; He leads me
in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. —
Psalm 23:2-3

Today's Scripture: Psalm 23

Stephen Ambrose’s book Band of Brothers follows the US Army’s Easy
Company from training in Georgia through the Normandy Invasion of
D-Day (June 6, 1944) and ultimately to the end of World War II in
Europe. For the bulk of that time, Easy Company was led by Richard
Winters. Winters was an especially good officer because he led from
the front. The most commonly heard words from Winters in combat were,
“Follow me!” Other officers may have sought the safety of the rear
areas, but if Winters’ men were going into combat, he was going to
lead them.

Jesus is the one true Leader of His children. He knows what we need
and where we are most vulnerable. His leading is part of what makes
Psalm 23 the most beloved song in the Bible’s hymnal. In verse 2,
David says that the Shepherd “leads me beside the still waters,” and
in verse 3 he adds, “He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His
name’s sake.” These twin ideas reveal why His care is so complete.
Whether it is times of refreshing and strengthening (“still waters”)
or seasons of doing what pleases Him (“paths of righteousness”), we
can follow Him.

As the old song says, “My Lord knows the way through the wilderness;
all I have to do is follow.”
