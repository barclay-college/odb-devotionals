Interrupted Fellowship

My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
Matthew 27:46

Today's Scripture: Matthew 27:32–50

The loud, sorrowful cry pierced the dark afternoon air. I imagine it
drowning out the sound of mourning from friends and loved ones
gathered at Jesus’s feet. It must have overwhelmed the moans of the
dying criminals who flanked Jesus on both sides. And surely startled
all who heard it.

“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” Jesus cried out in agony and in utter
despondency as He hung on that cross of shame on Golgotha (Matthew
27:45–46).

“My God,” He said, “my God, why have you forsaken me?”

I cannot think of more heart-wrenching words. Since eternity, Jesus
had been in perfect fellowship with God the Father. Together they had
created the universe, had fashioned mankind in their image, and
planned salvation. Never in the eons past had they not been in total
fellowship with each other.

And now, as the anguish of the cross continued to bring devastating
pain on Jesus—He for the first time lost the awareness of God’s
presence as He carried the burden of the sins of the world.

It was the only way. Only through this time of interrupted fellowship
could our salvation be provided for. And it was only because Jesus was
willing to experience this sense of being forsaken on the cross that
we humans can gain fellowship with God.

Thank You, Jesus, for experiencing such pain so we could be forgiven.

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, we again stand in awe at Your sacrifice. We kneel in Your
presence and with gratitude acknowledge what You did for us on the
cross. Thank You for making it possible to have fellowship with the
Father forever.

The cross reveals God’s heart for the lost.
