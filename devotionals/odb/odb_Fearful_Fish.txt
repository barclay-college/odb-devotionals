Fearful Fish

The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory. —
John 1:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 1:6-14

Managing a saltwater aquarium, I discovered, is no easy task. I had to
run a portable chemical laboratory to monitor nitrate levels and
ammonia content. I pumped in vitamins and antibiotics and sulfa drugs
and enzymes. I filtered the water through glass fibers and charcoal.

You would think my fish would be grateful. Not so. When my shadow
loomed above the tank to feed them, they dove for cover into the
nearest shell. I was too large for them; my actions incomprehensible.
They did not know that my acts were merciful. To change their
perceptions would require a form of incarnation. I would have to
become a fish and “speak” to them in a language they could understand,
which was impossible for me to do.

According to the Scriptures, God, the Creator of the universe, did
something that seems impossible. He came to earth in human form as a
baby. “The world was made through Him,” says John, “and the world did
not know Him” (John 1:10). So God, who created matter, took shape
within it, as a playwright might become a character within his own
play. God wrote a story, using real characters, on the pages of real
history. “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (v.14).

Reflect & Pray

All praise to Thee, eternal Lord, Clothed in a garb of flesh and
blood; Choosing a manger for a throne, While worlds on worlds are
Thine alone. —Luther

God entered human history to offer us the gift of eternal life.
