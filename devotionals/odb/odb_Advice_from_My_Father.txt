Advice from My Father

Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own
understanding.
Proverbs 3:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 3:1–7

After being laid off from an editorial job, I prayed, asking for God
to help me find a new one. But when weeks went by and nothing came of
my attempts at networking and filling out applications, I began to
pout. “Don’t You know how important it is that I have a job?” I asked
God, my arms folded in protest at my seemingly unanswered prayer.

When I talked to my father, who had often reminded me about believing
God’s promises, about my job situation, he said, “I want you to get to
the point where you trust what God says.”

My father’s advice reminds me of Proverbs 3, which includes wise
advice from a parent to a beloved child. This familiar passage was
especially applicable to my situation: “Trust in the Lord with all
your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways
submit to him, and he will make your paths straight” (Proverbs 3:5–6).
To “make . . . paths straight” means God will guide us toward His
goals for our growth. His ultimate goal is that I become more like
Him.

This does not mean that the paths He chooses will be easy. But I can
choose to trust that His direction and timing are ultimately for my
good.

Are you waiting on God for an answer? Choose to draw near to Him and
trust that He will guide you.
