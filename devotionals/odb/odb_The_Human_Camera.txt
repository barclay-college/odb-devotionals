The Human Camera

The Holy Spirit . . . will . . . bring to your remembrance all things
that I said to you. —
John 14:26

Today's Scripture: 1 John 1:1-5

Steven Wiltshire, who has been called “the human camera,” has the
amazing ability to recall tiny details about anything he has seen and
then reproduce them in drawings. For example, after Steven was flown
over the city of Rome, he was asked to draw the city center on blank
paper. Astonishingly, he accurately reproduced from memory the winding
streets, the buildings, the windows, and other details.

Wiltshire’s memory is remarkable. Yet there’s another kind of memory
that’s even more amazing—and much more vital. Before Jesus’ return to
heaven, He promised His disciples that He would send the Holy Spirit
to give them supernatural memory of what they had experienced: “The
Helper, the Holy Spirit . . . will . . . bring to your remembrance all
things that I said to you” (John 14:26).

The disciples heard Christ’s marvelous teachings. They heard Him
command the blind to see, the deaf to hear, and the dead to be raised.
Yet when the Gospel writers recorded these events, their words were
not the product of a gifted human memory. Their recollections came
from a divine Helper who made sure they compiled a trustworthy record
of Christ’s life.

Trust the Bible with confidence. It was written with guidance from the
“divine camera,” the Holy Spirit.
