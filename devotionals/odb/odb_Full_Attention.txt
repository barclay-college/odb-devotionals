Full Attention

Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances.
1 Thessalonians 5:16–18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:12–28

Technology today seems to demand our constant attention. The modern
“miracle” of the internet gives us the amazing capacity to access
humanity’s collective learning in the palm of our hand. But for many,
such constant access can come at a cost.

Writer Linda Stone has coined the phrase “continual partial attention”
to describe the modern impulse to always need to know what’s happening
“out there,” to make sure we’re not missing anything. If that sounds
like it could produce chronic anxiety, you’re right!

Although the apostle Paul struggled with different reasons for
anxiety, he knew our souls are wired to find peace in God. Which is
why, in a letter to new believers who’d endured persecution (1
Thessalonians 2:14), Paul concluded by urging the believers to
“rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances”
(5:16–18).

Praying “continually” might seem pretty daunting. But then, how often
do we check our phones? What if we instead let that urge be a prompt
to talk to God?

More important, what if we learned to exchange a need to always be in
“the know” for continual, prayerful rest in God’s presence? Through
relying on Christ’s Spirit, we can learn to give our heavenly Father
our continual full attention as we make our way through each day.

Reflect & Pray

How would you say technology impacts your faith, both negatively and
positively? What might help you grow in undivided focus on God?

Father, thank You for inviting us into a relationship with You, one in
which You long to hear from us continually.
