The Path Of Wisdom

In You, O Lord, I hope; You will hear, O Lord my God. —
Psalm 38:15

Today's Scripture: Psalm 38:1-15

Albert Einstein was heard to say, “Only two things are infinite, the
universe and human stupidity, and I’m not sure about the former.”
Sadly, it does seem that far too often there is no limit to the
foolishness we get ourselves into—or the damage we create by our
foolishness and the choices it fosters.

It was in such a season of regret that David poured out his struggle
and complaint to God in Psalm 38. As he recounted his own failings, as
well as the painful consequences he was enduring because of those
failings, the shepherd-king made an insightful comment: “My wounds are
foul and festering because of my foolishness” (v.5). Although the
psalmist does not give us the details of those choices or of his
worsening wounds, one thing is clear—David recognized his own
foolishness as their root cause.

The answer for such destructive foolishness is to embrace the wisdom
of God. Proverbs 9:10 reminds us, “The fear of the Lord is the
beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is
understanding.” Only by allowing God to transform us can we overcome
the foolish decisions that cause so much trouble. With His loving
guidance, we can follow the pathway of godly wisdom.

Reflect & Pray

Loving Father, forgive me for the seemingly limitless capacity I have
to be foolish. Teach me in Your wisdom, so that my life might be
pleasing to You and a blessing to others around me.

God’s wisdom is given to those who humbly ask Him for it.
