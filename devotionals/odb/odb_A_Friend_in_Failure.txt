A Friend in Failure

Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them.
Acts 15:38

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 15:36–16:5

On November 27, 1939, three treasure hunters accompanied by film crews
dug through the asphalt outside of the Hollywood Bowl amphitheater in
Southern California. They were looking for the Cahuenga Pass treasure,
consisting of gold, diamonds, and pearls rumored to have been buried
there seventy-five years earlier.

They never found it. After twenty-four days of digging, they struck a
boulder and stopped. All they accomplished was a nine-foot-wide,
forty-two-foot-deep hole in the ground. They walked away dejected.

To err is human—we all fail sometimes. Scripture tells us that young
Mark walked away from Paul and Barnabas on a missionary trip “and had
not continued with them in the work.” Because of this, “Paul did not
think it wise to take him” on his next trip (Acts 15:38), which
resulted in a strong disagreement with Barnabas. But in spite of his
initial failings, Mark shows up years later in surprising ways. When
Paul was lonely and in prison toward the end of his life, he asked for
Mark and called him “helpful to me in my ministry” (2 Timothy 4:11).
God even inspired Mark to write the gospel that bears his name.

Mark’s life shows us that God won’t leave us to face our errors and
failures alone. We have a Friend who’s greater than every mistake. As
we follow our Savior, He’ll provide the help and strength we need.
