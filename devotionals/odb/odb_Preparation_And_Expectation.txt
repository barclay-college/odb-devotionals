Preparation And Expectation

An angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord
shone around them. —
Luke 2:9

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:8-12; 21:25-28

When our children were young, we observed Advent (the time beginning
on the fourth Sunday before Christmas through Christmas Eve) by making
a wreath and lighting candles each night after supper. We sang a carol
and read a short Bible passage about the birth of Christ. This was a
special time of preparing our hearts to celebrate Christmas.

But Advent is more than that. When Christians first started practicing
it in the fourth century, they viewed it not only as preparation for
celebrating Jesus’ birth but also as a time of looking forward to His
second coming. They found hope and cheer in the sure promise of His
return.

The gospel of Luke describes “the glory of the Lord” that shone around
the shepherds when the angel announced the Savior’s birth (2:9). Luke
also records Jesus’ promise that He will return “with power and great
glory” (21:27). These two events frame the purpose for which the Son
of God came into the world.

In Latin advent means “a coming.” The weeks before Christmas can be a
wonderful season of repentance and expectation as we celebrate our
Lord’s first advent in Bethlehem and anticipate His second advent when
He returns in glory. Christ has come! Christ is coming again!
