Detecting Toxins

There are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of
Christ. —
Galatians 1:7

Today's Scripture: Galatians 1:3-10

San Francisco and New York City are using bluegill fish to check for
the presence of toxins in their water supply, which could be a
possible target for a terrorist attack. A small number of bluegills
are kept in a tank at the bottom of some water treatment plants
because the fish are sensitive to chemical imbalances in their
environment. When a disturbance is present in the water, the bluegills
react against it.

Like these bluegills, Paul wanted the Galatians to beware of and react
against any toxic disturbance in the “true gospel” that was being
preached. The toxin was defined as the false principle that God grants
acceptance to people and considers them righteous on the basis of
their obedience to a set of rules (especially circumcision and dietary
laws). In short, obedience to the law was needed, apart from faith in
Jesus. This false teaching was a toxic disturbance of the truth and
the Galatians were told to react strongly against it. Paul said that
anyone preaching a gospel that is not based on grace through faith in
Christ alone should be accursed (Gal. 1:8-9).

Let’s faithfully study the Scriptures so we can detect the toxins of
false teaching and proclaim the truth of God’s wonderful salvation
through faith in Jesus.
