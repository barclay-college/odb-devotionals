Transforming Power

These words which I command you today shall be in your heart. —
Deuteronomy 6:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 6:4-9

Many people love to play games that test their knowledge. Recently, a
colleague and I were testing a Bible-knowledge game. Since we were
seated in an open area of our office, those nearby could hear our
conversation. Soon questions ranging from Noah’s ark to the woman at
the well were being answered by those within earshot of us. It was a
delight to hear various staff members volunteering responses to Bible
questions.

A knowledge of the Bible is important, but God desires us to be
saturated with His Word and to internalize it so we can grow in our
relationship with Him. The Holy Spirit uses the Word to make us more
like Christ (Eph. 4:20-24). Consider these benefits of internalizing
the Bible: joy and rejoicing (Jer. 15:16); spiritual success (Josh.
1:8); a tool in spiritual warfare (Matt. 4:1-11); correction (2 Tim.
3:15-16); light for our path (Ps. 119:105); wisdom with problem
solving (Prov. 1:1-2); and stimulating faith (Rom. 10:17).

Learning about the Bible just to increase our knowledge can lead to
spiritual pride (1 Cor. 8:1). But allowing the Holy Spirit to
transform us by the Word helps us navigate through life’s twists and
turns and respond in love to God and to each other.

Reflect & Pray

My hunger for the truth He satisfies; Upon the Word, the Living Bread,
I feed: No parching thirst I know, because His grace, A pool of
endless depth, supplies my need. —Sanders

Many books can inform, but only the Bible can transform.
