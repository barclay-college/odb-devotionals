That Famous Smile

The prospect of the righteous is joy.
Proverbs 10:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 28:6–9

After my wife and I had the privilege of visiting the Louvre in Paris,
I called our eleven-year-old granddaughter Addie on the phone. When I
mentioned seeing da Vinci’s famous painting Mona Lisa, Addie asked,
“Is she smiling?”

Isn’t that the big question surrounding this painting? More than 600
years after Leonardo captured this subject in oil, we still don’t know
if the lady was smiling or not. Though enraptured by the painting’s
beauty, we are unsure about Mona Lisa’s demeanor.

The “smile” is part of the intrigue of the painting. But how important
is this anyway? Is smiling something the Bible mentions? In reality,
the word appears less than five times in Scripture, and never as
something we are told to do. However, the Bible does suggest for us an
attitude that leads to smiles—and that is the word joy. Nearly 250
times we read about joy: “My heart leaps for joy,” David says as he
thinks about the Lord (Ps. 28:7). We are to “sing joyfully to the Lord
” (Ps. 33:1); God’s statutes are “the joy of [our] heart” (119:111);
and we are “filled with joy” because “the Lord has done great things
for us” (126:3).

Clearly, the joy God provides through everything He has done for us
can bring a smile to our face.

Reflect & Pray

You are a good Father, dear God, and You do make us smile. You provide
joy that is beyond what anything the world can offer. Help us show
that joy to others by our countenance.

Hope in the heart puts a smile on the face.
