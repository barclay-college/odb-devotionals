The Gift of Peace

You may now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have seen your
salvation.
Luke 2:29–30

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:25–35

“I believe in Jesus and He is my Savior, and I have no fear of death,”
said Barbara Bush, the wife of former US President George H. W. Bush,
to her son before she died. This incredible and confident statement
suggests a strong and deep-rooted faith. She experienced God’s gift of
peace that comes from knowing Jesus, even when faced with death.

Simeon, a resident of Jerusalem during the first century, also
experienced profound peace because of Jesus. Moved by the Holy Spirit,
Simeon went to the temple where Mary and Joseph brought baby Jesus “to
present him to the Lord” (Luke 2:22). Although not much is known about
Simeon, from Luke’s description one can tell he was a special man of
God, just and devout, waiting faithfully for the coming Messiah, and
“the Holy Spirit was on him” (v. 25). Yet Simeon did not experience
shalom (peace), a deep sense of completeness, until he saw Jesus.

While holding Jesus in his arms, Simeon broke into a song of praise,
expressing full satisfaction in God: “You may now dismiss your servant
in peace. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have
prepared in the sight of all nations” (vv. 29–31). He had peace
because he foresaw the future hope of the whole world.

As we celebrate the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, the
promised Savior, may we rejoice in God’s gift of peace.
