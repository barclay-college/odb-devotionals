Apologies

If you . . . remember that your brother has something against you, . .
. first be reconciled to your brother. —
Matthew 5:23-24

Today's Scripture: Matthew 5:21-26

Mark messed up. He arrived an hour late at a restaurant where he was
to meet a friend from church. The friend had already left. Feeling
sorry about his mistake, Mark purchased a gift certificate from the
restaurant and stopped at a local card shop to search for an apology
card. Among hundreds of cards, he was surprised to find only a few
“sorry for my actions” cards in an obscure part of the store. He
purchased one and gave it to his friend who accepted his apology.

Although apology cards may not be popular, apologies are frequently
needed in our relationships. Apologizing is a biblical action. Jesus
instructed His followers to make things right with those we’ve
offended (Matt. 5:23-24; 18:15-20). And the apostle Paul said, “If it
is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all” (Rom.
12:18). Living at peace may require apologies.

Apologies can be hard to make because it takes a spirit of humility to
admit our mistake, which may not come naturally for us. But taking
responsibility for how we were wrong in a situation can bring healing
and restoration to a relationship.

Have you messed up? Swallow your pride and make the first move—even if
you can’t find a card to help you say it.
