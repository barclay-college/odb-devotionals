Our Powerful God

[He] who creates the wind, . . . the Lord God Almighty is his name.
Amos 4:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Amos 4:12–13

One day by the seaside, I delighted in watching some kite surfers as
they bounced along the water, moved by the force of the wind. When one
came to shore, I asked him if the experience was as difficult as it
looked. “No,” he said, “It’s actually easier than regular surfing
because you harness the power of the wind.”

Afterward as I walked by the sea, thinking about the wind’s ability
not only to propel the surfers but also to whip my hair into my face,
I paused to wonder at our God the Creator. As we see in the Old
Testament book of Amos, He who “forms the mountains” and “creates the
wind” can turn “dawn to darkness” (v. 13).

Through this prophet, the Lord reminded His people of His power as He
called them back to Himself. Because they had not obeyed Him, He said
He would reveal Himself to them (v. 13). Although we see His judgment
here, we know from elsewhere in the Bible of His sacrificial love in
sending His Son to save us (see John 3:16).

The power of the wind on this breezy day in the South of England
reminded me of the sheer immensity of the Lord. If you feel the wind
today, why not stop and ponder our all-powerful God?
