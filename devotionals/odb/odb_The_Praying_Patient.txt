The Praying Patient

Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave
me, so that they may be one as we are one.
John 17:11

Today's Scripture: John 17:6–19

The obituary for Alan Nanninga, a man in my city, identified him as
“foremost, a dedicated witness for Christ.” After a description of his
family life and career, the article mentioned nearly a decade of
declining health. It concluded by saying, “His hospital stays . . .
earned him the honorary title of ‘The Praying Patient’” because of his
ministry to other patients. Here was a man who, in his times of
distress, reached out to pray for and with the people in need around
him.

Hours before Judas betrayed Him, Jesus prayed for His disciples. “I
will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world,
and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your
name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one”
(John 17:11). Knowing what was about to happen, Jesus looked beyond
Himself to focus on His followers and friends.

During our times of illness and distress, we long for and need the
prayers of others. How those prayers help and encourage us! But may we
also, like our Lord, lift our eyes to pray for those around us who are
in great need.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, even in our difficult times, may we honor You and encourage
others by praying for those who are suffering today.

Our troubles can fill our prayers with love and empathy for others.
