A Ukrainian Christmas

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!
—
Luke 2:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:6-14

The people of Ukraine include many wonderful elements in their
observance of Christmas. Sometimes wisps of hay are placed on the
dinner table as a reminder of the Bethlehem manger. Another portion of
their celebration echoes the events of the night when the Savior
entered the world. A Christmas prayer is offered and then the father
in the household offers the greeting, “Christ is born!” The family
then responds, “Let us glorify Him!”

These words draw my mind to the appearance of the angels in the sky
over Bethlehem on the night Christ was born. The angel of the Lord
declared, “For there is born to you this day in the city of David a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:11). The heavenly host
responded, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill
toward men!” (v.14).

Those twin messages give such depth of meaning to this wonderful time
of year. The Savior has come bringing forgiveness and hope—and He is
deserving of all the worship we can give Him.

May all who know the wonder of His gift of eternal life join with the
voices of that angelic host declaring, “Glory to God in the highest!”

Reflect & Pray

With th’angelic hosts proclaim, “Christ is born in Bethlehem!” Hark!
the herald angels sing, “Glory to the newborn King!” —Wesley

The spectacular glory of God’s love for us was revealed in the coming
of Jesus.
