An Enduring Happiness

Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days . . . .
Turn from evil and do good.
Psalm 34:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:1–14

Often we hear that happiness comes from doing things our own way.
That, however, is not true. That philosophy leads only to emptiness,
anxiety, and heartache.

Poet W. H. Auden observed people as they attempted to find an escape
in pleasures. He wrote of such people: “Lost in a haunted wood, /
Children afraid of the night / Who have never been happy or good.”

The psalmist David sings of the remedy for our fears and unhappiness.
“I sought the Lord , and he answered me; he delivered me from all my
fears” (Psalm 34:4). Happiness is doing things God’s way, a fact that
can be verified every day. “Those who look to him are radiant,” writes
David (v. 5). Just try it and you’ll see. That’s what he means when he
says, “Taste and see that the Lord is good” (v. 8).

We say, “Seeing is believing.” That’s how we know things in this
world. Show me proof and I’ll believe it. God puts it the other way
around. Believing is seeing. “Taste and then you will see.”

Take the Lord at His word. Do the very next thing He is asking you to
do and you will see. He will give you grace to do the right thing and
more: He will give you Himself—the only source of goodness—and with
it, enduring happiness.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, sometimes we must simply pray: “I believe. Help my unbelief.”
Help us trust You by doing what You have given us to do today.

Happiness is doing the right thing.
