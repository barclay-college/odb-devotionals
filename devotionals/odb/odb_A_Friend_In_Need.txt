A Friend In Need

My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed
and in truth. —
1 John 3:18

Today's Scripture: 1 John 3:11-18

Not long ago my wife, Janet, and I bought a quantity of beef from a
friend who raised cattle on a small farm. It was less expensive than
meat from a grocery store, and we put it in the freezer to use
throughout the coming months.

Then a terrible lightning storm cut power throughout our area. For the
first 24 hours we were confident that the freezer would keep the meat
frozen. But when the second day came with still no word of getting our
power back, we began to be concerned.

We contacted Ted, a member of our Bible-study group, to see if he had
any advice. He canceled an appointment he had and showed up at our
doorstep with a generator to provide power for the freezer. We were
thankful that Ted helped us, and we knew it was because of his love
for Christ.

The old saying “a friend in need is a friend indeed” took on new
meaning for us. John reminds us in 1 John 3:18, “My little children,
let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.”
Sometimes this means inconveniencing ourselves to care for the
interests of others or receiving that help when we ourselves are in
need. After all Christ has done for us, it’s a blessing to be His
hands and feet in loving one another.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for making me a part of Your family by giving Your
Son Jesus for me. Help me to accept the care of others and also to
serve them out of gratitude and out of my love for You.

When we love Christ, we love others.
