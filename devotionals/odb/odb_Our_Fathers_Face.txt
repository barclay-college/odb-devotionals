Our Father’s Face

Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.
Psalm 80:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 80

I remember my father’s face. It was hard to read. He was a kind man,
but stoic and self-contained. As a child, I often searched his face,
looking for a smile or other show of affection. Faces are us. A frown,
a sullen look, a smile, and crinkly eyes reveal what we feel about
others. Our faces are our “tell.”

Asaph, the author of Psalm 80, was distraught and wanted to see the
Lord’s face. He looked north from his vantage point in Jerusalem and
saw Judah’s sister-state, Israel, collapse under the weight of the
Assyrian Empire. With her buffer state gone, Judah was vulnerable to
invasion from all sides—Assyria from the north, Egypt from the south,
and the Arab nations from the east. She was outnumbered and
outmatched.

Asaph gathered up his fears in a prayer, three times repeated (80:3,
7, 19), “Make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.” (Or, in
other words, let me see Your smile.)

It’s good to look away from our fears and search our heavenly Father’s
face. The best way to see God’s face is to look at the cross. The
cross is His “tell” (John 3:16).

So know this: When your Father looks at you, He has a great big smile
on His face. You’re very safe!
