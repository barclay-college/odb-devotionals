Ask The Author

We have the mind of Christ. —
1 Corinthians 2:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 2:9-16

Over the years I’ve been part of various book groups. Typically,
several friends read a book and then we get together to discuss the
ideas the author has put forward. Inevitably, one person will raise a
question that none of us can answer. And then someone will say, “If
only we could ask the author.” A popular new trend in New York City is
making that possible. Some authors, for a hefty fee, are making
themselves available to meet with book clubs.

How different it is for those of us who gather to study the Bible.
Jesus meets with us whenever we get together. No fees. No scheduling
conflicts. No travel expenses. Furthermore, we have the Holy Spirit to
guide our understanding. One of the last promises Jesus made to His
disciples was that God would send the Holy Spirit to teach them (John
14:26).

The Author of the Bible is not limited by time or space. He can meet
with us at any time and any place. So whenever we have a question, we
can ask with the assurance that He will answer—though perhaps not
according to our timetable.

God wants us to have the mind of the Author (1 Cor. 2:16) so that
through the teaching of the Spirit we will comprehend the greatness of
the gift He has freely given us (v.12).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You that You are meeting with me right now. I want to be
taught by You. I don’t want just to have more knowledge about You; I
want to know You in the depths of my heart.

When you open your Bible, ask the Author to open your mind and heart.
