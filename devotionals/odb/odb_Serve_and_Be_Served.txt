Serve and Be Served

You were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.
Philippians 4:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:10–19

Marilyn had been ill for many weeks, and many people had encouraged
her through this difficult time. How will I ever repay all their
kindnesses? she worried. Then one day she read the words of a written
prayer: “Pray that [others] will develop humility, allowing them not
only to serve, but also to be served.” Marilyn suddenly realized there
was no need to balance any scale, but just to be thankful and allow
others to experience the joy of serving.

In Philippians 4, the apostle Paul expressed his gratitude for all
those who shared “in [his] troubles” (v. 14). He depended on people to
support him as he preached and taught the gospel. He understood that
the gifts provided for him when he was in need were simply an
extension of people’s love for God: “[Your gifts] are a fragrant
offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God” (v. 18).

It may not be easy to be the one on the receiving end—especially if
you’ve usually been the first one to help other people. But with
humility, we can allow God to gently care for us by a variety of means
when we need help.

Paul wrote, “My God will meet all your needs” (v. 19). It was
something he had learned during a life of trials. God is faithful and
His provision for us has no limits.
