Black Boxes

These things happened to them as examples, and they were written for
our admonition. —
1 Corinthians 10:11

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 10:1-11

Commercial aircraft carry two flight-data recorders called “black
boxes.” One logs the performance and condition of the aircraft in
flight, and the other records the conversation of the crew with air-
traffic controllers on the ground. These boxes are insulated to
protect against extreme temperatures and are fitted with underwater
locator beacons that emit sounds to the surface. After an airplane
crash, these boxes are retrieved and the data carefully analyzed to
determine the cause of the crash. Air safety experts want to learn
from past mistakes, among other things, so they won’t be repeated.

As Christians, we too should look at mistakes from the past and learn
from them. Paul, for example, alluded to some of the mistakes the
Israelites made in their journey from Egypt to Canaan. He wrote that
because God was not pleased with them, many died in the wilderness (1
Cor. 10:5). Paul went on to explain that “these things happened to
them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us who live at
the end of the age” (v.11 nlt).

The inspired Word of God is written for our instruction for living (2
Tim. 3:16-17). Thank You, Lord, for the guidance of Your Word.

For Your holy Book we thank You; May its message be our guide, May we
understand the wisdom Of the truth Your laws provide. —Carter

God’s warnings are to protect us, not to punish us.
