On The Fringe

God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by
Christ Jesus. —
Philippians 4:19

Today's Scripture: Philippians 4:10-20

When butterflies hatch at Frederik Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, they do so in an indoor tropical paradise perfectly suited
to meet their every need. The temperature is perfect. The humidity is
perfect. The food is a perfect balance of calories and nutrition to
keep them healthy. No need to go elsewhere. Yet some butterflies see
the bright blue sky outside the conservatory and spend their days
fluttering near the glass ceiling far away from the plentiful food
supply.

I want to say to those butterflies, “Don’t you know everything you
need is inside? The outside is cold and harsh, and you will die within
minutes if you get what you are longing to have.”

I wonder if that is the message God has for me. So I ask myself, Do I
look longingly at things that would harm me? Do I use my energy to
gain what I don’t need and shouldn’t have? Do I ignore God’s plentiful
provision because I imagine that something just beyond my reach is
better? Do I spend my time on the fringes of faith?

God supplies all our needs from His riches (Phil. 4:19). So instead of
striving for what we don’t have, may we open our hearts to gratefully
receive everything we’ve already been given by Him.

Reflect & Pray

All that I want is in Jesus; He satisfies, joy He supplies; Life would
be worthless without Him, All things in Jesus I find. —Loes

Our needs will never exhaust God’s supply.
