A Survivor’s Thoughts

I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren.
—
Romans 9:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 9:1-5

After a 71-year-old South Korean woman was rescued during the tragic
sinking of a ferry boat, she struggled with survivor’s guilt. From her
hospital bed she said she couldn’t understand how it could be right
for her to have lived through an accident that had taken the lives of
many who were so much younger. She also regretted not knowing the name
of the young man who had pulled her out of the water after she had
given up hope. Then she added, “I want to buy him a meal at least, or
hold his hand, or give him a hug.”

This woman’s heart for others reminds me of the apostle Paul. He was
so concerned about his neighbors and countrymen that he said he wished
he could trade his own relationship with Christ for their rescue: “I
have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart. For I could wish
that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren” (Rom. 9:2-3).

Paul also expressed a deep sense of personal gratitude. He knew he
didn’t understand the ways and judgments of God (see vv.14-24). So
while doing everything he could to proclaim the gospel to all, he
found peace and joy in trusting the heart of a God who loves the whole
world so much more than we ever could.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, Your ways are so far beyond our comprehension, yet we know
without doubt that You love us. Help us trust Your loving heart with
the things we don’t understand.

Gratitude to God leads to growth in godliness.
