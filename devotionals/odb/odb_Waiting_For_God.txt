Waiting For God

Simeon . . . was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of
Israel. —
Luke 2:25

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:25-35

Author Henri Nouwen has observed that the first pages of Luke’s gospel
are filled with people who were waiting: Zacharias and Elizabeth, Mary
and Joseph, Simeon and Anna were all waiting for the fulfillment of a
promise from God. But instead of passively waiting, they were actively
looking to the Lord each day, what Nouwen calls being “present to the
moment.”

Simeon, for example, was controlled not by hopelessness but by the
Spirit who prompted him to go into the temple. His words of praise
when he saw the child Jesus, the promised Messiah, resound as an
example of patient hope in God: “My eyes have seen Your salvation
which You have prepared before the face of all peoples, a light to
bring revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel”
(Luke 2:30-32).

Many of us find ourselves waiting on God for an answer to a prayer or
the fulfillment of a promise. His word comes to us, just as it did to
those who were swept up in the events that marked the first Christmas:
“Do not be afraid, Zacharias” (1:13); “Do not be afraid, Mary” (1:30);
“Do not be afraid, [shepherds]” (2:10).

As we listen to God in His Word and obey Him, we’ll discover His
goodness and power as we wait.

Reflect & Pray

Perfect submission, all is at rest, I in my Savior am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above, Filled with His goodness, lost in
His love.  —Crosby

Time spent “waiting on God” is never wasted.
