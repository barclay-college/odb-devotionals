Stories of Jesus

Jesus did many other things as well.
John 21:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 1:1–4; John 21:24–25

As a girl I loved to visit my small local library. One day, looking at
the bookshelves holding the young adult section, I reasoned I could
probably read every book. In my enthusiasm I forgot one important
fact—new books were regularly added to the shelves. Although I gave it
a valiant effort, there were simply too many books.

New books continue to fill more and more bookshelves. The apostle John
likely would be amazed with the availability of books today since his
five New Testament books, the gospel of John; 1, 2, and 3 John; and
Revelation, were handwritten on parchment scrolls.

John wrote those books because he felt compelled by the Holy Spirit to
give Christians an eyewitness account of Jesus’s life and ministry (1
John 1:1–4). But John’s writings contained only a small fraction of
all that Jesus did and taught during His ministry. In fact, John said
if everything Jesus did were written down “the whole world could not
contain the books that would be written” (John 21:25 nlt ).

John’s claim remains true today. Despite all the books that have been
written about Jesus, the libraries of the world still cannot contain
every story of His love and grace. We can also celebrate that we have
our own personal stories to share and rejoice that we will be
proclaiming them forever! (Psalm 89:1).

Reflect & Pray

To write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry. Nor could
the scroll contain the whole, though stretched from sky to sky.
