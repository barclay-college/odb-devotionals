Failure To Discipline

No chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful;
nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of
righteousness. —
Hebrews 12:11

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 2:27-36

We live in the woods, so we get very little prolonged sunlight in the
summer. But we love fresh tomatoes, so I decided to try growing them
in pots set in a few sunny spots.

The plants started to grow right away and really fast. I was
thrilled—until I realized that their fast growth was due to their
efforts to reach out to the limited sunlight. By the time I figured
out what was happening, the vines were too heavy to support
themselves. I found some stakes, lifted the vines carefully, and
fastened them in an upright position. Even though I tried to be
gentle, one of the twisted vines broke when I tried to straighten it.

This reminded me that discipline must begin before character is
permanently bent and twisted.

Eli the priest had two sons whom he failed to discipline. When their
wickedness got so bad that he could no longer ignore it, he tried
gentle rebuke (1 Sam. 2:24-25). But it was too late, and God announced
the dire consequences: “I will judge [Eli’s] house forever for the
iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he
did not restrain them” (3:13).

Being straightened out is painful, but being left crooked will
ultimately hurt even more.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, even though it’s painful, we’re thankful that You, in love,
discipline us as Your children. Help us to respond with repentance and
obedience to Your ways. Amen.

God’s love confronts and corrects.
