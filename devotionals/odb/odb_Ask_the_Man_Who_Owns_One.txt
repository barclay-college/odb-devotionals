Ask the Man Who Owns One

Let me tell you what [God] has done for me.
Psalm 66:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 66:1, 8–20

In the early 1900s, the Packard Motor Car Company generated a slogan
to entice buyers. “Ask the man who owns one” became a powerful
tagline, one that contributed to the company’s reputation as
manufacturing the dominant luxury vehicle in that era. What Packard
seemed to understand is that personal testimony is compelling to the
hearer: a friend’s satisfaction with a product is a powerful
endorsement.

Sharing with others our personal experiences of God’s goodness to us
also makes an impact. God invites us to declare our gratitude and joy
not only to Him but also to those around us (Psalm 66:1). The psalmist
eagerly shared in his song the forgiveness God granted him when he
turned from his sins (vv. 18–20).

God has done amazing works in the course of history, such as parting
the waters of the Red Sea (v. 6). He also does amazing work in each of
our personal lives: giving us hope in the midst of suffering, giving
us the Holy Spirit to understand His Word, and providing for our daily
needs. When we share with others our personal experiences of God’s
work in our lives, we’re giving something of much greater value than
an endorsement of a particular purchase—we’re acknowledging God’s
goodness and encouraging one another along the journey of life.
