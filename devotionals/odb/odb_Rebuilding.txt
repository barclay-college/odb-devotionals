Rebuilding

Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be
in disgrace.
Nehemiah 2:17

Today's Scripture: Nehemiah 2:11–18

When Edward Klee returned to Berlin after being away for many years,
the city he remembered and loved was no longer there. It had changed
dramatically, and so had he. Writing in Hemispheres magazine, Klee
said, “Returning to a city you once loved tends to be a hit-or-miss
proposition . . . . It can be a letdown.” Going back to the places of
our past may produce a feeling of sorrow and loss. We are not the same
person we were then, nor is the place that was so significant in our
lives exactly as it was.

Nehemiah had been in exile from the land of Israel for many years when
he learned of the desperate plight of his people and the devastation
in the city of Jerusalem. He received permission from Artaxerxes, the
Persian king, to return and rebuild the walls. After a night
reconnaissance to examine the situation (Neh. 2:13–15), Nehemiah told
the inhabitants of the city, “You see the trouble we are in: Jerusalem
lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us
rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace”
(v. 17).

Nehemiah did not return to reminisce but to rebuild. It’s a powerful
lesson for us as we consider the damaged parts of our past that need
repair. It is our faith in Christ and His power that enables us to
look ahead, move forward, and rebuild.
