The Cross and the Crown

I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will
live, even though they die.
John 11:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 19:21-30

Westminster Abbey in London has a rich historical background. In the
10th century, Benedictine monks began a tradition of daily worship
there that still continues today. The Abbey is also the burial place
of many famous people, and every English monarch since ad 1066 has
been crowned at the Abbey. In fact, 17 of those monarchs are also
buried there—their rule ending where it began.

No matter how grandiose their burial, world rulers rise and fall; they
live and die. But another king, Jesus, though once dead, is no longer
buried. In His first coming, Jesus was crowned with thorns and
crucified as the “king of the Jews” (John 19:3,19). Because Jesus rose
from the dead in victory, we who are believers in Christ have hope
beyond the grave and the assurance that we will live with Him forever.
Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes
in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing
in me will never die” (11:25-26).

We serve a risen King! May we gladly yield to His rule in our lives
now as we look forward to the day when the “Lord God Almighty” will
reign for all eternity (Rev. 19:6).
