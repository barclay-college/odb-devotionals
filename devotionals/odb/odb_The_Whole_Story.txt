The Whole Story

Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached
Jesus to him. —
Acts 8:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 8:26-37

Recently my 5-year-old grandson, Dallas, asked, “Why did Jesus die on
the cross?” So we had a little talk. I explained to him about sin and
Jesus’ willingness to be our sacrifice. Then he ran off to play.

A few minutes later, I overheard him talking to his 5-year-old cousin,
Katie, explaining to her why Jesus died. Katie said to him, “But Jesus
isn’t dead.” Dallas replied, “Yes. He’s dead. Grampy told me. He died
on the cross.”

I realized I hadn’t completed the story. So we had another talk as I
explained to Dallas that Jesus rose from the dead. We went over the
story again until he understood that Jesus is alive today, even though
He did die for us.

What a reminder that people need to hear the whole gospel. When a man
from Ethiopia asked Philip about a portion of Scripture he did not
understand, Philip “opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture,
preached Jesus to him” (Acts 8:35).

Tell others the good news about Jesus: that we are all sinners needing
salvation; that the perfect Son of God died to save us; and that He
rose from the grave, showing His power over death. Jesus, our Savior,
is alive and is offering now to live His life through us.

When someone wants to know about Jesus, let’s make sure to tell the
whole story!

Lord, Your story is amazing. Help us to tell all of it so others can

Jesus said . . . , “I am the resurrection and the life. He who
believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.” John 11:25
