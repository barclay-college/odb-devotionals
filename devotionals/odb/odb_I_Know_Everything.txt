I Know Everything

You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all
my ways.
Psalm 139:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:1–18

Our son and daughter-in-law had an emergency. Our grandson Cameron was
suffering from pneumonia and bronchitis and needed to go to the
hospital. They asked if we could pick up their five-year-old son,
Nathan, from school and take him home. Marlene and I were glad to do
so.

When Nathan got in the car, Marlene asked, “Are you surprised that we
came to get you today?” He responded, “No!” When we asked why not, he
replied, “Because I know everything!”

A five-year-old can claim to know everything, but those of us who are
a bit older know better. We often have more questions than answers. We
wonder about the whys, whens, and hows of life—often forgetting that
though we do not know everything, we know the God who does.

Psalm 139:1 and 3 speak of our all-knowing God’s all-encompassing,
intimate understanding of us. David says, “You have searched me, Lord,
and you know me. . . . You discern my going out and my lying down; you
are familiar with all my ways.” How comforting to know God loves us
perfectly, is fully aware of what we will face today, and He knows how
best to help us in every circumstance of life.

Our knowledge will always be limited, but knowing God is what matters
most. We can trust Him.
