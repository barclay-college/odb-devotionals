In the Garden

My Father, . . . may your will be done.
Matthew 26:42

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 26:36-42

My forefathers were pioneers in Michigan. They cleared the land,
planted crops, and cultivated gardens to raise food for their
families. This agrarian bent has been passed down through the
generations. My dad grew up on a Michigan farm and loved gardening,
which may explain why I love gardening and the smell of fertile soil.
Cultivating plants that bear beautiful flowers and tending roses that
fragrantly grace our yard with beauty are enjoyable pastimes for me.
If it weren’t for the weeds it would be wonderful!

When I have to wrestle with the weeds, I am reminded of the garden of
Eden; it was a perfect garden until Adam and Eve disobeyed God and
thorns and thistles became a reality for them and every gardener since
then (Gen. 3:17-18).

The Bible also mentions another garden—the garden of Gethsemane where
Christ, in deep distress, pleaded with His Father to find another way
to reverse sin’s consequences that were born in Eden. In Gethsemane,
Jesus surrendered to His Father by uttering words of full obedience in
the face of great pain: “Your will be done” (Matt. 26:42).

Because Jesus surrendered in that garden, we now harvest the benefits
of His amazing grace. May this lead us to surrender to His weeding of
sin from our lives.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for the amazing price You paid to free me from sin.
May the reality of the victory You won encourage me to reject the sin
that entangles my ability to be fruitful for You.

Spiritual growth occurs when faith is cultivated.
