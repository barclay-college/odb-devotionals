Marriage God’s Way

A man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and
they shall become one flesh. —
Genesis 2:24

Today's Scripture: Genesis 2:18-25

The movie The Princess Bride has a wedding scene in which the marrying
minister says, “Marriage . . . is what brings us together today.”

Sometimes it is good to remind ourselves of the grand plan for
marriage spelled out in Scripture.

Marriage creates one new family out of two: Adam said, “ ‘This is now
bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh . . . .’ Therefore a man shall
leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife” (Gen. 2:23-24).

It provides a pure outlet for a divinely designed desire: “Because of
sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman
have her own husband” (1 Cor. 7:2).

It forms a mutually helpful team: “The heart of her husband safely
trusts her . . . . She does him good and not evil all the days of her
life” (Prov. 31:11-12).

Marriage God’s way brings a man and a woman together to honor Him and
help society. Celebrate marriage for the ways it brings us together in
God’s name.

Reflect & Pray

If men and women yield to God And of His love partake, The marriage
bond that joins two hearts No power on earth can break. —D. De Haan

God created husband and wife to complement each other.
