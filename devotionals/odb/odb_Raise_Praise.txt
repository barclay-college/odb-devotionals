Raise Praise

Your praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
Psalm 48:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 48

You can generally tell where a map was drawn by what lies in its
middle. We tend to think our home is the center of the world, so we
put a dot in the middle and sketch out from there. Nearby towns might
be fifty miles to the north or half a day’s drive to the south, but
all are described in relation to where we are. The Psalms draw their
“map” from God’s earthly home in the Old Testament, so the center of
biblical geography is Jerusalem.

Psalm 48 is one of many psalms that praise Jerusalem. This “city of
our God, his holy mountain” is “beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of
the whole earth” (vv. 1–2). Because “God is in her citadels,” He
“makes her secure forever” (vv. 3, 8). God’s fame begins in
Jerusalem’s temple and spreads outward to “the ends of the earth” (vv.
9–10).

Unless you’re reading this in Jerusalem, your home is not in the
center of the biblical world. Yet your region matters immensely,
because God will not rest until His praise reaches “to the ends of the
earth” (v. 10). Would you like to be part of the way God reaches His
goal? Worship each week with God’s people, and openly live each day
for His glory. God’s fame extends “to the ends of the earth” when we
devote all that we are and have to Him.
