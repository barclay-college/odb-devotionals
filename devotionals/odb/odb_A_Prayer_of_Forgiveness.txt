A Prayer of Forgiveness

Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who
curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
Luke 6:27–28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 6:27–36

In 1960, six-year-old Ruby Bridges was the first African-American
child to integrate an all-white public elementary school in the
American South. Every day for months, federal marshals escorted Ruby
past a mob of angry parents shouting curses, threats, and insults at
her. Safely inside, she sat in a classroom alone with Barbara Henry,
the only teacher willing to instruct her while parents kept their
children from attending school with Ruby.

Noted child psychiatrist Robert Coles met with Ruby for several months
to help her cope with the fear and stress she experienced. He was
amazed by the prayer Ruby said every day as she walked to school and
back home. “Please, God, forgive them because they don’t know what
they’re doing” (see Luke 23:34).

The words of Jesus spoken from the cross were stronger than the hatred
and insults hurled at Him. In the most agonizing hours of His life,
our Lord demonstrated the radical response He taught His followers:
“Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who
curse you, pray for those who mistreat you . . . . Be merciful, just
as your Father is merciful” (Luke 6:27–28, 36).

This remarkable approach is possible only as we consider the powerful
love Jesus has given us—love stronger than even the deepest hatred.

Ruby Bridges helped show us the way.

Reflect & Pray

Father, You have so graciously forgiven us. Help us today to forgive
others who have wronged us.

Bless those who curse you and pray for those who mistreat you.
