A Faithful Servant

If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so
that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ.
1 Peter 4:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Joshua 14:6-15

Madaleno is a bricklayer. From Monday to Thursday he builds walls and
repairs roofs. He is quiet, reliable, and hardworking. Then from
Friday to Sunday he goes up to the mountains to teach the Word of God.
Madaleno speaks Nahuatl (a Mexican dialect), so he can easily
communicate the good news of Jesus to the people in that region. At
age 70, he still works with his hands building houses, but he also
works to build the family of God.

His life has been threatened several times. He has slept under the
stars and faced death from car accidents and falls. He has been kicked
out of towns. But he thinks that God has called him to do what he
does, and he serves happily. Believing that people need to know the
Lord, he relies on God for the strength he needs.

Madaleno’s faithfulness reminds me of the faithfulness of Caleb and
Joshua, two of the men Moses sent to explore the Promised Land and
report back to the Israelites (Num. 13; Josh. 14:6-13). Their
companions were afraid of the people who lived there, but Caleb and
Joshua trusted in God and believed He would help them conquer the
land.

The work entrusted to us may be different than Madaleno’s or Caleb’s
and Joshua’s. But our confidence can be the same. In reaching out to
others, we rely not on ourselves but on the strength of our God.
