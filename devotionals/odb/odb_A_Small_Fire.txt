A Small Fire

The tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.
Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
James 3:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 3:3–12

It was a Sunday night in September and most people were sleeping when
a small fire broke out in Thomas Farriner’s bakery on Pudding Lane.
Soon the flames spread from house to house and London was engulfed in
the Great Fire of 1666. Over 70,000 people were left homeless by the
blaze that leveled four-fifths of the city. So much destruction from
such a small fire!

The Bible warns us of another small but destructive fire. James was
concerned about lives and relationships, not buildings, when he wrote,
“The tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.
Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark” (James
3:5).

But our words can also be constructive. Proverbs 16:24 reminds us,
“Gracious words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the
bones.” The apostle Paul says, “Let your conversation be always full
of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer
everyone” (Col. 4:6). As salt flavors our food, grace flavors our
words for building up others.

Through the help of the Holy Spirit our words can encourage people who
are hurting, who want to grow in their faith, or who need to come to
the Savior. Our words can put out fires instead of starting them.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I can always use help with the way I talk. For this day, help me
to speak words of hope and encouragement to build up others.

What will our words be like today?
