Broken Bones

Make me hear joy and gladness, that the bones You have broken may
rejoice. —
Psalm 51:8

Today's Scripture: Psalm 51:1-13

Years ago, I played collegiate soccer as a goalkeeper. It was more fun
than I can describe here, but all that fun came at a hefty price—one I
continue to pay today. Being a goalie means that you are constantly
throwing your body into harm’s way to prevent the other team from
scoring, often resulting in injuries. During the course of one season,
I suffered a broken leg, several cracked ribs, a separated shoulder,
and a concussion! Today, especially on cold days, I am visited by
painful reminders of those broken bones.

David also had reminders of broken bones, but his injuries were
spiritual, not physical. After David’s moral collapse involving an
affair with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband, God firmly
disciplined him. But then David turned to Him in repentance and
prayed, “Make me hear joy and gladness, that the bones You have broken
may rejoice” (Ps. 51:8).

God’s chastening was so crushing that David felt like his bones were
broken. Yet he trusted that the God of grace could both repair his
brokenness and rekindle his joy. In our own failure and sin, it’s a
comfort to know that God loves us enough to pursue and restore us with
His loving discipline.

Reflect & Pray

Father, open my eyes to see my failings, open my heart to receive Your
discipline, and open my will to embrace Your loving purposes. When I
fall, I pray that You will make me whole and restore my joy in You.

God’s hand of discipline is a hand of love.
