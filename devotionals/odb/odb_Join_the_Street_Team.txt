Join the Street Team

I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.
Mark 2:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 2:13–17

City health workers in San Francisco are taking medical care to the
streets to supply the homeless who are suffering from opioid addiction
with medicine to treat their addiction. The program began in response
to the rising number of homeless who are injecting. Customarily,
doctors wait for patients to come to a clinic. By taking medical care
to the afflicted instead, patients don’t have to overcome the
challenges of transportation or needing to remember the appointment.

The health workers’ willingness to go to those in need of care reminds
me of the way Jesus has come to us in our need. In His ministry, Jesus
sought out those who the religious elite were quick to ignore: He ate
with “sinners and tax collectors” (Mark 2:16). When asked why He would
do that, Jesus replied, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but
the sick” (v. 17). He went on to say that His intention was to call
sinners, not the righteous, into relationship with Him.

When we realize that we’re all “sick” and in need of a doctor (Romans
3:10), we can better appreciate Jesus’s willingness to eat with the
“sinners and tax collectors”—us. In turn, like the health care workers
in San Francisco, Jesus appointed us as His “street team” to take His
saving message to others in need.

How did Jesus seek you out? To whom can you take the medicine of
Jesus?

Thank You, Jesus, for meeting me in my condition.
