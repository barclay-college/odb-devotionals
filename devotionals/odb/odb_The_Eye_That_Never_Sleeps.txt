The Eye That Never Sleeps

In my distress I cried to the Lord, and He heard me. —
Psalm 120:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 121

Detective Allan Pinkerton became famous in the mid-1800s by solving a
series of train robberies and foiling a plot to assassinate Abraham
Lincoln as he traveled to his first inauguration. As one of the first
agencies of its kind in the US, the Pinkerton National Detective
Agency gained even more prominence because of its logo of a wide-open
eye with the caption, “We Never Sleep.”

There is no better feeling than knowing you are protected and secure.
You feel peaceful when the doors are locked and all is quiet as you
drift off to sleep at night. You feel safe. But many lie awake in
their beds with fearful thoughts of the present or dread of the
future. Some are afraid of commotion outside or of a spouse who has
been violent. Some cannot rest because of worry over a rebellious
child. Others are anxiously listening to make sure a seriously ill
child is still breathing.

These are the times when our loving God encourages us to cry out to
Him, to the One who will neither “slumber nor sleep” (Ps. 121:4).
Psalm 34:15 reminds us that “the eyes of the Lord are on the
righteous, and His ears are open to their cry.”

Pinkerton may have been the original “private eye,” but the One who
really has the eye that never sleeps is listening to the cries of “the
righteous” (Ps. 34:17).

Reflect & Pray

Before you sleep, just gently lay Every troubled thought away; Drop
your burden and your care In the quiet arms of prayer. —Anon.

We can sleep in peace when we remember that God is awake.
