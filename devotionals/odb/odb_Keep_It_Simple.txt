Keep It Simple

We are not writing any other things to you than what you [can] read or
understand. —
2 Corinthians 1:13

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 1:12-14

James Madison, fourth president of the United States, was instrumental
in the drafting of the US constitution. He warned against creating
laws “so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that
they cannot be understood.” Based on some of the complicated
government forms I’ve read, that’s advice that still needs to be
heeded a little more often!

Sometimes when sharing the gospel, we make it more complicated than it
needs to be. We can be glad that the Bible presents the good news of
salvation in clear, easily understood language. Jesus said to
Nicodemus, an educated Pharisee, that “God so loved the world that He
gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not
perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). He later said, “I am
the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except
through Me” (14:6). The apostle Paul said it in straightforward
language to the jailor in Philippi who asked how to be saved: “Believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31).

God’s precious love story is simple. He sent His Son to rescue us from
sin and death. Wonderful news that even children can understand.

Reflect & Pray

Tell me the story of Jesus, Write on my heart every word; Tell me the
story most precious, Sweetest that ever was heard. —Crosby

Through faith in Christ, we receive God’s pardon and escape sin’s
penalty.
