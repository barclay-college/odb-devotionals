Jesus Reached Out

Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him.
Matthew 14:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 14:22–33

Sometimes life gets busy—classes are hard, work is exhausting, the
bathroom needs to be cleaned, and a coffee date is on the day’s
schedule. It gets to the point where I force myself to read the Bible
for a few minutes a day and tell myself I’ll spend more time with God
next week. But it doesn’t take long before I’m distracted, drowning in
the day’s tasks, and forget to ask God for help of any kind.

When Peter was walking on water toward Jesus, he quickly became
distracted by the wind and waves. Like me, he began to sink (Matthew
14:29–30). But as soon as Peter cried out, “immediately Jesus reached
out his hand and caught him” (vv. 30–31).

I often feel as if I have to make it up to God after being so busy and
distracted that I lose sight of Him. But that’s not how God works. As
soon as we turn to Him for help, Jesus reaches out without hesitation.

When we’re unsettled by the chaos of life, it’s easy to forget that
God is standing in the middle of the storm with us. Jesus asked Peter,
“Why did you doubt?” (v. 31). No matter what we’re going through, He
is there. He is here. Next to us at that moment, in this moment, ready
to reach out and rescue us.

Lord, help me to turn to You in the midst of my busyness and life’s
distractions. Thank You for always being here, ready to catch me.

God is waiting for us to turn to Him so He can reach out and help.
