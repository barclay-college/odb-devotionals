Just What I Need

We can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves
receive from God.
2 Corinthians 1:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 1:3-7

As I stood in the back of the room at a senior citizens’ center in
Palmer, Alaska, listening to my daughter’s high school choir sing “It
Is Well with My Soul,” I wondered why she, the choir director, had
chosen that song. It had been played at her sister Melissa’s funeral,
and Lisa knew it was always tough for me to hear it without having an
emotional response.

My musings were interrupted when a man sidled up next to me and said,
“This is just what I need to hear.” I introduced myself and then asked
why he needed this song. “I lost my son Cameron last week in a
motorcycle accident,” he said.

Wow! I was so focused on myself that I never considered the needs of
others, and God was busy using that song exactly where He wanted it to
be used. I took my new friend Mac, who worked at the center, aside,
and we talked about God’s care in this toughest time in his life.

All around us are people in need, and sometimes we have to set aside
our own feelings and agendas to help them. One way we can do that is
to remember how God has comforted us in our trials and troubles “so
that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves
receive from God” (2 Cor. 1:4). How easy it is to be engrossed in our
own concerns and forget that someone right next to us might need a
prayer, a word of comfort, a hug, or gift of mercy in Jesus’ name.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to see where help is needed, and help me to provide that
help. Thank You for the comfort You give; help me to share it.

Comfort received should be comfort shared.
