Hero Over Sin

Create in me a clean heart, O God. —
Psalm 51:10

Today's Scripture: 1 John 1

Not long ago, someone asked me a very tough question: “What is the
longest you have gone without sinning? A week, a day, an hour?” How
can we answer a question like that? If we’re truthful, we might say,
“I can’t live a day without sinning.” Or if we look back over the past
week, we might see that we haven’t confessed to God even one sin. But
we would be fooling ourselves if we said we hadn’t sinned in our
thoughts or actions for a week.

God knows our hearts and whether we’re sensitive to the convicting
power of the Holy Spirit. If we really know ourselves, we take 1 John
1:8 to heart, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us.” We certainly don’t want verse 10 to be
true of us, “If we say that we have not sinned, . . . His word is not
in us.”

A more encouraging question to ask might be: “What is God’s response
to our admission of sin and need for forgiveness?” The answer: “If we
confess . . . , He is faithful and just to forgive us” (v.9). Jesus
has taken our sin problem upon Himself by dying in our place and
rising again. That’s why He can create in us “a clean heart” (Ps.
51:10). My young friend Jaydon is right when he says, “Jesus is the
hero over our sins.”

Reflect & Pray

No one can say he doesn’t need Forgiveness for his sin, For all must
come to Christ by faith To have new life within. —Branon

Christ’s forgiveness is the door to a new beginning.
