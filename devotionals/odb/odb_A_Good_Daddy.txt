A Good Daddy

On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the
night.
Psalm 63:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 63

When our son, Xavier, was younger, business trips often pulled my
husband away from home. Though his father called often, there were
rough nights when the calls alone didn’t comfort Xavier. To help
soothe our son when he felt he needed his dad, I’d pull out our photo
albums as he prepared for bedtime. I’d point out the images that
showed them spending time together and ask, “Do you remember this?”

Memory after memory encouraged our son, who often said, “I have a good
daddy.”

I understood Xavier’s need to be reminded of his father’s love when he
couldn’t see him. Whenever I’m going through tough or lonely times, I
too long to know I’m loved, especially by my heavenly Father.

David proclaimed his deep yearning for God as he hid from his enemies
in the desert (Psalm 63:1). Remembering his personal encounters with
God’s limitless power and satisfying love led him to praise (vv. 2–5).
Through his most difficult nights, David could still rejoice in his
dependable Father’s loving care (vv. 6–8).

During our dark times, when we feel as if God’s not there for us, we
need reminders of who God is and how He’s demonstrated His love.
Reflecting on our personal experiences with Him, as well as His
actions recorded in Scripture, can affirm the countless ways our good
Abba Father loves us.
