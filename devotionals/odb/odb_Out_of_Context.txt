Out of Context

She turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not
realize that it was Jesus.
John 20:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 20:13–16

As I queued up to board my flight, someone tapped my shoulder. I
turned and received a warm greeting. “Elisa! Do you remember me? It’s
Joan!” My mind flipped through various “Joans” I’d known, but I
couldn’t place her. Was she a previous neighbor? A past coworker? Oh
dear . . . I didn’t know.

Sensing my struggle, Joan responded, “Elisa, we knew each other in
high school.” A memory rose: Friday night football games, cheering
from the stands. Once the context was clarified, I recognized Joan.

After Jesus’s death, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early in the
morning and found the stone rolled away and His body gone (John
20:1–2). She ran to get Peter and John, who returned with her to find
the tomb empty (vv. 3–10). But Mary lingered outside in her grief (v.
11). When Jesus appeared there, “she did not realize that it was
Jesus” (v. 14), thinking He was the gardener (v. 15).

How could she have not recognized Jesus? Was His resurrected body so
changed that it was difficult to recognize Him? Did her grief blind
her to His identity? Or, perhaps, like me, was it because Jesus was
“out of context,” alive in the garden instead of dead in the tomb,
that she didn’t recognize Him?

How might we too miss Jesus when He comes into our days—during prayer
or Bible reading, or by simply whispering in our hearts?

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, give us eyes to see Jesus, however He comes—in a familiar
context or surprising us in an unexpected one.

Expect Jesus in unexpected places.
