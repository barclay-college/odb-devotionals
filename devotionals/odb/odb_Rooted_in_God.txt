Rooted in God

They will be like a tree planted by the water . . . its leaves are
always green.
Jeremiah 17:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 17:5–8

When friends moved into a new home, they planted wisteria near their
fence and looked forward to the lavender blossom that would appear
after five years of growth. Over two decades they enjoyed this plant,
carefully pruning and tending it. But suddenly the wisteria died, for
their neighbors had poured some weed killer by the other side of the
fence. The poison seeped into the wisteria’s roots and the tree
perished—or so my friends thought. To their surprise, the following
year some shoots came through the ground.

We see the image of trees flourishing and perishing when the prophet
Jeremiah relates them to God’s people who either trust in the Lord or
ignore His ways. Those who follow God will send their roots into soil
near water and will bear fruit (Jer. 17:8), but those who follow their
own hearts will be like a bush in the desert (vv. 5–6). The prophet
yearns that God’s people would rely on the true and living God, that
they would be “a tree planted by the water” (v. 8).

We know the “Father is the gardener” (John 15:1) and that in Him we
can trust and have confidence (Jer. 17:7). May we follow Him with our
whole heart as we bear fruit that lasts.
