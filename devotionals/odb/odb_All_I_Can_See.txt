All I Can See

He must become greater; I must become less.
John 3:30

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 3:22–35

Krista stood in the freezing cold on a winter day, looking at the
beautiful snow-encased lighthouse along the lake. As she pulled out
her phone to take pictures, her glasses fogged over. She couldn’t see
a thing so she decided to point her camera toward the lighthouse and
snapped three pictures at different angles. Looking at them later, she
realized the camera had been set to take “selfies.” She laughed as she
said, “My focus was me, me, and me. All I saw was me.” Krista’s photos
got me thinking of a similar mistake: We can become so self-focused we
lose sight of the bigger picture of God’s plan.

Jesus’s cousin John clearly knew his focus wasn’t himself. Right from
the start he recognized that his position or calling was to point
others to Jesus, the Son of God. “Look, the Lamb of God!” he said when
he saw Jesus coming toward him and his followers (John 1:29). He
continued, “The reason I came baptizing with water was that he might
be revealed” (v. 31). When John’s disciples later reported that Jesus
was gaining followers, John said, “You yourselves can testify that I
said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.’ . . . He must
become greater; I must become less” (3:28–30).

May the central focus of our lives be Jesus and loving Him with our
whole heart.

Reflect & Pray

How can I love Jesus best? Who might He want me to love?

Lord, I often get centered on myself and my needs and wants. Help me
to look outside of myself to You.
