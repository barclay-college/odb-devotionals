Truth: Bitter or Sweet?

So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.
Ezekiel 3:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ezekiel 2:4–3:3

I’d had the spot on my nose for the better part of a year when I went
to the doctor. The biopsy results came back days later with words I
didn’t want to hear: skin cancer. Though the cancer was operable and
not life-threatening, it was a bitter pill to swallow.

God commanded Ezekiel to swallow a bitter pill—a scroll containing
words of lament and woe (Ezekiel 2:10; 3:1–2). He was “to fill [his]
stomach with it” and share the words with the people of Israel, whom
God considered “obstinate and stubborn” (2:4). One would expect a
scroll filled with correction to taste like a bitter pill. Yet Ezekiel
describes it being “as sweet as honey” in his mouth (3:3).

Ezekiel seems to have acquired a taste for God’s correction. Instead
of viewing His rebuke as something to avoid, Ezekiel recognized that
what is good for the soul is “sweet.” God instructs and corrects us
with lovingkindness, helping us live in a way that honors and pleases
Him.

Some truths are bitter pills to swallow while others taste sweet. If
we remember how much God loves us, His truth will taste more like
honey. His words are given to us for our good, providing wisdom and
strength to forgive others, refrain from gossip, and bear up under
mistreatment. Help us, God, to recognize Your wisdom as the sweet
counsel it truly is!
