Clothes for the Climate

Over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in
perfect unity.
Colossians 3:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:8–17

While removing the price tag from an item of winter clothing I had
purchased, I smiled at these words on the back: “WARNING: This
innovative product will make you want to go outdoors and stay there.” 
When properly clothed for the climate, a person can survive and even
thrive in harsh and changing weather conditions.

The same principle is true in our spiritual lives. As followers of
Jesus, our all-weather spiritual wardrobe has been prescribed by the
Lord in His Word, the Bible. “As God’s chosen people, holy and dearly
loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility,
gentleness and patience. . . . Forgive as the Lord forgave you” (Col.
3:12–13 emphasis added).

These garments that God provides—such as kindness, humility, and
gentleness—allow us to meet hostility and criticism with patience,
forgiveness, and love. They give us staying power in the storms of
life.

When we face adverse conditions at home, school, or work, the
“clothing” God tells us to wear protects us and enables us to make a
positive difference. “And over all these virtues put on love, which
binds them all together in perfect unity” (v. 14).

Dressing according to God’s guidelines doesn’t change the weather—it
equips the wearer.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, help me to put on Your garment of love so that I am
prepared for whatever life brings me today.

Kindness is the oil that takes the friction out of life.
