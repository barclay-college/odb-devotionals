Doubts And Faith

My Lord and my God! —
John 20:28

Today's Scripture: John 20:24-31

Can a believer in Jesus who has occasional doubts about matters of
faith ever be effective in serving the Lord? Some people think that
mature and growing Christians never question their beliefs. But just
as we have experiences that can build our faith, we can also have
experiences that cause us to temporarily doubt.

The disciple Thomas had initial doubts about reports of Jesus’
resurrection. He said, “Unless I see in His hands the print of the
nails, . . . I will not believe” (John 20:25). Christ did not rebuke
Thomas but showed him the evidence he asked for. Amazed at seeing the
risen Savior, Thomas exclaimed: “My Lord and my God!” (20:28). After
this incident, the New Testament says very little about what happened
to Thomas.

A number of early church traditions, however, claim that Thomas went
to India as a missionary. It is said that while there he preached the
gospel, worked miracles, and planted churches. Some of these churches
in India still have active congregations that trace their founding
back to Thomas.

A time of doubt doesn’t have to become a life pattern. Allow God to
lead you into a deeper understanding of His reality. Renew your faith.
You can still accomplish great things for Him.

Reflect & Pray

When faith grows weak and doubts arise, Recall God’s love and tender
care; Remind yourself of all He’s done And of those times He answered
prayer. —D. De Haan

Learn to doubt your doubts and believe your beliefs.
