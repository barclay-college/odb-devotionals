World’s Longest Table

I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day
when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom. —
Matthew 26:29

Today's Scripture: Matthew 26:26-30

On Sunday, July 18, 2010, one of the busiest highways in Europe became
what some called “the longest table in the world.” Officials closed a
60-kilometer (37-mile) section of the A40 Autobahn in Germany’s Ruhr
region so people could walk and bicycle or sit at one of 20,000 tables
set up on the roadway. An estimated 2 million people came to enjoy an
event the director hoped would connect people from many cultures,
generations, and nations.

This event made me think of an even grander table around which
believers gather to share the Lord’s Supper. During communion, we
remember Jesus’ death for us as we anticipate the culmination of
history at His return.

Just before Jesus was crucified, He shared the Passover meal with His
disciples, telling them, “I will not drink of this fruit of the vine
from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s
kingdom” (Matt. 26:29).

The Lord’s Table unites everyone Christ has redeemed by His blood “out
of every tribe and tongue and people and nation” (Rev. 5:9). One day,
in a scene of reunion and joy, all who belong to Jesus will sit down
together with Him at a table that will dwarf the Autobahn gathering.
We joyfully anticipate sharing that table together!

Reflect & Pray

Here we gather to remember, In the breaking of the bread, Jesus, who
for us was broken, And is now our living Head. —Anon.

Christ’s love creates unity out of diversity.
