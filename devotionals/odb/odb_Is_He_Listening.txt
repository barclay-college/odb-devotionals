Is He Listening?

My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
Matthew 27:46

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 26:39-42; 27:45-46

“Sometimes it feels as if God isn’t listening to me.” Those words,
from a woman who tried to stay strong in her walk with God while
coping with an alcoholic husband, echo the heartcry of many believers.
For many years, she asked God to change her husband. Yet it never
happened.

What are we to think when we repeatedly ask God for something
good—something that could easily glorify Him—but the answer doesn’t
come? Is He listening or not?

Let’s look at the life of the Savior. In the garden of Gethsemane, He
agonized for hours in prayer, pouring out His heart and pleading, “Let
this cup pass from Me” (Matt. 26:39 nkjv). But the Father’s answer was
clearly “No.” To provide salvation, God had to send Jesus to die on
the cross. Even though Jesus felt as if His Father had forsaken Him,
He prayed intensely and passionately because He trusted that God was
listening.

When we pray, we may not see how God is working or understand how He
will bring good through it all. So we have to trust Him. We relinquish
our rights and let God do what is best.

We must leave the unknowable to the all-knowing One. He is listening
and working things out His way.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we don’t need to know the reason our prayers sometimes go
unanswered. Help us just to wait for Your time, because You are good.

When we bend our knees to pray, God bends His ear to listen.
