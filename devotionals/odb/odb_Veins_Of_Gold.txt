Veins Of Gold

If we have been united together in the likeness of His death,
certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection. —
Romans 6:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 6:1-14

While visiting the charming Cotswold area of England, I purchased some
bone china mugs as souvenirs. I used them carefully, but eventually
one fell into the sink and shattered. I thought about that mug
recently when I learned about the Japanese art of Kintsugi.

Usually when something breaks we are happy to repair it enough to make
it functional again. But several hundred years ago, a Japanese artist
decided he would make broken china beautiful. So he started using
golden resin to hold the fragments together. Pieces repaired by using
his method have intricate veins of gold.

Early in the human story, sin entered the world (Gen. 3). Theologians
refer to the event as “the fall.” The inevitable result is brokenness.
Life is painful because we keep getting hurt and hurting others with
our sharp, jagged edges. But God doesn’t want us to stay broken, and
His repair work turns our brokenness into beauty.

Like a Kintsugi artist, God repairs us. But He uses something more
precious than gold—the blood of His Son. Instead of having veins of
gold, we are united by the very veins of Christ. “We have been united
together in the likeness of His death” (Rom. 6:5). Nothing is more
beautiful than that.

Reflect & Pray

He shed His blood, poured out His life; He gave His all at Calvary; Oh
what can we give in return For love so rich, so full, so free? —Anon.

The price of our freedom from sin was paid by Jesus’ blood.
