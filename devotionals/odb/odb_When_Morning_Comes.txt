When Morning Comes

Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what
we do not see.
Hebrews 11:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 11:1–8

It was very late when we stopped for the night at a country inn
outside of Munich. We were delighted to see that our cozy room had a
balcony, although an oppressive fog made it impossible to see into the
darkness. But when the sun rose a few hours later, the haze began to
fade. Then we could see what had been grimly shrouded the night
before—a completely idyllic scene—peaceful and lush green meadow,
sheep grazing with tiny tinkling bells about their necks, and big
white clouds in the sky that looked exactly like more sheep—huge,
fluffy sheep!

Sometimes life can get clouded over by a heavy fog of despair. Our
situation may look so dark that we begin to lose hope. But just as the
sun burns away a fog, our faith in God can burn away the haze of
doubt. Hebrews 11 defines faith as “confidence in what we hope for and
assurance about what we do not see” (v. 1). The passage goes on to
remind us of the faith of Noah, who was “warned about things not yet
seen,” yet obeyed God (v. 7). And Abraham who went where God
directed—even though he didn’t know where that would be (v. 8).

Though we have not seen Him and cannot always feel His presence, God
is always present and will help us through our darkest nights.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for Your promise to walk with us through all of
life. In moments of doubt, help us to have the confidence You are in
control and we can trust You.
