The Best Season Yet

See then that you walk circumspectly, . . . redeeming the time,
because the days are evil. —
Ephesians 5:15-16

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 5:15-21

Life is a lot like the weather . . . it’s seasonal. It has a way of
pushing us into the next season whether we like it or not. And when
pushed into the next season, we are often uncertain and even fearful
of what it might hold for us.

This is especially true of later seasons of life, when we are haunted
by thoughts such as: Will I be left all alone? Will my health hold up?
Will my money last? Will my mind stay fresh? As with every season of
life, we have to make a choice—to waste the season in fearful thoughts
or, as Paul says, make “the best use of the time, because the days are
evil” (Eph. 5:16 esv).

Regardless of your season, you can count on God’s faithfulness. He
says, “‘I will never leave you nor forsake you.’ So we may boldly say:
‘The Lord is my helper; I will not fear’” (Heb. 13:5-6).

Because you have God’s presence and provision, you can make the most
of your time in every season by following Jesus closely, spending time
in His Word and prayer, loving and forgiving more freely than ever
before, and serving others with joy and generosity.

God has blessed us with our present season—make the most of it!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give me the grace to accept life right where it has put me, and
help me to overcome the fear that would waste my days. Give me the
wisdom and desire to make every day count for You.

Life matters—make the most of it!
