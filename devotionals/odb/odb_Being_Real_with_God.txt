Being Real with God

Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
1 Peter 5:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 5:6–10

I bow my head, close my eyes, lace my fingers together and begin to
pray. “Dear Lord, I’m coming to you today as your child. I recognize
your power and goodness. . .” Suddenly, my eyes snap open. I remember
that my son hasn’t finished his history project, which is due the next
day. I recall that he has an after-school basketball game, and I
imagine him awake until midnight finishing his schoolwork. This leads
me to worry that his fatigue will put him at risk for the flu!

C. S. Lewis wrote about distractions during prayer in his book The
Screwtape Letters. He noted that when our minds wander, we tend to use
willpower to steer ourselves back to our original prayer. Lewis
concluded, though, that it was better to accept “the distraction as
[our] present problem and [lay] that before [God] and make it the main
theme of [our] prayers.”

A persistent worry or even a sinful thought that disrupts a prayer may
become the centerpiece of our discussion with God. God wants us to be
real as we talk with Him and open up about our deepest concerns,
fears, and struggles. He is not surprised by anything we mention. His
interest in us is like the attention we would receive from a close
friend. That’s why we’re encouraged to give all of our worries and
cares to God—because He cares for us (1 Peter 5:7).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, You know what’s on my mind today. Help me to experience the
peace that comes from sharing my concerns with You.

Distractions don’t have to derail our prayers.
