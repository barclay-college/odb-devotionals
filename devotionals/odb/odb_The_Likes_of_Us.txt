The Likes of Us

Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his
harvest field. —
Matthew 9:38

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 9:35-38

In the late 18th century, William Carey felt a call to travel to India
as a missionary to share the good news of Jesus. Pastors around him
scoffed: “Young man, if God wants to save [anyone] in India, He will
do it without your help or mine!” They missed the point of
partnership. God does very little on earth without the likes of us.

As partners in God’s work on earth, we insist that God’s will be done
while at the same time committing ourselves to whatever that may
require of us. “Your kingdom come. Your will be done,” Jesus taught us
to pray (Matt. 6:10). These words are not calm requests but holy
demands. Give us justice! Set the world aright!

We have different roles to play, we and God. It is our role to follow
in Jesus’ steps by doing the work of the kingdom both by our deeds and
by our prayers.

We are Christ’s body on earth, to borrow Paul’s metaphor in Colossians
1:24. Those we serve, Christ serves. When we extend mercy to the
broken, we reach out with the hands of Christ Himself.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You have called us Your friends. In some small way, help us to
show Your love to this hurting world so they will know You.

Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God. William
Carey
