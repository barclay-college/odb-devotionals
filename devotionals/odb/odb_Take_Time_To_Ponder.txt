Take Time To Ponder

Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. —
Luke 2:19

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:8-19

Parents love to remember the developmental milestones of their
children. They will record in a baby book when their little ones first
roll over, then crawl, and take their first steps. Often they will
take photographs and save baby clothing to bring back the memories of
those precious experiences.

According to Luke 2:19, Mary, the mother of Jesus, kept a baby book of
sorts—in her heart. She treasured the promises that had been given
about her Son and “pondered them.” The Greek word for “ponder” means
“placing together for comparison.” Mary had heard of great things
concerning her Son from angels and shepherds (1:32; 2:17-18). As His
life unfolded, she would compare those promises with how her Son acted
to fulfill them.

Our faith will be strengthened and we will be encouraged when we
meditate on what the Scriptures say about God and compare it with the
way He works in our own lives (John 14:21). He is a God who answers
prayer (1 John 5:14-15), comforts us in our suffering (2 Cor. 1:3-4),
and provides for our needs (Phil. 4:19).

When we take time to ponder, we will see the faithfulness of our great
God.
