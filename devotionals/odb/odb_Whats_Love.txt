What’s Love?

In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent
His Son. —
1 John 4:10

Today's Scripture: Psalm 103:1-14

When asked “What’s love?” children have some great answers. Noelle,
age 7, said, “Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he
wears it every day.” Rebecca, who is 8, answered, “Since my
grandmother got arthritis, she can’t bend over and polish her toenails
anymore. So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even after
his hands got arthritis too. That’s love.” Jessica, also 8, concluded,
“You really shouldn’t say ‘I love you’ unless you mean it. But if you
mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget.”

Sometimes we need reminding that God loves us. We focus on the
difficulties of life and wonder, Where’s the love? But if we pause and
consider all that God has done for us, we remember how much we are
loved by God, who is love (1 John 4:8-10).

Psalm 103 lists the “benefits” God showers on us in love: He forgives
our sin (v.3), satisfies us with good things (v.5), and executes
righteousness and justice (v.6). He is slow to anger and abounds in
mercy (v.8). He doesn’t deal with us as our sins deserve (v.10) and
has removed our sin as far as the east is from the west (v.12). He has
not forgotten us!

What’s love? God is love, and He’s pouring out that love on you and
me.

Reflect & Pray

Our God is God— His truth, His love remains each day the same, He’s
faithful to His matchless name, For God is God—He does not change. —D.
DeHaan

The death of Christ is the measure of God’s love for you.
