Lasting Regrets

When I kept silent, my bones grew old through my groaning all the day
long. —
Psalm 32:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 32:1-7

While I was talking with a gifted pianist, she asked me if I played
any musical instruments. When I responded, “I play the radio,” she
laughed and asked if I had ever wanted to play any instrument. My
embarrassed answer was, “I took piano lessons as a boy but gave it
up.” Now, in my adult years, I regret not continuing with the piano. I
love music and wish I could play today. That conversation was a fresh
reminder to me that life is often constituted by the choices we
make—and some of them produce regret.

Some choices produce much more serious and painful regrets. King David
discovered this when he chose to sleep with another man’s wife and
then killed that man. He described the guilt that filled him as
devastating, saying, “When I kept silent, my bones grew old through my
groaning all the day long. For day and night Your hand was heavy upon
me; my vitality was turned into the drought of summer” (Ps. 32:3-4).
But David acknowledged and confessed his sin to God and found
forgiveness (v.5).

It is only from God that we can receive the grace of forgiveness when
our choices have produced painful regrets. And only in Him do we find
the wisdom to make better choices.

Reflect & Pray

Father of mercies, forgive me for the foolish choices I have made.
Please enable me to be wiser in my choices. Teach me the value of
resting in Your grace.

God’s forgiveness frees us from the chains of regret.
