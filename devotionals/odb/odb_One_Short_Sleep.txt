One Short Sleep

We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and
at home with the Lord.
2 Corinthians 5:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18

Henry Durbanville, a Scottish pastor from another era, told the story
of an elderly woman in his parish who lived in a remote part of
Scotland. She longed to see the city of Edinburgh, but she was afraid
to take the journey because of the long, dark tunnel through which the
train had to pass to get there.

One day, however, circumstances compelled her to go to Edinburgh, and
as the train sped toward the city, her agitation increased. But before
the train reached the tunnel, the woman, worn out with worry, fell
fast asleep. When she awoke she had already arrived in the city!

It’s possible that some of us will not experience death. If we’re
alive when Jesus returns, we will “meet the Lord in the air” (1 Thess.
4:13–18). But many of us will pass into heaven through death and for
some that thought causes great anxiety. We worry that the process of
dying will be too difficult to bear.

With the assurance of Jesus as our Savior we can rest in the
confidence that when we close our eyes on earth and pass through
death, we will open our eyes in God’s presence. “One short sleep past
we wake eternally,” John Donne said.

Reflect & Pray

I love the life You’ve given to me, Lord, yet I wonder what it will be
like to see You personally. Help me to trust You with the future. I
look forward to that day when I meet You.

To see Jesus will be heaven’s greatest joy.
