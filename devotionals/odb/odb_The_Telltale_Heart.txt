The Telltale Heart

If our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all
things. —
1 John 3:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 3:16-24

Recently I read about a private investigator in the US who would knock
on a door, show his badge to whoever answered, and say, “I guess we
don’t have to tell you why we’re here.” Many times, the person would
look stunned and say, “How did you find out?” then go on to describe
an undiscovered criminal act committed long ago. Writing in
Smithsonian magazine, Ron Rosenbaum described the reaction as “an
opening for the primal force of conscience, the telltale heart’s
internal monologue.”

We all know things about ourselves that no one else knows—failures,
faults, sins—that although confessed to God and forgiven by Him may
come back to accuse us again and again. John, one of Jesus’ close
followers, wrote about God’s love for us and the call to follow His
commands, saying: “By this we know that we are of the truth, and shall
assure our hearts before Him. For if our heart condemns us, God is
greater than our heart, and knows all things” (1 John 3:19-20).

Our confidence toward God grows out of His love and forgiveness in
Christ, not our performance in life. “We know that He abides in us, by
the Spirit whom He has given us” (v.24).

God, who knows everything about us, is greater than our self-
condemnation.

Reflect & Pray

No condemnation now I dread, I am my Lord’s and He is mine; Alive in
Him, my living Head, And clothed in righteousness divine. — Wesley

The one who receives Christ will never receive God’s condemnation.
