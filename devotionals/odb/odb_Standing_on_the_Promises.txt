Standing on the Promises

Ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
John 15:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 15:5–8

My friend’s brother (when they were both children) assured his sister
an umbrella had enough lift to hold her up if she would only
“believe.” So “by faith” she jumped off a barn roof and knocked
herself out, suffering a minor concussion.

What God has promised, He will do. But we must be sure we stand on
God’s actual word when we claim a promise, for only then do we have
the assurance that God will do or give what He’s promised. Faith has
no power in itself. It only counts when it’s based on a clear and
unambiguous promise from God. Anything else is just wishful thinking.

Here’s a case in point: God has promised, “Ask whatever you wish, and
it will be done for you. This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear
much fruit” (John 15:7–8). These verses are not a promise that God
will answer every prayer we utter, but rather a promise that He will
respond to every longing for personal righteousness, what Paul calls
“the fruit of the Spirit” (Galatians 5:22–23). If we hunger and thirst
for holiness and ask God for it, He will begin to satisfy us. It will
take time; for spiritual growth, like human growth, is gradual. Don’t
give up. Keep asking God to make you holy. In His time and at His pace
“it will be done for you.” God doesn’t make promises He doesn’t keep.
