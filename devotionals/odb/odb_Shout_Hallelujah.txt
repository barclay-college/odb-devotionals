Shout Hallelujah!

O Death, where is your sting? —
1 Corinthians 15:55

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 15:50-58

A few days ago, I spied my old friend Bob vigorously pedaling a bike
at our neighborhood gym and staring down at a blood pressure monitor
on his finger.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“Looking to see if I’m alive,” he grunted.

“What would you do if you saw you were dead?” I countered.

“Shout hallelujah!” he replied with a radiant smile.

Over the years I’ve caught glimpses of great inner strength in Bob:
patient endurance in the face of physical decline and discomfort, and
faith and hope as he approaches the end of his life journey. Indeed he
has found not only hope, but death has lost its power to tyrannize
him.

Who can find peace and hope—and even joy—in dying? Only those who are
joined by faith to the God of eternity and who know that they have
eternal life (1 Cor. 15:52,54). For those who have this assurance,
like my friend Bob, death has lost its terror. They can speak with
colossal joy of seeing Christ face to face!

Why be afraid of death? Why not rejoice? As the poet John Donne
(1572–1631) wrote, “One short sleep past, we wake eternally.”
