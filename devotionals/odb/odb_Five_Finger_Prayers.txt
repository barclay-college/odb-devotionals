Five-Finger Prayers

Pray for each other.
James 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 5:13–18

Prayer is a conversation with God, not a formula. Yet sometimes we
might need to use a “method” to freshen up our prayer time. We can
pray the Psalms or other Scriptures (such as The Lord’s Prayer), or
use the ACTS method (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, and
Supplication). I recently came across this “Five-Finger Prayer” to use
as a guide when praying for others:

• When you fold your hands, the thumb is nearest you. So begin by
praying for those closest to you—your loved ones (Phil. 1:3–5).

• The index finger is the pointer. Pray for those who teach—Bible
teachers and preachers, and those who teach children (1 Thess. 5:25).

• The next finger is the tallest. It reminds you to pray for those in
authority over you—national and local leaders, and your supervisor at
work (1 Tim. 2:1–2).

• The fourth finger is usually the weakest. Pray for those who are in
trouble or who are suffering (James 5:13–16).

• Then comes your little finger. It reminds you of your smallness in
relation to God’s greatness. Ask Him to supply your needs (Phil. 4:6,
19).

Whatever method you use, just talk with your Father. He wants to hear
what’s on your heart.

Reflect & Pray

Father, give me the wisdom to know how to pray for others.

It’s not the words we pray that matter; it’s the condition of our
heart.
