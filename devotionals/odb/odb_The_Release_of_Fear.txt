The Release of Fear

Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.
Mark 6:50

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 6:45–53

Our bodies react to our feelings of dread and fear. A weight in the
pit of our stomachs, along with our hearts pounding as we gulp for
breath, signal our sense of anxiety. Our physical nature keeps us from
ignoring these feelings of unease.

The disciples felt shockwaves of fear one night after Jesus had
performed the miracle of feeding more than five thousand people. The
Lord had sent them ahead to Bethsaida so He could be alone to pray.
During the night, they were rowing against the wind when suddenly they
saw Him walking on the water. Thinking He was a ghost, they were
terrified (Mark 6:49–50).

But Jesus reassured them, telling them not to be afraid and to take
courage. As He entered their vessel, the wind died down and they made
it to the shore. I imagine that their feelings of dread calmed as they
embraced the peace He bestowed.

When we’re feeling breathless with anxiety, we can rest assured in
Jesus’s power. Whether He calms our waves or strengthens us to face
them, He will give us the gift of His peace that “transcends all
understanding” (Philippians 4:7). And as He releases us from our
fears, our spirits and our bodies can return to a state of rest.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus Christ, help me when the dread seems to cling to me.
Release me from my fears and give me Your peace.

The Lord releases us from fear.
