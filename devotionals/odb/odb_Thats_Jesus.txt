That’s Jesus!

He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our
iniquities. —
Isaiah 53:5

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 53:4-12

As a Jewish kid growing up in New York, Michael Brown had no interest
in spiritual things. His life revolved around being a drummer for a
band, and he got mixed up with drugs. But then some friends invited
him to church, where he found the love and prayers of the people to be
irresistible. After a short spiritual struggle, Michael trusted Jesus
as Savior.

This was a monumental change for a wayward Jewish teen. One day he
told his dad he had heard about Old Testament texts describing Jesus.
His dad, incredulous, asked, “Where?” When Michael opened his Bible,
it fell to Isaiah 53. They read it, and Michael exclaimed, “That’s
Him! That’s Jesus!”

Indeed, it is Jesus. Through the help of Christians and the guidance
of the Holy Spirit, Brown (today a Bible scholar and an author) came
to recognize the Messiah of Isaiah 53. He experienced the salvation
that changes lives, forgives sin, and gives abundant life to all who
trust the “Man of sorrows” (v.3). Jesus is the One who was “wounded
for our transgressions” and who died for us on the cross (v.5).

The Bible reveals Jesus, who alone has the power to change lives.

Reflect & Pray

God, I struggle with this idea of Jesus as Savior. I know He’s a good
man, but I need to see that He is more than that. Please show
me—through others or through the Bible—how I can know for sure who
Jesus is.

The Spirit of God uses the Word of God to change hearts.
