God In The Storm

He is excellent in power. —
Job 37:23

Today's Scripture: Job 37:14-24

Early one morning the wind began to blow and raindrops hit my house
like small stones. I peered outside at the yellow-gray sky and watched
as trees thrashed in the wind. Veins of lightning lit the sky
accompanied by bone-rattling thunder. The power blinked on and off,
and I wondered how long the bad weather would continue.

After the storm passed, I opened my Bible to begin my day with reading
Scripture. I read a passage in Job that compared the Lord’s power to
the atmospheric muscle of a storm. Job’s friend, Elihu said, “God
thunders marvelously with His voice” (37:5). And, “He covers His hands
with lightning, and commands it to strike” (36:32). Indeed, God is
“excellent in power” (37:23).

Compared to God, we humans are feeble. We’re unable to help ourselves
spiritually, heal our hearts, or fix the injustice we often endure.
Fortunately, the God of the storm cares about weaklings like us; He
“remembers that we are dust” (Ps. 103:14). What’s more, God “gives
power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases
strength” (Isa. 40:29). Because God is strong, He can help us in our
weakness.

I sing the mighty power of God That made the mountains rise, That
spread the flowing seas abroad And built the lofty skies. —Watts

God is the source of our strength.
