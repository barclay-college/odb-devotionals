Paul, The Aged

Being such a one as Paul, the aged, . . . I appeal to you for my son
Onesimus. —
Philemon 1:9-10

Today's Scripture: Philemon 1:1-9

Celebrating my 60th birthday really changed my perspective on life— I
used to think people in their sixties were “old.” Then I started
counting the number of productive years I might have left and set the
number at 10. I went along with this dead-end kind of thinking until I
remembered a very productive co-worker who was 85. So I sought him out
to ask what life after 60 was like. He told me of some of the
wonderful ministry opportunities the Lord had given him over the last
25 years.

The apostle Paul, referring to himself as “aged” in Philemon 1:9,
really resonates with my own sense of aging: “Being such a one as
Paul, the aged, . . . I appeal to you for my son Onesimus” (vv.9-10).
Paul was asking Philemon to take back his runaway servant Onesimus.
Some scholars believe Paul was in his late forties or early fifties
when he wrote this—certainly not a senior citizen by today’s
standards. But life expectancy in those days was much shorter. Yet
despite awareness of his mature years, Paul went on to serve the Lord
for several more years.

While we may experience physical or other kinds of limitations, what
really matters is that we continue doing what we can for the Lord
until He calls us Home.
