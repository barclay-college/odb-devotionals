God’s Enduring Word

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
Matthew 24:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:89-96

At the beginning of World War II, aerial bombings flattened much of
Warsaw, Poland. Cement blocks, ruptured plumbing, and shards of glass
lay strewn across the great city. In the downtown area, however, most
of one damaged building still stubbornly stood. It was the Polish
headquarters for the British and Foreign Bible Society. Still legible
on a surviving wall were these words: “Heaven and earth will pass
away, but my words will never pass away” (Matt. 24:35).

Jesus made that statement to encourage His disciples when they asked
Him about the “end of the age” (v. 3). But His words also give us
courage in the midst of our embattled situation today. Standing in the
rubble of our shattered dreams, we can still find confidence in God’s
indestructible character, sovereignty, and promises.

The psalmist wrote: “Your word, Lord, is eternal; it stands firm in
the heavens” (Ps. 119:89). But it is more than the word of the Lord;
it is His very character. That is why the psalmist could also say,
“Your faithfulness continues through all generations” (v. 90).

As we face devastating experiences, we can define them either in terms
of despair or of hope. Because God will not abandon us to our
circumstances, we can confidently choose hope. His enduring Word
assures us of His unfailing love.
