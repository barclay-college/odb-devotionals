Wonderfully Made

I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. —
Psalm 139:14

Today's Scripture: Psalm 139:1-16

When I was a child, someone close to me thought they could motivate me
to do better by frequently asking me, “Why are you so stupid?” I
didn’t know how much this had affected me until I was a teenager and
heard someone behind me say, “Stupid!” At the word, I quickly turned
around, thinking he was talking to me.

Knowing Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord helped me to realize that
because God created me in His image (Gen. 1:27), I’m not stupid but am
“fearfully and wonderfully made” (Ps. 139:14). God declares that all
He has made is “very good” (Gen. 1:31), and the Psalms remind us that
we are “skillfully wrought” (Ps. 139:15).

The psalmist David describes how God knows each one of us intimately:
“O Lord, You have searched me and known me. You know my sitting down
and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off. You comprehend
my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways”
(vv.1-3).

Not only are we wonderfully made, but because of Christ’s death on the
cross, we can also be wonderfully restored to a right relationship
with God. “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation . . . . All
this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ” (2 Cor.
5:17-18 NIV).

Reflect & Pray

In His own image God created man, He formed his body from the dust of
the earth; But more than that, to all who are in Christ He gives
eternal life by second birth. —Hess

Each person is a unique expression of God’s loving design.
