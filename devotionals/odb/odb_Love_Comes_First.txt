Love Comes First

We love [God] because he first loved us.
1 John 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:7-19

One evening my friend showed me one of the three decorative plaques
that would be part of a wall arrangement in her living room. “See,
I’ve already got Love,” she said, holding up the plaque with the word
written on it. “Faith and Hope are on order.”

So Love comes first, I thought. Faith and Hope soon follow!

Love did come first. In fact, it originated with God. First John 4:19
reminds us that “We love [God] because he first loved us.” God’s love,
described in 1 Corinthians 13 (known as the “love chapter”), explains
a characteristic of real love when it says, “Love never fails” (v. 8).

Faith and hope are essential to the believer. It is only because we
are justified by faith that “we have peace with God through our Lord
Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:1). And hope is described in Hebrews 6 as “an
anchor for the soul, firm and secure” (v. 19).

One day we will have no need of faith and hope. Faith will become
sight and our hope will be realized when we see our Savior face to
face. But love is eternal, for love is of God and God is love (1 John
4:7-8). “Now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the
greatest of these is love”—it’s first and last (1 Cor. 13:13).
