Evie’s Decision

Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.
Mark 16:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 1:1–8

Evie was one of 25 American teenagers in a high school choir who
traveled to Jamaica to sing, witness, and show God’s love to people of
a different culture and generation. And for Evie, one day of that trip
was particularly memorable and joy-filled.

That day, the choir went to a nursing home to sing and visit with the
residents. After they sang, Evie sat down with a young woman who lived
at the home, a woman in her early 30s. As they began to chat, Evie
felt that she should talk about Jesus—who He is and what He did for
us. She showed her verses in the Bible that explained salvation. Soon
the woman said she wanted to trust Jesus as her Savior. And that’s
just what she did.

Because of Evie’s decision to start a conversation about Jesus, our
group celebrated a new birth into God’s family that day.

Mark 16:15 tells us that what Evie did is what is expected of all
believers. Here’s how The Message paraphrases that verse: “Go
everywhere and announce the Message of God’s good news to one and
all.”

May we never underestimate the wonder of what it means for anyone,
anywhere to hear the good news and to say yes to our Savior.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, it’s not easy to strike up a conversation about the
gospel. Please allow the Holy Spirit to work in me so I will be
willing and able to mention the good news to anyone who needs You.

Effective witnesses not only know their faith but show their faith.
