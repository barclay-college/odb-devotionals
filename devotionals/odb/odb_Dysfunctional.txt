Dysfunctional

For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
Romans 3:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 3:10–26

The word dysfunctional is often used to describe individuals,
families, relationships, organizations, and even governments. While
functional means it’s in proper working order, dysfunctional is the
opposite—it’s broken, not working properly, unable to do what it was
designed to do.

In his letter to the Romans, the apostle Paul begins by describing a
spiritually dysfunctional humanity (1:18–32). We are all part of that
rebellious company: “All have turned away, they have together become
worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one. . . . For all
have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (3:12, 23).

The good news is that “all are justified freely by [God’s] grace
through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus . . . to be received
by faith” (vv. 24–25). When we invite Christ into our lives and accept
God’s offer of forgiveness and new life, we are on the path to
becoming the person He created us to be. We don’t immediately become
perfect, but we no longer have to remain broken and dysfunctional.

Through the Holy Spirit we receive daily strength to honor God in what
we say and do and to “put off [our] old self . . . to be made new in
the attitude of [our] minds; and to put on the new self, created to be
like God in true righteousness and holiness” (Eph. 4:22–24).
