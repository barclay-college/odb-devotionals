Reflecting God’s Glory

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His
handiwork.
Psalm 19:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 31:1-11

The 12th-century Chinese artist Li Tang painted landscapes animated
with people, birds, and water buffalo. Because of his genius with fine
line sketches on silk, Li Tang is considered a master of Chinese
landscape art. For centuries, artists from around the world have
depicted what they see in God’s art gallery of creation: “The heavens
declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His handiwork” (Ps.
19:1). The Bible tells us that our creativity as human beings comes
from being made in the image of the Master Creator (Gen. 1:27).

God chose artists who worked with wood, gold, silver, bronze, and gems
to create the furnishings, utensils, altars, and garments that were to
be used when the ancient Israelites worshiped Him in the tabernacle 
(Ex. 31:1-11). These artistic renderings of spiritual realities
prompted and guided the priests and the people in their worship of the
Lord who had called them to be His people.

Through many types of artistic expression, we reflect the beauty of
creation and honor the Creator and Redeemer of this marvelous world.
