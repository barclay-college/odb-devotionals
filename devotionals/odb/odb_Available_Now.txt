I will never forget Your precepts, for by them You have given me life.

Psalm 119:93

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:89-96

The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the late 1940s, contain the oldest
known copies of the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament). For decades, the
scrolls have been carefully guarded and their use often restricted to
a small group of scholars. In an effort to preserve the ancient
fragments while broadening access to them, the Israel Antiquities
Authority, in partnership with Google, is making high-resolution
images of the 2,000-year-old scrolls available to everyone online.

That’s good news for scholars and curious students alike. It’s also a
reminder of the great treasure we currently possess in the Bible
itself. Throughout Psalm 119, the writer celebrates the eternal nature
and life-changing wisdom of God’s Word. At the heart of today’s
passage, the writer declares, “I will never forget Your precepts, for
by them You have given me life” (v.93).

Many of us have had a Bible almost all our lives, yet how much time do
we spend in reading and studying it? How deeply do we think about the
meaning of familiar passages?

Why not make Bible reading a priority each day? Ask God to guide,
teach, and strengthen you through His written Word. This amazing
resource is accessible to all and available now.
