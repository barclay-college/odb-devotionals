Just Like My Father

It is written: “Be holy, because I am holy.”
1 Peter 1:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 5:8–12

My father’s dusty, heeled-over, cowboy boots rest on the floor of my
study, daily reminders of the kind of man he was.

Among other things, he raised and trained cutting horses—equine
athletes that move like quicksilver. I loved to watch him at work,
marveling that he could stay astride.

As a boy, growing up, I wanted to be just like him. I’m in my
eighties, and his boots are still too large for me to fill.

My father’s in heaven now, but I have another Father to emulate. I
want to be just like Him—filled with His goodness, fragrant with His
love. I’m not there and never will be in this life; His boots are much
too large for me to fill.

But the apostle Peter said this: “The God of all grace, who called you
to his eternal glory in Christ . . . will himself restore you and make
you strong, firm and steadfast” (1 Peter 5:10). He has the wisdom and
power to do that, you know (v. 11).

Our lack of likeness to our heavenly Father will not last forever. God
has called us to share the beauty of character that is His. In this
life we reflect Him poorly, but in heaven our sin and sorrow will be
no more and we’ll reflect Him more fully! This is the “true grace of
God” (v. 12).

Reflect & Pray

Father God, we want to be just like You. Help us to grow more and more
like You each day!

Through the cross, believers are made perfect in His sight.
