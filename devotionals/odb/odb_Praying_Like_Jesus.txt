Praying Like Jesus

Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will,
but yours be done.
Luke 22:42

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 22:39–44

Every coin has two sides. The front is called “heads” and, from early
Roman times, usually depicts a country’s head of state. The back is
called “tails,” a term possibly originating from the British ten pence
depicting the raised tail of a heraldic lion.

Like a coin, Christ’s prayer in the garden of Gethsemane possesses two
sides. In the deepest hours of His life, on the night before He died
on a cross, Jesus prayed, “Father, if you are willing, take this cup
from me; yet not my will, but yours be done” (Luke 22:42). When
Christ says, “take this cup,” that’s the raw honesty of prayer. He
reveals His personal desire, “This is what I want.”

Then Jesus turns the coin, praying “not my will.” That’s the side of
abandon. Abandoning ourselves to God begins when we simply say, “But
what do You want, God?”

This two-sided prayer is also included in Matthew 26 and Mark 14 and
is mentioned in John 18. Jesus prayed both sides of prayer: take this
cup (what I want, God), yet not My will (what do You want, God?),
pivoting between them.

Two sides of Jesus. Two sides of prayer.

Reflect & Pray

What might we learn if we prayed honestly and with complete abandon,
as Jesus did? What situation are you facing right now where you can
pray honestly yet with abandon to God?

Father, help me follow the example of Your Son, who spent everything
so that I might possess real life that includes experiencing intimate
prayer with You.
