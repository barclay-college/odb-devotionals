For The Long Run

Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. —
James 5:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 5:7-11

A 2006 survey of more than 1,000 adults discovered that most people
take an average of 17 minutes to lose their patience while waiting in
line. Also, most people lose their patience in only 9 minutes while on
hold on the phone. Impatience is a common trait.

James wrote to a group of believers who were struggling with being
patient for Jesus’ return (James 5:7). They were living under
exploitation and distressing times, and James encouraged them to “set
the timer of their temper” for the long run. Challenging these
believers to persevere under suffering, he tried to stimulate them to
stand firm and to live sacrificially until the Lord returned to right
every wrong. He wrote: “Establish your hearts, for the coming of the
Lord is at hand” (v.8).

James called them to be like the farmer who waits patiently for the
rain and the harvest (v.7) and like the prophets and the patriarch Job
who demonstrated perseverance in difficulties (vv.10-11). The finish
line was just ahead and James encouraged the believers not to give up.

When we are being tried in a crucible of distress, God desires to help
us continue living by faith and trusting in His compassion and mercy
(v.11).

For Further Thought What is most difficult about being patient during
stressful times? Ask God for the grace to help you live by faith and
to live for the long run.

The way to great patience is through great trials.
