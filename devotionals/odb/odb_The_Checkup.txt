The Checkup

Search me, O God, . . . and see if there is any wicked way in me. —
Psalm 139:23-24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:17-24

It’s that time of year when I go to the doctor for my annual physical.
Even though I feel well and I’m not experiencing any health problems,
I know that routine checkups are important because they can uncover
hidden problems that if left undiscovered can grow to be serious
health issues. I know that giving permission to my doctor to find and
remedy the hidden problems can lead to long-term health.

Clearly the psalmist felt that way spiritually. Pleading for God to
search for hidden sin, he prayed, “Search me, O God, . . . and see if
there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting”
(Ps. 139:23-24). Pausing to give God the opportunity for a full and
unconditional inspection, he then surrendered to the righteous ways of
God that would keep him spiritually healthy.

So, even if you are feeling good about yourself, it is time for a
checkup! Only God knows the true condition of our heart, and only He
can forgive, heal, and lead us to a cleansed life and productive
future.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You know me better than I know myself. Search the deepest parts
of my heart for anything that is displeasing to You. Cleanse me of my
wandering ways and lead me in Your good and righteous way.

God’s work in us isn’t over when we receive salvation—it has just
begun.
