Because Of Love

[Mary] brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling
cloths, and laid Him in a manger. —
Luke 2:7

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:1-7

I received some nice Christmas gifts last year—ski pants, a bracelet,
and a Kindle reader. But what I enjoyed the most were the gifts of
time with people: playing with nine grandnephews and grandnieces from
out of state; having a niece and her husband and their 18-month-old
daughter attend our church’s Christmas Eve service with us; visiting
with a retired co-worker and his wife who are suffering with some
health issues; celebrating the season with long-time friends; reading
the Christmas story with loved ones. These were all special gifts
because of the love we share.

God the Father, because of love, sent a gift to this world 2,000 years
ago. Jesus was wrapped in swaddling cloths and laid in a manger (Luke
2:7). The shepherds knew He was an amazing gift because an angel
announced His birth to them in the middle of the night while they were
in their fields (vv.8-14). They rushed to see Him and then couldn’t
help but share the news of this Gift with others (vv.16-17). Yet many
later rejected Him, and He was crucified for our sins and buried. But
He rose from the tomb and now offers salvation to all who receive Him.

Thank You, God, for the Gift You gave—because of love.
