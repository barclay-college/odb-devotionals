No More; No Less

Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not
need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth. —
2 Timothy 2:15

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 2:14-26

Recently I was reading about how easy it is to mishandle the message
of the Bible. We may try to make it support what we already believe is
true instead of allowing it to speak to us with God’s intended
message. Some people use the Bible to defend one side of an issue,
while others use the Bible to attack that same issue. Both quote
Scripture to support their views, but both can’t be right.

It is important as we use God’s Word that we are committed to saying
no more and no less than the Scriptures actually say. If we mishandle
the Word, we misrepresent it, which ultimately misrepresents God’s
character. This is why Paul challenged Timothy, “Be diligent to
present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be
ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth” (2 Tim. 2:15). A key
priority for unashamed, approved workers for Christ is to accurately
interpret (“rightly divide”) God’s Word. As we study, we can depend on
the Spirit, who inspired it, to give us understanding and wisdom.

Through our words and actions, we have opportunity to represent God’s
Word in ways that genuinely reflect God’s heart. That is one of the
greatest privileges of the Christian life.
