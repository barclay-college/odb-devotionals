Worth the Calories?

If anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
Philippians 4:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:4–9

I love egg roti prata, a popular pancake in my country of Singapore.
So I was intrigued to read that a 125-pound (57 kg) person must run 5
miles (8 km) per hour for 30 minutes to burn 240 calories. That’s
equivalent to only one egg roti prata.

Ever since I started working out in the gym, those numbers have taken
on a new significance for me. I find myself asking: Is this food worth
the calories?

While it is wise to watch our food consumption, it is even more
important to watch our media consumption. Research shows that what we
see can stay in our minds for a long time and influence our behavior.
It has a “clingy effect,” sticking to us like that stubborn fat we
find so hard to lose.

With the wide variety of media content surrounding us today, we need
to be discerning consumers. That doesn’t mean we read only Christian
literature or watch only faith-related movies, but we are careful
about what we allow our eyes to see. We might ask ourselves: Is this
worth my time?

In Philippians 4:8, the apostle Paul tells us in essence, “Feed your
eyes and minds on things that are true, noble, just, pure, lovely, of
good report, virtuous and praiseworthy.” This is a “diet” worthy of
what Christ has done and is doing in us.

Reflect & Pray

Are my viewing habits enhancing my life or are they drawing me away
from things that really matter? Help me, Lord, to make wise choices.

The mind is formed by what it takes in.  Will Durant
