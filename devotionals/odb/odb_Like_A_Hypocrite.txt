Like A Hypocrite

God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love . . . made us
alive together with Christ. —
Ephesians 2:4-5

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 2:1-10

Ray Stedman told about a young man who had stopped attending the
church Ray was pastoring. The young man said that when he was at work
he would sometimes lose his temper and treat co-workers poorly. Then,
when Sunday rolled around, he didn’t want to go to church because he
felt like a hypocrite.

Stedman told his young friend, “A hypocrite is someone who acts like
something he isn’t. When you come to church, you are acting like a
Christian. You are not a hypocrite at church.” Suddenly, the young man
realized where he was being a hypocrite. He recognized that the answer
was not in avoiding church but in changing the way he was at work.

The term hypocrite is from a Greek word that means “play-actor.” It
means we pretend to be something we aren’t. Sometimes we forget our
true identity as believers in Jesus. We forget that we are accountable
to God. When we do that, we live the way we “once walked” (Eph. 2:2)
and thus are hypocrites.

Let’s not let our old ways make us act like someone we’re not.
Instead, through God’s grace, let’s live in a way that shows we are
“alive together with Christ” (v.5). That’s a sure cure for hypocrisy.

Reflect & Pray

Consistency! How much we need To walk a measured pace, To live the
life of which we speak, Until we see Christ’s face. —Anon.

It is the inconsistent Christian who helps the devil the most.
