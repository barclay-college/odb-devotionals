Creeping Christmas?

Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift! —
2 Corinthians 9:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 4:1-7

I love Christmas. The celebration of the birth of Christ and the
beauty and wonder of the season make it “the most wonderful time of
the year” for me. In recent years, however, the season has been
accompanied by a growing irritation. Every year “Christmas stuff”
comes out earlier and earlier—creeping all the way back to early fall.

Christmas used to be limited to December, but now we find radio
stations playing Christmas music in early November. Stores start
advertising Christmas specials in October, and Christmas candy appears
in late September. If we’re not careful, this growing deluge can numb
us—even sour us to what should be a season of gratitude and awe.

When that irritation begins to rise in my spirit, I try to do one
thing: Remember. I remind myself what Christmas means, who Jesus is,
and why He came. I remember the love and grace of a forgiving God who
sent us rescue in the Person of His Son. I remember that, ultimately,
only one gift really matters—God’s “indescribable gift!” (2 Cor.
9:15). I remember that the salvation Christ came to provide is both
the gift and the Giver all wrapped up in one.

Jesus is our life all year long, and He is the greatest wonder. “O
come, let us adore Him!”

Reflect & Pray

Living God, I thank You for the unspeakable gift of Your Son. Draw my
heart to Your own, that my worship to and gratitude for Your Son will
never be diminished by the distractions of the world around me.

Jesus is our life throughout the year.
