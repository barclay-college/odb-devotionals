The Best Wedding Ever

The marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself
ready. —
Revelation 19:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 21:1-8

Within the last 800 or so years, a new custom has been added to the
Jewish wedding ceremony. At the very end, the groom crushes a wine
glass under his foot. One explanation of this is that the shattering
of the glass symbolizes the destruction of the temple in ad 70. Young
couples are encouraged to remember, as they establish their own homes,
that God’s home had been destroyed.

God is not homeless, however. He has just chosen a new place to
live—in us, His followers. In the metaphors of Scripture, believers
are both the bride of Christ and the temple in which God lives. God is
fitting His people together to build a new home that will be His
permanent dwelling place. At the same time, He is preparing the bride
and planning a wedding that will include all of God’s family from the
beginning of time.

Our part is easy though sometimes painful. We cooperate with God as He
is at work in us to make us more like His Son Jesus. Then some day, at
the best wedding ever, our Lord will present us to Himself without
spot or wrinkle. We will be holy and without blemish (Eph. 5:27). This
wedding will bring an end to all sorrow and suffering.
