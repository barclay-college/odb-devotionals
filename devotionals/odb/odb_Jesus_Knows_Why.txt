Jesus Knows Why

When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at
his teaching.
Matthew 7:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 8:22–26

I have friends who’ve received partial healing but still struggle with
painful aspects of their diseases. Other friends have been healed of
an addiction but still struggle with feelings of inadequacy and self-
loathing. And I wonder, Why doesn’t God heal them completely—once and
for all?

In Mark 8:22–26, we read the story of Jesus healing a blind man. Jesus
first took the man away from the village. Then He spit on the man’s
eyes and “put his hands on him.” The man said he now saw people who
looked “like trees walking around.” Then Jesus touched the man’s eyes
again, and this time he saw “everything clearly.”

In His ministry, Jesus’s words and actions often amazed and baffled
the crowd and His followers (Matthew 7:28; Luke 8:10; 11:14) and even
drove many of them away (John 6:60–66). No doubt this two-part miracle
also caused confusion. Why not immediately heal this man?

We don’t know why. But Jesus knew what the man—and the disciples who
viewed his healing—needed in that moment. And He knows what we need
today to draw us closer in our relationship with Him. Though we won’t
always understand, we can trust that God is working in our lives and
the lives of our loved ones. And He will give us the strength,
courage, and clarity we need to persevere in following Him.
