What Brings Happiness?

All was vanity and grasping for the wind. There was no profit under
the sun. —
Ecclesiastes 2:11

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 2:1-11

After studying the effect of the post-World War II economic boom in
Japan, Richard Easterlin concluded that monetary growth does not
always bring more satisfaction. More recently, economists Betsey
Stevenson and Justin Wolfers conducted surveys in more than 100
nations and concluded that life satisfaction is highest in the richest
countries.

So who’s right? Let’s check with the writer of Ecclesiastes. He should
know! He was a truly rich man (2:8). He had the means to try
everything in this world—and he did! He gave himself to pleasure
(vv.1-3), grand projects (vv.4-8), entertainment (v.8), and hard work
(vv.10-11). But he concluded that it was all “vanity and grasping for
the wind. There was no profit under the sun” (v.11).

Lasting satisfaction doesn’t come from possessing tangible things like
savings accounts and material goods. Recent events have shown that
these things can suddenly lose value. To find true happiness, we have
to find it in Someone who is not from “under the sun.” And that is our
Savior, Jesus.

Hymnwriter Floyd Hawkins wrote: “I’ve discovered the way of gladness,
I’ve discovered the way of joy, I’ve discovered relief from sadness. .
. . When I found Jesus, my Lord.” Only He can give joy that is full
(John 15:11).

Reflect & Pray

Take the world, but give me Jesus, All its joys are but a name; But
His love abideth ever, Through eternal years the same. —Crosby

To know happiness, get to know Jesus.
