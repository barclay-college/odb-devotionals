Not One Sparrow

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his faithful
servants.
Psalm 116:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 10:28–33

My mother, so dignified and proper her entire life, now lay in a
hospice bed, held captive by debilitating age. Struggling for breath,
her declining condition contradicted the gorgeous spring day that
danced invitingly on the other side of the windowpane.

All the emotional preparation in the world cannot sufficiently brace
us for the stark reality of goodbye. Death is such an indignity! I
thought.

I diverted my gaze to the birdfeeder outside the window. A grosbeak
flitted close to help itself to some seed. Instantly a familiar phrase
popped into my mind: “Not a single sparrow can fall to the ground
without your Father knowing it” (Matt. 10:29 nlt). Jesus had said that
to His disciples as He gave them marching orders for a mission to
Judea, but the principle applies to all of us. “You are worth more
than many sparrows,” He told them (v. 31).

My mom stirred and opened her eyes. Reaching back to her childhood,
she used a Dutch term of endearment for her own mother and declared,
“Muti’s dead!”

“Yes,” my wife agreed. “She’s with Jesus now.” Uncertain, Mom
continued. “And Joyce and Jim?” she questioned of her sister and
brother. “Yes, they’re with Jesus too,” said my wife. “But we’ll be
with them soon!”

“It’s hard to wait,” Mom said quietly.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, this life can be so hard and painful. But You! . . .
You are right there with us, loving us, keeping us, holding us! And
You promise never to leave us or forsake us.

Death is the last shadow before heaven’s dawn.
