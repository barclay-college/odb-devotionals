The Careful Walk

See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise. —
Ephesians 5:15

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 5:1-17

One of my favorite places to visit in Jamaica is Ocho Rios, home of
Dunn’s River Falls—a spectacle that never ceases to amaze. Water
cascades down a long series of rocks as it makes its way to the
Caribbean Sea. Adventurers can climb the falls, scrambling over
rounded rocks on an invigorating trek to the top. The flowing water,
the potentially slippery surface, and the steep angles make the going
slow and a bit treacherous.

To make it safely to the top, climbers must watch every step. If a
person is not careful, he or she could fall on the journey. The keys
to a successful climb are concentration and caution.

I can’t think of a better picture of what Paul is saying in Ephesians
5:15 when he says, “walk circumspectly.” We should “be very careful .
. . how [we] live” (niv). Clearly, with all of life’s possible dangers
coming our way as we climb through life, it is vital that we take each
step with Jesus wisely and cautiously. A fool, the passage says, lives
carelessly; a wise person watches each step so he does not stumble or
fall.

Our goal of being “imitators of God” (v.1) is met, Paul says, as we
walk carefully in love (vv.2,15). Through the Holy Spirit’s guidance,
we can walk in a way that honors God.

Reflect & Pray

Consistency! How much we need To walk a measured pace, To live the
life of which we speak, Until we see Christ’s face. —Anon.

As we trust God to rule our hearts our feet can walk His way.
