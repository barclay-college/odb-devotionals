Would Or Did?

Christ died for our sins . . . , was buried, and . . . rose again the
third day according to the Scriptures. —
1 Corinthians 15:3-4

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 15:1-11

Not many years ago, we watched as the “WWJD” craze swept through the
Christian community. The bracelet-emblazoned theme “What Would Jesus
Do?” was a valuable reminder to many people that we should consider
the heart and mind of Jesus when making choices. As we seek to live in
a way that honors the Savior, it is appropriate to measure our
attitudes and decisions against the example our Lord set for us.

Recently, however, I was in a church where I saw a slightly different
message. This church’s sign read, “WDJD—What Did Jesus Do?” That is
indeed the more important question, because our salvation depends on
it. Paramount among the remarkable deeds of the Son of God are the
events described in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, “For I delivered to you
first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins
according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose
again the third day according to the Scriptures.”

What did Jesus do? He took the suffering and guilt for our wrongdoing
and paid our penalty. He died and conquered death so we could live.
And the fact is, we will never be able to fully consider what Jesus
would do until we have embraced what He did do for us on the cross.

Reflect & Pray

To follow Christ in all we do Can be a worthy goal If first we’ve put
our trust in Him To save our sinful soul. —Sper

We are saved not by what we do but by trusting what Christ has done.
