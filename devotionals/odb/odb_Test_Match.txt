Test Match

How long, Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my
precious life from these lions.
Psalm 35:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 35:17–28

A test match in the game of cricket can be grueling. Competitors play
from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. with lunch and tea breaks, but the games can
last up to five days. It’s a test of endurance as well as skill.

The tests we face in life are sometimes intensified for a similar
reason—they feel unending. The long search for a job, an unbroken
season of loneliness, or a lengthy battle with cancer is made even
more difficult by the fact that you wonder if it will ever end.

Perhaps that is why the psalmist cried out, “How long, Lord, will you
look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my precious life from these
lions” (Ps. 35:17). Bible commentaries say that this was speaking of
the long period in David’s life when he was pursued by Saul and
slandered by the king’s advisors—a time of trial that lasted for
years.

Yet, in the end, David sang, “The Lord be exalted, who delights in the
well-being of his servant” (v. 27). His testing drove him to deeper
trust in God—a trust that we can also experience in our own long
seasons of testing, hardship, or loss.

Reflect & Pray

As time drags on and answers seem faraway, teach me, Father, to find
my help in You and Your presence. Enable me to endure, and empower me
to trust in You.

When your burdens overwhelm you, remember that God has His arms
underneath you.
