Are You Being Prepared?

The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and . . . the bear
will rescue me.
1 Samuel 17:37

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Samuel 17:8, 32–37, 48–50

I worked at a fast-food restaurant for over two years in high school.
Some aspects of the job were difficult. Customers verbalized their
anger while I apologized for the unwanted slice of cheese on the
sandwich I didn’t make. Soon after I left, I applied for a computer
job at my university. The employers were more interested in my fast-
food experience than my computer skills. They wanted to know that I
knew how to deal with people. My experience in unpleasant
circumstances prepared me for a better job!

Young David persevered through an experience we might well call
unpleasant. When Israel was challenged to send someone to fight
Goliath, no one was brave enough to step up to the task. No one but
David. King Saul was reluctant to send him to fight, but David
explained that as a shepherd he had fought and killed a lion and a
bear for the sake of the sheep (1 Sam. 17:34–36). Confidently he
stated, “The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and . . .
the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine” (v. 37).

Being a shepherd didn’t earn David much respect, but it prepared him
to fight Goliath and eventually become Israel’s greatest king. We may
be in difficult circumstances, but through them God might be preparing
us for something greater!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to hold on during the unpleasant times in my life
knowing that You may be preparing me for something greater.

God uses present circumstances to prepare us for the future.
