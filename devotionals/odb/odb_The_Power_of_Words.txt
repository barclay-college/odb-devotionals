The Power of Words

Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it
will eat its fruit.
Proverbs 18:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 18:1-8, 20-21

Nelson Mandela, who opposed the South African apartheid regime and was
imprisoned for almost 3 decades, knew the power of words. He is often
quoted today, but while in prison his words could not be quoted for
fear of repercussion. A decade after his release he said: “It is never
my custom to use words lightly. If 27 years in prison have done
anything to us, it was to use the silence of solitude to make us
understand how precious words are, and how real speech is in its
impact on the way people live and die.”

King Solomon, author of most of the Old Testament book of Proverbs,
wrote often about the power of words. He said, “Death and life are in
the power of the tongue” (Prov. 18:21). Words have the potential to
produce positive or negative consequences (v. 20). They have the power
to give life through encouragement and honesty or to crush and kill
through lies and gossip. How can we be assured of producing good words
that have a positive outcome? The only way is by diligently guarding
our hearts: “Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do
flows from it” (4:23 niv).

Jesus can transform our hearts so that our words can truly be their
best—honest, calm, appropriate, and suitable for the situation.

Reflect & Pray

Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable
in Your sight, O Lord , my strength and my Redeemer. Psalm 19:14

Our words have the power to build up or tear down.
