Paradogs

In You do I trust; cause me to know the way in which I should walk.
Psalm 143:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 143:7-12

I am amazed by the story of the World War II paradogs. In preparing
for D-Day (June 6, 1944), the Allied troops needed the sharp senses of
dogs to sniff their way through minefields and to warn troops of
approaching danger. And the only way to get these dogs to troops
behind enemy lines was by parachute. But dogs are instinctively afraid
of doing this—and let’s be honest, they are not alone. Yet after weeks
of training, the dogs learned to trust their masters enough to jump at
their command.

I wonder if any of us trust our Master enough to do challenging things
we would never instinctively do or things that might make us fearful.
We may not be instinctively generous or forgiving or patient with
those who annoy us. Yet Jesus commands us to trust Him enough to do
things that may be difficult but that will advance His kingdom. To
say, “In You do I trust; cause me to know the way in which I should
walk” (Ps. 143:8 nkjv).

Paradogs often received medals for their bravery. I believe we too
will someday hear “well done” because we have trusted our Master
enough to jump when He said, “Go!”

Reflect & Pray

Is God asking you to do something that you are afraid to do? Will you
trust Him to lead you and walk with you?

Trust Jesus to show you how you can be used by Him.
