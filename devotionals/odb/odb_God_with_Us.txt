God with Us

The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call
him Immanuel.
Matthew 1:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 1:18–23

“Christ with me, Christ before me, Christ behind me, Christ within me,
Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ at my right, Christ at my
left . . .” These hymn lyrics, written by the fifth-century Celtic
Christian St. Patrick, echo in my mind when I read Matthew’s account
of Jesus’s birth. They feel like a warm embrace, reminding me that I’m
never alone.

Matthew’s account tells us that God dwelling with His people is at the
heart of Christmas. Quoting Isaiah’s prophecy of a child who would be
called Immanuel, meaning “God with us” (Isa. 7:14), Matthew points to
the ultimate fulfillment of that prophecy—Jesus, the One born by the
power of the Holy Spirit to be God with us. This truth is so central
that Matthew begins and ends his gospel with it, concluding with
Jesus’s words to His disciples: “And surely I am with you always, to
the very end of the age” (Matt. 28:20).

St. Patrick’s lyrics remind me that Christ is with believers always
through His Spirit living within. When I’m nervous or afraid, I can
hold fast to His promises that He will never leave me. When I can’t
fall asleep, I can ask Him to give me His peace. When I’m celebrating
and filled with joy, I can thank Him for His gracious work in my life.

Jesus, Immanuel—God with us.
