Is Somebody Singing?

[Bear] with one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace. —
Ephesians 4:2-3

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 17:20-26

From 200 miles above Earth, Chris Hadfield, Canadian astronaut and
commander of the International Space Station, joined in song with a
group of students in a studio on Earth. Together they performed “Is
Somebody Singing,” co-written by Hadfield and Ed Robertson.

One phrase of the song caught my attention: “You can’t make out
borders from up here.” Although we humans draw many lines to separate
ourselves from one another—national, ethnic, ideological—the song
reminded me that God doesn’t see such distinctions. The important
thing to God is that we love Him and each other (Mark 12:30-31).

Like a loving father, God wants His family united. We cannot
accomplish what God has for us to do if we refuse to be reconciled
with one another. In His most impassioned prayer, on the night before
He was crucified, Jesus pleaded with God to unite His followers: “That
they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that
they also may be one in Us” (John 17:21).

Singing illustrates unity as we agree on the lyrics, chords, and
rhythms. Singing can also promote unity as it binds us together in
peace, proclaims God’s power through praise, and demonstrates God’s
glory to the world.

Reflect & Pray

O for a thousand tongues to sing My great Redeemer’s praise, The
glories of my God and King, The triumphs of His grace. —Wesley

Singing God’s praises will never go out of style.
