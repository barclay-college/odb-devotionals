All Year Long

[The Lord said], "Is this not the fast that I have chosen: . . . Is it
not to share your bread with the hungry?" —
Isaiah 58:6-7

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 58:6-12

During Lent (the 40 days prior to Easter) many Christians follow the
practice of giving up something and taking the time to reflect on
Jesus’ sacrifice of Himself for us.

One group of middle-class believers in a church in the UK decided to
live on the minimum wage. Their goal was to identify with those who
live on little, to learn the joy of giving, to invite God to change
their attitude toward money, and to challenge others in their church
to do the same. For their study they chose Isaiah 58.

Afterward, one of the leaders of the group said they learned an
important lesson. Living on less “makes you realize just how much you
really can give away. It makes you look at what you normally give and
realize that it is far from being sacrificial.”

What they learned agrees with God’s idea of what fasting and
sacrificial living are all about. The Lord said to Israel, “Is this
not the fast that I have chosen: . . . Is it not to share your bread
with the hungry, and that you bring to your house the poor who are
cast out?” (Isaiah 58:6-7). God was chiding His people because their
fasting had become an empty ritual with no concern for others.

Let’s give sacrificially to others—not just during Lent but all year
long.

Reflect & Pray

Grant us, then, the grace for giving With a spirit large and free,
That our life and all our living We may consecrate to Thee. —Murray

Your standard of giving is more important than your standard of
living.
