Smile!

The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you. —
Numbers 6:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Numbers 6:22-27

A recent study that I read concluded that smiling can be good for your
health. Research shows that smiling slows down the heart and reduces
stress.

But smiling isn’t just good for you; a genuine smile blesses those on
the receiving end as well. Without saying a word, it can tell others
that you like them and that you are pleased with them. A smile can hug
someone with love without giving them even the slightest touch.

Life does not always give us a reason to smile. But when we see a
heartfelt smile on a child’s face or through aged wrinkles, our hearts
are encouraged.

Smiles are also a hint of the image of God in us. In the ancient
blessing recorded in the book of Numbers we get an indication that God
“smiles”: “The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to
you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace”
(Num. 6:25-26). Those words are a Hebrew idiom for the favor of God on
a person’s life, asking God to smile on His children.

So today, remember that you are loved by God, and that He is pleased
to be gracious to you and to shine His face upon you.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, may my life be so pleasing to You that You are pleased to have
Your face shine on me. And as You graciously smile on my life, may I
find someone today with whom I can share Your love through a smile.

Your smile could be a message of cheer from God to a needy soul.
