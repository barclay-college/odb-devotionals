Friends In The Night

The soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved
him as his own soul. —
1 Samuel 18:1

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 20:30-42

Do you have someone you could call in the middle of the night if you
needed help? Bible teacher Ray Pritchard calls these people “2 a.m.
friends.” If you have an emergency, this kind of friend would ask you
two questions: “Where are you?” and “What do you need?”

Friends like that are crucial during difficult times. Jonathan was
that type of friend for David. Jonathan’s father, King Saul—who was
filled with envy at David’s popularity and God’s blessing on him—tried
to kill him (1 Sam. 19:9-10). David escaped and asked his friend for
help (ch. 20). While David hid in the field, Jonathan sat at dinner
with his father and quickly realized that Saul did indeed intend to
kill David (vv.24-34).

Because of their deep friendship, Jonathan “was grieved for David”
(v.34). He warned him of his father’s plan and told him he should
leave (vv.41-42). David recognized what a good friend he had in
Jonathan. The Bible says they wept together, “but David more so”
(v.41). Their souls were “knit” together.

Do you have loving Christian friends you can count on in a crisis? Are
you someone your friends would call a “2 a.m. friend”?

Thank God for you, good friend of mine, Seldom is friendship such as
thine; How very much I wish to be As helpful as you’ve been to me.

A true friend stands with us in times of trial.
