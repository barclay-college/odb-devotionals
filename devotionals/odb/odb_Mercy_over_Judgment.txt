Mercy over Judgment

Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that
gives freedom.
James 2:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 2:1–13

When my children were squabbling and came to me to tattle on one
another, I took each child aside separately to hear their account of
the problem. Since both were guilty, at the end of our chat I asked
them each what they felt would be an appropriate, fair consequence for
their sibling’s actions. Both suggested swift punishment for the
other. To their surprise, I instead gave them each the consequence
they had intended for their sibling. Suddenly, each child lamented how
“unfair” the sentence seemed now that it was visited upon them—despite
having deemed it appropriate when it was intended for the other.

My kids had shown the kind of “judgment without mercy” that God warns
against (James 2:13). James reminds us that instead of showing
favoritism to the wealthy, or even to one’s self, God desires that we
love others as we love ourselves (v. 8). Instead of using others for
selfish gain, or disregarding anyone whose position doesn’t benefit
us, James instructs us to act as people who know how much we’ve been
given and forgiven—and to extend that mercy to others.

God has given generously of His mercy. In all our dealings with
others, let’s remember the mercy He’s shown us and extend it to
others.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I’m grateful for the great mercy You’ve shown me. Help me to
offer similar mercy to others as a measure of my gratitude to You.

God’s mercy prompts us to be merciful.
