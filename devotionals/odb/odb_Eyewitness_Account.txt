Eyewitness Account

Truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
—
1 John 1:3

Today's Scripture: 1 John 1

When the Day of Discovery television crew interviews people for a
biography, we especially enjoy talking with those who knew the person
whose life-story we are telling. Over the years, we’ve talked with a
man who roomed with Eric Liddell in an internment camp in China; a
woman who as a teenager lived in the home of C. S. Lewis during World
War II; and a man who chauffeured Dr. George Washington Carver on a
speaking tour throughout the southern US. They all spoke freely and
openly about the special person they knew.

When John, one of Jesus’ 12 disciples, was an old man, he wrote a
letter in which his opening words established him as an eyewitness and
close companion of Jesus: “The life was manifested, and we have seen,
and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with
the Father and was manifested to us” (1 John 1:2). His goals in
writing were “that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our
fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ” (v.3) and
“that your joy may be full” (v.4).

The eyewitness accounts of Jesus’ disciples help lead us to faith in
Christ. Even though we have not seen Him as they did, we have
believed.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, for the reliable eyewitness accounts of Jesus’ life
that we can read in Your Word. And thank You for people in our lives
who know Him. They help us believe too.

Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed. — Jesus
