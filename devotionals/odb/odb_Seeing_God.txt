Seeing God

Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for
us.”
John 14:8

Today's Scripture: John 14:1–12

Author and pastor Erwin Lutzer recounts a story about television show
host Art Linkletter and a little boy who was drawing a picture of God.
Amused, Linkletter said, “You can’t do that because nobody knows what
God looks like.”

“They will when I get through!” the boy declared.

We may wonder, What is God like? Is He good? Is He kind? Does He care?
The simple answer to those questions is Jesus’s response to Philip’s
request: “Lord, show us the Father.” Jesus replied, “Don’t you know
me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone
who has seen me has seen the Father” (John 14:8–9).

If you ever get hungry to see God, look at Jesus. “The Son is the
image of the invisible God,” said Paul (Col. 1:15). Read through the
four gospels in the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
Think deeply about what Jesus did and said. “Draw” your own mental
picture of God as you read. You’ll know much more of what He’s like
when you’re through.

A friend of mine once told me that the only God he could believe in is
the one he saw in Jesus. If you look closely, I think you’ll agree. As
you read about Him your heart will leap, for though you may not know
it, Jesus is the God you’ve been looking for all your life.

Reflect & Pray

We’re so prone, Lord, to want You to be something You are not. Help us
to see You more clearly on the pages of Scripture. Help us reflect
Your Son in our lives. How do you see God? Submit your own artwork or

The clearer we see God, the clearer we see ourselves.  Erwin Lutzer
