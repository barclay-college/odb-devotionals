Wise Aid

Encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.
1 Thessalonians 5:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:12–15

As I stopped my car at a red light, I saw the same man standing beside
the road again. He held a cardboard sign: Need money for food.
Anything helps. I looked away and sighed. Was I the kind of person who
ignored the needy?

Some people pretend to have needs but are actually con artists. Others
have legitimate needs but face difficulties overcoming destructive
habits. Social workers tell us it’s better to give money to the aid
ministries in our city. I swallowed hard and drove past. I felt bad,
but I may have acted wisely.

God commands us to “warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage
the disheartened, help the weak” (1 Thessalonians 5:14). To do this
well we must know who belongs in which category. If we warn a weak or
disheartened person, we may break her spirit; if we help an idle
person, we may encourage laziness. Consequently, we help best from up
close, when we know the person well enough to know what he needs.

Has God burdened your heart to help someone? Great! Now the work
begins. Don’t assume you know what that person needs. Ask her to share
her story, and listen. Prayerfully give as seems wise and not merely
to feel better. When we truly aim “to do what is good for each other,”
we will more readily “be patient with everyone,” even when they
stumble (vv. 14–15).

Reflect & Pray

When have others most helped you? What did you learn about how best to
help others?

Father, help me to help wisely, and often.
