Before the Phone

In my distress I called to the Lord.
Psalm 18:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 18:1-6

As a mom of young children I’m sometimes susceptible to panic. My
first reaction is to call my mom on the phone and ask her what to do
with my son’s allergy or my daughter’s sudden cough.

Mom is a great resource, but when I read the Psalms, I’m reminded of
how often we need the kind of help that no mortal can give. In Psalm
18 David was in great danger. Afraid, close to death, and in anguish,
he called on the Lord.

David could say, “I love you, Lord” because he understood God was a
fortress, a rock, and a deliverer (vv. 1-2). God was his shield, his
salvation, and his stronghold. Maybe we cannot understand David’s
praise because we have not experienced God’s help. It may be that we
reach for the phone before going to God for advice and help.

Surely God puts people in our lives to give us help and comfort. But
let’s also remember to pray. God will hear us. As David sang, “From
his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears”
(v. 6). When we go to God, we join David’s song and enjoy Him as our
rock, our fortress, and our deliverer.

Next time you reach for the phone, remember also to pray.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me to remember You are my deliverer, and You always
hear my cry.

Prayer is the bridge between panic and peace.
