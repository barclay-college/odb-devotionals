The Other Side

What is your life? It is even a vapor. —
James 4:14

Today's Scripture: James 4:13-17

When someone said to my friend, “See you in a year,” it sounded odd
when he replied, “Yes, see you on the other side.” He meant that he’d
see him on the other side of a one-year deployment for the US Navy.
But because the phrase is often used of heaven, it made me think about
the uncertainty of life. I wondered, Who will be here in another year?
Who might by then be on the other side—in heaven?

We certainly don’t know what the next year—or hour—will bring. In his
epistle, James wrote about this uncertainty. He rebuked the greedy
merchants for boasting about what they would do that day, the next
day, or even the next year (4:13). Their sin wasn’t that they were
making plans; it was forgetting God and arrogantly boasting about
those business plans.

James reminded them: “What is your life? It is even a vapor that
appears for a little time and then vanishes away” (v.14). Commentator
Peter Davids says that James was pointing out their foolishness and
saying, in essence, “Come now, you who make plans—you don’t even
understand how little control you have over life itself.”

No part of life is outside the control of God. So when we make plans,
we need to remember, “If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or
that” (v.15).

Reflect & Pray

Tomorrow’s plans I do not know, I only know this minute; But He will
say, “This is the way, By faith now walk ye in it.” —Ryberg

Write your plans in pencil and let God have the eraser.
