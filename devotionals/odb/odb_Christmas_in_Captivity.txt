Christmas in Captivity

On those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned.
Isaiah 9:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 9:1–7

Rev. Martin Niemoller, a prominent German pastor, spent nearly eight
years in Nazi concentration camps because he openly opposed Hitler. On
Christmas Eve 1944, Niemoller spoke these words of hope to his fellow
prisoners in Dachau:  “My dear friends, on this Christmas . . . let us
seek, in the Babe of Bethlehem, the One who came to us in order to
bear with us everything that weighs heavily upon us. . . . God Himself
has built a bridge from Himself to us! A dawn from on high has visited
us!”

At Christmas we embrace the good news that God, in Christ, has come to
us wherever we are and has bridged the gap between us. He invades our
prison of darkness with His light and lifts the load of sorrow, guilt,
or loneliness that weighs us down.

On that bleak Christmas Eve in prison, Niemoller shared this good
news:  “Out of the brilliance that surrounded the shepherds a shining
ray will fall into our darkness.” His words remind us of the prophet
Isaiah, who prophetically said, “The people walking in darkness have
seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a
light has dawned” (Isa. 9:2).

No matter where today finds us, Jesus has penetrated our dark world
with His joy and light!

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, we find hope and strength in knowing that Your light
shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

The joy of Christmas is Jesus.
