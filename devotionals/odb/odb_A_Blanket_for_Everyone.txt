A Blanket for Everyone

Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a
multitude of sins.
1 Peter 4:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 18:15–27

Linus Van Pelt, better known as simply “Linus,” was a mainstay in the
Peanuts comic strip. Witty and wise, yet insecure, Linus constantly
carried a security blanket. We can identify. We have our fears and
insecurities too.

The disciple Peter knew something about fear. When Jesus was arrested,
Peter displayed courage by following the Lord into the courtyard of
the high priest. But then he began to show his fear by lying to
protect his identity (John 18:15–26). He spoke disgraceful words that
denied his Lord. But Jesus never stopped loving Peter and ultimately
restored him (see John 21:15–19).

Peter’s emphasis on love in 1 Peter 4:8 came from one who had
experienced the deep love of Jesus. And he, in turn, stressed the
importance of love in our relationships with the words “above all.”
The intensity of the verse continues with the encouragement to “love
each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.”

Have you ever needed that kind of “blanket”? I have! After saying or
doing something I later regretted, I have felt the chilly draft of
guilt and shame. I have needed to be “covered” in the manner that
Jesus covered disgraced, shame-filled people in the Gospels.

To followers of Jesus, love is a blanket to be graciously and
courageously given away for the comfort and reclamation of others. As
recipients of such great love, let us be givers of the same.
