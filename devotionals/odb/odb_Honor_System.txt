Honor System

He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he
who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much. —
Luke 16:10

Today's Scripture: Luke 16:1-10

Many homes near ours offer produce and perennials for sale by the
road. Sometimes we’ll drive up to an unattended stand that operates on
the “honor system.” As we make our selection, we put our money into a
cash box or an old coffee can. Then we go home to enjoy the freshly
picked fruits and vegetables.

But the honor system doesn’t always work. My friend Jackie has a
flower stand in front of her house. One day, as she glanced out her
window she saw a well-dressed woman with a big hat loading pots of
perennials into the trunk of her car. Jackie smiled as she mentally
calculated a $50 profit from her labors in the garden. But when she
checked the cash box later, it was empty! The honor system revealed
that this woman was not honorable.

Perhaps to her, taking the flowers seemed like a small thing. But
being honest in little things indicates how we will respond in the big
things (Luke 16:10). Honesty in all areas of our lives is one way we
can bring honor to Jesus Christ, our Savior.

The best “honor system” for a follower of Christ is Colossians 3:17,
“Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus.”

Reflect & Pray

Give of your best to the Master; Give Him first place in your heart;
Give Him first place in your service, Consecrate every part. —Grose

Honesty means never having to look over your shoulder.
