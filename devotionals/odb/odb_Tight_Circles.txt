Tight Circles

It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.
Galatians 5:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 5:1, 4–14

A classmate gave my family a registered collie that had become too old
to breed puppies. We soon learned this beautiful dog had, sadly, spent
much of her life inside a small pen. She would only walk in tight
circles. She couldn’t fetch or run in a straight line. And even with a
large yard in which to play, she thought she was fenced in.

The first Christians, many who were Jews, were used to being fenced in
by the Mosaic law. Though the law was good and had been given by God
to convict them of sin and lead them to Jesus (Galatians 3:19–25), it
was time to live out their new faith based in God’s grace and the
freedom of Christ. They hesitated. After all this time, were they
really free?

We may have the same problem. Perhaps we grew up in churches with
rigid rules that fenced us in. Or we were raised in permissive homes
and are now desperate for the security of rules. Either way, it’s time
to embrace our freedom in Christ (Galatians 5:1). Jesus has freed us
to obey Him out of love (John 14:21) and to “serve one another humbly
in love” (Galatians 5:13). An entire field of joy and love is open for
those who realize “if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed”
(John 8:36).

Reflect & Pray

How have you been kept from experiencing freedom in Christ? How can
realizing this freedom help you serve others?

Jesus, help me to believe I am as free as You say.
