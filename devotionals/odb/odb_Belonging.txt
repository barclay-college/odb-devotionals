Belonging

In my Father’s house are many mansions . . . . I go to prepare a place
for you. —
John 14:2

Today's Scripture: John 14:1-11

My dad was full of stories about his hometown. So you can imagine how
excited I was as a child when he took our family there every summer.
We fished the St. Joseph River together and visited his boyhood farm
where all of his stories came to life. Although that place was never
really my home, whenever I visit that town—now with grown children and
grandchildren of my own—it fills me with a nostalgic sense of
belonging.

Jesus talked with His disciples about His home in heaven, which He
left to come and live among us. What a joy it must have been for Him
to tell His disciples, “In my Father’s house are many mansions . . . .
I go to prepare a place for you, . . . that where I am, there you may
be also” (John 14:2-3). No doubt Jesus, “who for the joy that was set
before Him endured the cross” (Heb. 12:2), was looking forward to
returning to His heavenly home and taking His Father’s sons and
daughters there to be with Him.

The thought of Jesus taking us to His Father’s home fills us with
great anticipation and compels us to tell others the good news about
the Son who came to rescue us from this fallen place.
