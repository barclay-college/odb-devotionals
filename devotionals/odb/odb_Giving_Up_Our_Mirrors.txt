Giving Up Our Mirrors

[Bezalel] made the laver of bronze and its base of bronze, from the
bronze mirrors of the serving women. —
Exodus 38:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:1-5

When Moses gathered the children of Israel together to begin work on
the tabernacle (Ex. 35–39), he called on Bezalel, a gifted artisan, to
help make the furnishings. We’re told that certain women were asked to
give their precious bronze mirrors to make the bronze basin he was
constructing (38:8). They gave them up to help prepare a place where
God’s presence would reside.

Give up our mirrors? For most of us, that would be hard to do. That’s
not something we’re asked to do, but it makes me think about how too
much scrutiny and self-examination can be disconcerting. It can make
us think too much about ourselves and not enough about others.

When we can forget about our own faces quickly and remember that God
loves us as we are—in all our imperfections—then we can begin to “look
out not only for [our] own interests, but also for the interests of
others” (Phil. 2:4).

Augustine said that we get lost in loving ourselves but found in
loving others. Put another way, the secret of happiness is not getting
our face right but giving our hearts away, giving our lives away,
giving our selves away, in love.

Reflect & Pray

Father, may I think more of others today than I think of myself. May I
lose my thoughts about myself in my thoughts of other people and their
needs.

A heart that is focused on others will not be consumed with self.
