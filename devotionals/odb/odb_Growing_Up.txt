Growing Up

From him the whole body . . . grows and builds itself up in love.
Ephesians 4:16

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 4:1-16

Watching my young grandson and his friends play T-Ball is
entertaining. In this version of baseball, young players often run to
the wrong base or don’t know what to do with the ball if they happen
to catch it.  If we were watching a professional baseball game, these
mistakes would not be so funny.

It’s all a matter of maturity.

It’s okay for young athletes to struggle—not knowing what to do or not
getting everything exactly right. They are trying and learning. So we
coach them and patiently guide them toward maturity. Then we celebrate
their success as later they play with skill as a team.

Something similar happens in the life of those who follow Jesus. Paul
pointed out that the church needs people who will “be patient, bearing
with one another in love” (Eph. 4:2). And we need a variety of
“coaches” (pastors, teachers, spiritual mentors) to help us all move
toward “unity in the faith” as we strive to “become mature” (v. 13).

The goal as we listen to preaching and teaching and enjoy life
together in the church is to grow up to maturity in Christ (v. 15).
Each of us is on this journey, and we can encourage each other on the
road to maturity in Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to strive for maturity. Thank You for equipping the
church with men and women who can help me grow in my faith. Show me
who I can encourage today.

There’s joy in the journey as we walk alongside each other.
