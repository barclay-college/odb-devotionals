Ready for a Change?

But the fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control.
Galatians 5:22–23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 5:16–25

Self-control is probably one of the hardest things to master. How
often have we been defeated by a bad habit, a lousy attitude, or a
wrong mindset? We make promises to improve. We ask someone to hold us
accountable. But deep inside, we know that we don’t have the will or
the ability to change. We can talk, we can plan, we can read self-help
books, but we still find it difficult to overcome and control many of
the things that are inside us!

Thankfully, God knows our weakness, and He also knows the remedy! The
Bible says, “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control” (Gal.
5:22–23). The only way to gain self-control is by allowing the Holy
Spirit to control us.

In other words, our key focus is not effort but surrender—to live
moment by moment submissively trusting in the Lord rather than in
self. Paul says this is what it means to “walk by the Spirit” (v. 16).

Are you ready for a change? You can change, for God is in you. As you
surrender control to Him, He will help you bear the fruit of His
likeness.

Reflect & Pray

I am in need, Lord, of Your power so that I might change and grow. I
surrender myself to You. Please help me to understand how to be
submissive to You that I might be filled with Your Spirit.

God is not nearly as concerned with our ability as He is with our
surrender.
