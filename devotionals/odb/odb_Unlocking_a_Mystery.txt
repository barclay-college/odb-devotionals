Unlocking a Mystery

This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs
together with Israel.
Ephesians 3:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 3:1–12

When I came home from work one day and saw a pair of lady’s high-heel
shoes next to the driveway, I was sure I knew whose they were. So I
put them in the garage to give to my daughter Lisa when she returned
to the house to pick up her children. But when I checked with Lisa, I
found they didn’t belong to her. In fact, no one in our family claimed
them, so I put them back where I’d found them. The next day, they were
gone. Mysterious.

Did you know that the apostle Paul wrote of a mystery in his letters?
But the mystery he described was so much more than some kind of
“whodunit.” In Ephesians 3, for example, Paul spoke of a mystery that
“was not made known to people in other generations” (v. 5). This
mystery is that, while in the past God revealed Himself through
Israel, now, through Jesus, Gentiles—those outside of Israel—could be
“heirs together with Israel” (v. 6).

Think about what this means: all who trust Jesus as Savior can love
and serve God together. We can all equally “approach [Him] with
freedom and confidence” (v. 12). And through the church’s unity the
world will see God’s wisdom and goodness (v. 10).

Praise God for our salvation. It unlocks for us the mystery of unity
as people of any and all backgrounds become one in Jesus.
