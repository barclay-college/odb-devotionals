“Because You Prayed”

Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer
and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
Philippians 4:6

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 37:9–22, 33

What do you do with your worries? Do you turn them inward, or turn
them upward?

When the brutal Assyrian King Sennacherib was preparing to destroy
Jerusalem, he sent a message to King Hezekiah saying that Judah would
be no different from all the other nations he had conquered. Hezekiah
took this message to the temple in Jerusalem, and “spread it out
before the Lord” (Isa. 37:14). He then prayed and asked for help from
Almighty God.

Soon afterward Isaiah the prophet delivered this message to Hezekiah
from the Lord: “Because you prayed about King Sennacherib of Assyria,
the Lord has spoken” (Isa. 37:21–22 nlt). Scripture tells us that
Hezekiah’s prayer was answered that very night. God intervened
miraculously, conquering the enemy forces outside the city gates. The
Assyrian army didn’t even “shoot an arrow” (v. 33). Sennacherib would
leave Jerusalem, never to return.

Three words in God’s message to Hezekiah—“Because you prayed”—show us
the best place to go with our worries. Because Hezekiah turned to God,
He rescued him and his people. When we turn our worries into prayer,
we discover that God is faithful in unexpected ways!

Reflect & Pray

Father, please help me to turn my worries into prayer. My problems are
better in Your hands than in my own.

Prayer moves the hand that moves the world.  E.M. Bounds
