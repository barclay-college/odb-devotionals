A Forever Hello

He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given
us the Spirit. —
2 Corinthians 5:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 4:16–5:8

After a week’s vacation with her daughter and 4-month-old grandson,
Oliver, Kathy had to say goodbye until she could see them again. She
wrote to me saying, “Sweet reunions like we had make my heart long for
heaven. There, we won’t have to try to capture memories in our mind.
There, we won’t have to pray for the time to go slowly and the days to
last long. There, our hello will never turn into goodbye. Heaven will
be a ‘forever hello,’ and I can’t wait.” As a first-time grandma, she
wants to be with her grandson Oliver as much as possible! She’s
thankful for any time she can be with him and for the hope of
heaven—where the wonderful moments will never end.

Our good days do seem too short, and our difficult days far too long.
But both kinds of days cause us to long for even better days ahead.
The apostle Paul said that he and the Corinthians longed to be
“clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal
may be swallowed up by life” (2 Cor. 5:4 niv). Although the Lord is
with us in this life, we cannot see Him face to face. Now we live by
faith, not by sight (v.7).

God made us for the very purpose of being near to Him always (v.5).
Heaven will be a forever hello.

Reflect & Pray

Face to face—O blissful moment! Face to face—to see and know; Face to
face with my Redeemer, Jesus Christ who loves me so! —Breck

Now we see Jesus in the Bible, but then, face to face.
