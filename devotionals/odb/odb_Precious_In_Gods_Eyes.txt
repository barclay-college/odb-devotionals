Precious In God’s Eyes

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints. —
Psalm 116:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 116

In response to the news that a mutual friend of ours had died, a wise
brother who knew the Lord sent me these words, “Precious in the sight
of the Lord is the death of His saints” (Ps. 116:15). Our friend’s
vibrant faith in Jesus Christ was the dominant characteristic of his
life, and we knew he was home with God in heaven. His family had that
assurance as well, but I had been focused only on their sorrow. And
it’s appropriate to consider others during their grief and loss.

But the verse from Psalms turned my thoughts to how the Lord saw the
passing of our friend. Something “precious” is something of great
value. Yet, there is a larger meaning here. There is something in the
death of a saint that transcends our grief over their absence.

“Precious (important and no light matter) in the sight of the Lord is
the death of His saints (His loving ones)” (The Amplified Bible).
Another paraphrase says, “His loved ones are very precious to him and
he does not lightly let them die” (The Living Bible). God is not
flippant toward death. The marvel of His grace and power is that, as
believers, our loss of life on earth also brings great gain.

Today we have only a glimpse. One day we’ll understand it in the
fullness of His light.

So when my last breath Shall rend the veil in twain By death I shall
escape from death And life eternal gain. —Montgomery

Faith builds a bridge across the gulf of death.
