Empty Fort Strategy

Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too
hard for Me? —
Jeremiah 32:27

Today's Scripture: Judges 7:2-8

In the Chinese historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, author
Luo Guanzhong describes the “Empty Fort Strategy,” a use of reverse
psychology to deceive the enemy. When 150,000 troops from the Wei
Kingdom reached Xicheng, which had less than 2,500 soldiers, they
found the city gate wide open and the famous military tactician Zhuge
Liang calmly playing the zither with two children beside him. The Wei
general, baffled by the scene and believing it was an ambush, ordered
a full retreat.

The Bible offers another example of a bewildering battle strategy. In
Judges 7, God had Gideon use 300 men, horns, jars, and blazing torches
against armies that were “as numerous as locusts; and their camels
were without number” (v.12).

Could Israel defeat such a formidable foe? It was humanly impossible!
They had neither the manpower nor the military hardware. But they had
one thing that worked for them and that was all they needed. They had
God’s promise: “With these 300 men I will rescue you and give you
victory” (v.7 nlt). The result? Victory!

Are you facing a formidable challenge? The Lord has said, “Behold, I
am the Lord, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?”
(Jer. 32:27).
