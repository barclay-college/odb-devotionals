Harvest and Thanksgiving

Celebrate the Festival of Harvest with the firstfruits of the crops
you sow in your field.
Exodus 23:16

Today's Scripture: Genesis 8:15–9:3

Several thousand years ago, God spoke directly to Moses and instituted
a new festival for His people. In Exodus 23:16, according to Moses’s
record, God said, “Celebrate the Festival of Harvest with the
firstfruits of the crops you sow in your field.”

Today countries around the world do something similar by celebrating
the land’s bounty. In Ghana, the people celebrate the Yam Festival as
a harvest event. In Brazil, Dia de Acao de Gracas is a time to be
grateful for the crops that yielded their food. In China, there is the
Mid-Autumn (Moon) Festival. In the United States and Canada:
Thanksgiving.

To understand the fitting goal of a harvest celebration, we visit Noah
right after the flood. God reminded Noah and his family—and us—of His
provision for our flourishing existence on the earth. Earth would have
seasons, daylight and darkness and “seedtime and harvest” (Gen. 8:22).
Our gratitude for the harvest, which sustains us, goes to God alone.

No matter where you live or how you celebrate your land’s bounty, take
time today to express gratitude to God—for we would have no harvest to
celebrate without His grand creative design.
