Expect Delays

In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes
their steps.
Proverbs 16:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 16:1–3, 9

Are you kidding me? I was already late. But the road sign ahead
instructed me to adjust my expectations: “Expect Delays,” it
announced. Traffic was slowing down.

I had to laugh: I expect things to work on my ideal timeline; I don’t
expect road construction.

On a spiritual level, few of us plan for crises that slow us down or
reroute our lives. Yet, if I think about it, I can recall many times
when circumstances redirected me—in big ways and small. Delays happen.

Solomon never saw a sign that said, “Expect Delays.” But in Proverbs
16, he does contrast our plans with God’s providential guidance. The
Message paraphrases verse 1 as follows: “Mortals make elaborate plans,
but God has the last word.” Solomon restates that idea in verse 9,
where he adds that even though we “plan [our] course . . . the Lord
establishes [our] steps.” In other words, we have ideas about what’s
supposed to happen, but sometimes God has another path for us.

How do I lose track of this spiritual truth? I make my plans,
sometimes forgetting to ask Him what His plans are. I get frustrated
when interruptions interfere.

But in place of that worrying, we could, as Solomon teaches, grow in
simply trusting that God guides us, step-by-step, as we prayerfully
seek Him, await His leading, and—yes—allow Him to continually redirect
us.
