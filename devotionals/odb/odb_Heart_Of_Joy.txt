Heart Of Joy

These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and
that your joy may be full. —
John 15:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 15:1-11

While waiting in the gate area of Singapore’s Changi Airport to board
my flight, I noticed a young family—mom, dad, and son. The area was
crowded, and they were looking for a place to sit. Suddenly, the
little boy began loudly singing “Joy to the World.” He was about 6
years old, so I was pretty impressed that he knew all the words.

What captured my attention even more was the look on the boy’s
face—his beaming smile matched the words he was singing as he
proclaimed to everyone at the gate the joy of the Christ who has come.

This joy is not limited to exuberant children nor should it be
confined to the Christmas season. The overflowing joy of knowing
Christ’s presence in our lives was one of the themes of Jesus’ final
teaching with His disciples the night before He died on the cross. He
told them of His extravagant love for them—that He loved them as the
Father loved Him (John 15:9). After sharing what this eternal
relationship looks like, Jesus said, “These things I have spoken to
you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full”
(v.11).

What a promise! Through Jesus Christ our hearts can be filled with
joy—real joy!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You have chosen me and redeemed me, crowned me with love and
compassion. I can do nothing less than overflow with joy at Your great
love for me, for those I love, and for the world.

In every season of life we can know joy in Christ.
