Whose Side Are You On?

It is good for me to draw near to God. —
Psalm 73:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 73

In the heat of the American Civil War, one of President Lincoln’s
advisors said he was grateful that God was on the side of the Union.
Lincoln replied, “Sir, my concern is not whether God is on our side;
my greatest concern is to be on God’s side, for God is always right.”

What a great challenge for us who assume that God is there to support
our plans, our perspectives, our decisions, and our desires. However,
Lincoln’s reply reminds us that even our best plans may not be near to
what God desires.

Clearly the psalmist wants to be on God’s side when he pleads, “Search
me, O God, and know my heart; . . . and see if there is any wicked way
in me, and lead me in the way everlasting” (Ps. 139:23-24). When we
follow the psalmist’s example to “draw near to God” (73:28), we can be
certain that we are on His side, as His Spirit helps us measure every
thought and action by His ways that are always right.

So, let’s ask ourselves: Are we on the Lord’s side? Being on His side
means that we will reflect His love to the world around us in the way
we interact with others. We will forgive, treat others justly, and
seek peace. God’s ways are always best.

Reflect & Pray

Father, teach us to search Your ways so that we may know how to be on
Your side of the critical issues in life. Thank You that when we draw
near to You, You draw near to us with gifts of wisdom and discernment.

When you draw near to God, you are sure to be on His side.
