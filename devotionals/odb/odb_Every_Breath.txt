Every Breath

I will put breath in you.
Ezekiel 37:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ezekiel 37:1–3, 7–10, 14

When Tee Unn came down with a rare autoimmune disease that weakened
all his muscles and nearly killed him, he realized that being able to
breathe was a gift. For more than a week, a machine had to pump air
into his lungs every few seconds, which was a painful part of his
treatment.

Tee Unn made a miraculous recovery, and today he reminds himself not
to complain about life’s challenges. “I’ll just take a deep breath,”
he says, “and thank God I can.”

How easy it is to focus on things we need or want, and forget that
sometimes the smallest things in life can be the greatest miracles. In
Ezekiel’s vision (Ezekiel 37:1–14), God showed the prophet that only
He could give life to dry bones. Even after tendons, flesh, and skin
had appeared, “there was no breath in them” (v. 8). It was only when
God gave them breath that they could live again (v. 10).

This vision illustrated God’s promise to restore Israel from
devastation. It also reminds me that anything I have, big or small, is
useless unless God gives me breath.

How about thanking God for the simplest blessings in life today? Amid
the daily struggle, let’s stop occasionally to take a deep breath, and
“let everything that has breath praise the Lord ” (Psalm 150:6).

Reflect & Pray

What will you thank God for right now? How can you remind yourself to
thank Him more often today?

Thank You, God, for every breath You’ve given me. Thank You for the
smallest things in life and the greatest miracles of life.
