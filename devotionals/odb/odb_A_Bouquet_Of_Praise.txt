A Bouquet Of Praise

. . . that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. —
1 Peter 4:11

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 4:7-11

Corrie ten Boom (1892–1983) was a World War II concentration camp
survivor and Christian who became a popular speaker around the world.
Thousands attended her meetings as she talked about how she had
learned to forgive her captors just as Christ had forgiven her sins.

After each meeting, people surrounded her and heaped accolades on her
for her godly qualities and thanked her for encouraging them in their
walk with the Lord. Corrie said she would then return to her hotel
room, get down on her knees, and present those compliments in thanks
to God. She called it giving God “a bouquet of praise.”

The Lord has given each of us gifts to use to minister to one another
(1 Peter 4:10) so that “in all things God may be glorified through
Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and
ever” (v.11). We have nothing to offer others that we have not first
received from the Lord (1 Cor. 4:7), so the glory does belong to Him.

To learn humility, perhaps we could follow Corrie’s example. If we
receive a compliment for something we’ve said or done, let’s privately
give a bouquet of praise to God for the glory He alone deserves.

Reflect & Pray

Immortal, invisible, God only wise, In light inaccessible hid from our
eyes, Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, Almighty,
victorious—Thy great name we praise. —Smith

Praise is the fairest blossom which springs from the soul.
