An Emergency Of The Spirit

David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his
son. —
2 Samuel 1:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Samuel 1:17-27

In March 2011, a devastating tsunami struck Japan, taking nearly
16,000 lives as it obliterated towns and villages along the coast.
Writer and poet Gretel Erlich visited Japan to witness and document
the destruction. When she felt inadequate to report what she was
seeing, she wrote a poem about it. In a PBS NewsHour interview she
said, “My old friend William Stafford, a poet now gone, said, ‘A poem
is an emergency of the spirit.’”

We find poetry used throughout the Bible to express deep emotion,
ranging from joyful praise to anguished loss. When King Saul and his
son Jonathan were killed in battle, David was overwhelmed with grief
(2 Sam. 1:1-12). He poured out his soul in a poem he called “the Song
of the Bow”: “Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their
lives, and in their death they were not divided. . . . How the mighty
have fallen in the midst of the battle! . . . I am distressed for you,
my brother Jonathan; you have been very pleasant to me” (vv.23-26).

When we face “an emergency of the spirit”—whether glad or sad—our
prayers can be a poem to the Lord. While we may stumble to articulate
what we feel, our heavenly Father hears our words as a true expression
of our hearts.

Reflect & Pray

Sometimes I do not pray in words— I take my heart in my two hands And
hold it up before the Lord— I am so glad He understands. —Nicholson

God does more than hear words; He reads hearts.
