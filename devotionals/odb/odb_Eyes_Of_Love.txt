Eyes Of Love

Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him. —
Mark 10:21

Today's Scripture: Mark 10:17-27

Many people who come to Marc Salem’s stage shows think he can read
minds. But he makes no such claim, saying he is not a psychic or
magician, but a close observer of people. He told writer Jennifer
Mulson, “We live in a world that’s mostly invisible to us because
we’re not paying attention to things . . . . I’m very sensitive to
what people give off” (The Gazette, Colorado Springs).

It’s interesting to note what Jesus saw as He met people. His
encounter with a wealthy young man seeking eternal life is recorded in
the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Mark includes this telling
detail, “Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him” (Mark 10:21). Some
people may have seen this young man as an arrogant person (vv.19-20)
while others might have envied his wealth, but Jesus looked at him
with love.

We often focus on the man’s sad departure and apparent unwillingness
to give up his riches and follow Jesus (v.22). When the disciples
wondered aloud about the difficulty of a rich man entering the kingdom
of God (v.26), “Jesus looked at them and said, ‘With men it is
impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible’”
(v.27).

Today, Jesus sees us through eyes of love and invites us to follow
Him.

Reflect & Pray

Down from His splendor in glory He came, Into a world of woe; Took on
Himself all my guilt and my shame, Why should He love me so? —Roth

God has both an all-seeing eye and all-forgiving heart.
