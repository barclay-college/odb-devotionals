Volcanic Activity

An angry man stirs up strife, and a furious man abounds in
transgression. —
Proverbs 29:22

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 4:29-32

It erupts. It melts everything in its path. Its blast is as powerful
as a nuclear explosion!

Well, maybe not—but a temper can feel as intense as a volcano when it
is aimed directly at another person in a family. The moment may be
quickly over, but it can leave emotional devastation and bitter
feelings behind.

It’s sad that the people we love the most are often the target of our
hurtful words. But even when we feel we’ve been provoked, we have a
choice. Will we respond in anger or in kindness?

The Bible tells us to rid ourselves of bitterness and anger, and to
“be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as
God in Christ forgave you” (Eph. 4:32).

If you are struggling with chronic anger that is hurting your
relationships, surrender this vulnerable part of your emotions to
Christ’s strength (Phil. 4:13). Ask God to forgive you for an
uncontrolled temper and to show you how to moderate your emotions and
to teach you how to honor others above yourself (Rom. 12:10). Seek out
help from others to learn how to deal with your strong emotions in
appropriate ways.

As we earnestly seek to love others and to please God, we can win the
victory over a volcanic temper.

Reflect & Pray

Spirit of God, please change my heart, And give me a new desire; I
want to be a man of peace, Not controlled by anger’s fire. —K. De Haan

Losing your temper is no way to get rid of it.
