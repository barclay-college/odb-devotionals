The True Owner

All things were created through Him and for Him. —
Colossians 1:16

Today's Scripture: Psalm 95:1-7

Did you hear about the church that didn’t have enough room for
parking? Fortunately, it was located right next to a store that was
closed on Sundays, so a church member asked the store owner if they
could overflow into his parking lot. “No problem,” he said. “You can
use it 51 weeks out of the year. On the 52nd week, though, it will be
chained off.” The man was grateful, but asked curiously, “What happens
that week?” The store owner smiled, “Nothing. I just want you to
remember that it’s not your parking lot.”

It’s easy to take for granted all the material and spiritual blessings
that God has given us. That’s why we need to stop and remember that
Scripture says the true owner of all we possess is God: “All that is
in heaven and in earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and You
are exalted as head over all” (1 Chron. 29:11). Even our bodies do not
belong to us: “Do you not know that your body is the temple of the
Holy Spirit . . . and you are not your own? For you were bought at a
price” (1 Cor. 6:19-20).

As 1 Timothy 6:17 reminds us: “God . . . gives us richly all things to
enjoy.” We are so abundantly blessed with good things! Let’s never
take our Father for granted, but use wisely and gratefully all that He
has given us.

Reflect & Pray

As we all enjoy God’s blessing, Oh, may we not forget Our Lord, from
whom all good gifts come— In Him our needs are met. —Fitzhugh

God gives blessing to us so we can give glory to Him.
