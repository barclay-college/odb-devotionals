The Factory of Sadness

[God] will wipe every tear from their eyes.
Revelation 21:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 16:28-33

As a lifelong Cleveland Browns football fan, I grew up knowing my
share of disappointment. Despite being one of only four teams to have
never appeared in a Super Bowl championship game, the Browns have a
loyal fan base that sticks with the team year in and year out. But
because the fans usually end up disappointed, many of them now refer
to the home stadium as the “Factory of Sadness.”

The broken world we live in can be a “factory of sadness” too. There
seems to be an endless supply of heartache and disappointment, whether
from our own choices or things beyond our control.

Yet the follower of Christ has hope—not only in the life to come but
for this very day. Jesus said, “I have told you these things, so that
in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But
take heart! I have overcome the world” (John 16:33). Notice that
without minimizing the struggles or sadness we may experience, Christ
counters them with His promises of peace, joy, and ultimate victory.

Great peace is available in Christ, and it’s more than enough to help
us navigate whatever life throws at us.

Reflect & Pray

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, when sorrows like sea
billows roll; whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, It is well,
it is well, with my soul. Horatio G. Spafford

Our hope and peace are found in Jesus.
