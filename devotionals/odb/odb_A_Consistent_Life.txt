A Consistent Life

He knelt down on his knees . . . and prayed and gave thanks before his
God, as was his custom since early days. —
Daniel 6:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Daniel 6:1-10

While studying the book of Daniel, I was struck by how easily he could
have avoided being thrown into the den of lions. Daniel’s jealous
rivals in the government of Babylon laid a trap based on his
consistent practice of daily prayer to God (Dan. 6:1-9). Daniel was
fully aware of their plot and could have decided to pray privately for
a month until things settled down. But that was not the kind of person
he was.

“When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home. And in
his upper room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt down
on his knees three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before
his God, as was his custom since early days” (v.10). Daniel did not
panic, nor bargain with God. Instead, he continued “just as he had
done before” (v.10 niv). He was not intimidated by the pressure of
persecution.

The lesson for me was the power of Daniel’s life of consistent
devotion to the Lord. His strength came from God, whom Daniel wanted
to please every day. When a crisis came, Daniel didn’t need to change
his daily practice to meet it. He simply stayed committed to his God.

Reflect & Pray

Father, I want to stand for You when persecution comes as Daniel did.
Give me that same bold commitment to pray and not to be ashamed of
knowing You. Help me to live my faith publicly.

God empowers us to stand for Him as we bow to pray.
