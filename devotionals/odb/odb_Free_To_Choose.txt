Free To Choose

He knelt down on his knees three times that day, and prayed and gave
thanks before his God, as was his custom since early days. —
Daniel 6:10

Today's Scripture: Daniel 6:1-10

When it was learned that the biggest football game of the 2011 season
was scheduled to be played on Yom Kippur, the student government at
the University of Texas petitioned school officials to change the
date. They said it was unfair to make Jewish students choose between
the classic football rivalry with Oklahoma and observing their most
important and sacred holy day of the year. But the date was not
changed. Even in societies where people have religious freedom,
difficult choices are still required of every person of faith.

Daniel demonstrated the courage to obey God no matter what the
consequences. When his political rivals set a trap to eliminate him
from their path to power (Dan. 6:1-9), he didn’t challenge the law or
complain that he had been wronged. “When Daniel knew that the writing
was signed, he went home. And in his upper room, with his windows open
toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his knees three times that day, and
prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his custom since early
days” (v.10).

Daniel didn’t know if God would save him from the lions’ den, but it
didn’t matter. He chose to honor God in his life whatever the outcome.
Like Daniel, we are free to choose to follow the Lord.

Reflect & Pray

What freedom lies with all who choose To live for God each day! But
chains of bondage shackle those Who choose some other way. —D. De Haan

You can never go wrong when you choose to follow Christ.
