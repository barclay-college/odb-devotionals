I, Me, Mine

Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit. —
Philippians 2:3

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:1-11

In 1970, the Beatles began work on a documentary intended to show how
their music was made. But instead of revealing the process of musical
creativity, the film pulled the curtain back on a display of self-
interest and bickering. The band members were more concerned about
their own songs than the advancement of the group. Shortly after the
project was completed, the group dissolved in disharmony and broken
friendships.

It’s an age-old problem. In the first century AD, the apostle Paul
feared that the believers in the church at Philippi would fall into
the trap of selfishness. He knew that when the desire for personal
advancement overrides concern for one another, attitudes quickly
become disruptive and divisive.

To counteract this dangerous tendency, Paul wrote, “Let nothing be
done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let
each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not
only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others”
(Phil. 2:3-4).

What would a documentary of your life reveal? Selfishness or
selflessness? We must look out for one another, for selfless concern
will prevent division and build unity in our church families.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, let me live from day to day In such a self-forgetful way That
even when I kneel to pray My prayer will be for others. —Meigs

A heart that is focused on others will not be consumed with self.
