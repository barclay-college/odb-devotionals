The Storms of Life

You may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have
come so that the proven genuineness of your faith . . . may result in
praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
1 Peter 1:6-7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 4:35–5:1

In the book of Mark we read about a terrible storm. The disciples were
with Jesus on a boat crossing the Sea of Galilee. When a “furious
squall came up,” the disciples—among them some seasoned fishermen—were
afraid for their lives (4:37-38). Did God not care? Weren’t they
handpicked by Jesus and closest to Him? Weren’t they obeying Jesus who
told them to “go over to the other side”? (v. 35). Why, then, were
they going through such a turbulent time?

No one is exempt from the storms of life. But just as the disciples
who initially feared the storm later came to revere Christ more, so
the storms we face can bring us to a deeper knowledge of God. “Who is
this,” the disciples pondered, “even the wind and the waves obey him!”
(v. 41). Through our trials we can learn that no storm is big enough
to prevent God from accomplishing His will (5:1).

While we may not understand why God allows trials to enter our lives,
we thank Him that through them we can come to know who He is. We live
to serve Him because He has preserved our lives.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I know I don’t need to fear the storms of life around me. Help
me to be calm because I stand secure in You.

The storms of life prove the strength of our anchor.
