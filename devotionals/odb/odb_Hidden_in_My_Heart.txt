Hidden in My Heart

I have hidden your word in my heart.
Psalm 119:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:9-16

I’m getting used to reading digital magazines, and I feel good that
I’m saving trees. Plus, I don’t have to wait for the magazines to come
in the mail. I do, however, miss the print editions because I like to
run my fingers through the glossy pages and cut out my favorite
recipes.

I also have a digital edition of the Bible on my reading device. But I
still have my favorite printed Bible—the one I have underlined and
read many times. We don’t know the future of the printed page, but one
thing we do know: The best place for God’s Word is not on our cell
phones, electronic reading devices, or bedside table.

In Psalm 119 we read about treasuring the Scriptures in our hearts: “I
have hidden your word in my heart” (v. 11). Nothing compares to
pondering God’s Word, learning more of Him, and putting it into
practice in our daily lives. The best place for His Word lies deep in
our souls.

We may have many excuses for not reading, meditating, or memorizing,
but we need God’s Word. I pray that God will help us store His Word in
the best place possible—our hearts.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give me the desire to read Your Word. Then implant it in my
heart and thoughts and help me live it out.

The best place for God’s Word is our hearts.
