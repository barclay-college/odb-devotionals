The Survival Float

Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you.
Psalm 55:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 55:4–23

Sunlight glittered on the swimming pool in front of me. I overheard an
instructor speaking to a student who had been in the water for quite a
while. He said, “It looks like you’re getting tired. When you’re
exhausted and in deep water, try the survival float.”

Certain situations in life require us to spend our mental, physical,
or emotional energy in a way that we can’t sustain. David described a
time when his enemies were threatening him and he felt the emotional
weight of their anger. He needed to escape the distress he was
experiencing.

As he processed his feelings, he found a way to rest in his troubled
thoughts. He said, “Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain
you” (Ps. 55:22). He recognized that God supports us if we dare to
release our problems to Him. We don’t have to take charge of every
situation and try to craft the outcome—that’s exhausting! God is in
control of every aspect of our life.

Instead of trying to do everything in our own effort, we can find rest
in God. Sometimes it’s as simple as asking Him to handle our problems.
Then we can pause, relax, and enjoy the knowledge that He is
sustaining us.
