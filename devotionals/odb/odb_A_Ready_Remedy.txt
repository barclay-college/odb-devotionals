A Ready Remedy

The punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we
are healed.
Isaiah 53:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 53:1–6

Following the park guide, I scribbled notes as he taught about the
plants of the Bahamian primeval forest. He told us which trees to
avoid. The poisonwood tree, he said, secretes a black sap that causes
a painful, itchy rash. But not to worry! The antidote could usually be
found growing right next it. “Cut into the red bark of the gum elemi
tree,” he said, “and rub the sap on the rash. It will immediately
begin to heal.”

I nearly dropped my pencil in astonishment. I hadn’t expected to find
a picture of salvation in the forest. But in the gum elemi tree, I saw
Jesus. He’s the ready remedy wherever the poison of sin is found. Like
the red bark of that tree, the blood of Jesus brings healing.

The prophet Isaiah understood that humanity needed healing. The rash
of sin had infected us. Isaiah promised that our healing would come
through “a man of suffering” who would take our sickness upon Himself
(Isaiah 53:3). That man was Jesus. We were sick, but Christ was
willing to be wounded in our place. When we believe in Him, we are
healed from the sickness of sin (v. 5). It may take a lifetime to
learn to live as those who’re healed—to recognize our sins and to
reject them in favor of our new identity—but because of Jesus, we can.

Reflect & Pray

What other pictures in the natural world do you see of the salvation
God offers us? What has the healing He offers meant to you?

Wherever sin is, Jesus is there, ready to save.
