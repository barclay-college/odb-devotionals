The Best Gift

Seek and you will find.
Luke 11:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 11:9–13

When I was packing up to go home to London, my mother approached me
with a gift—one of her rings I had long admired. Surprised, I asked,
“What’s this for?” She replied, “I think you should enjoy it now. Why
wait until I die? It doesn’t fit me anyway.” With a smile I received
her unexpected gift, an early inheritance that brings me joy.

My mom gave me a material gift, but Jesus promises that His Father
will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask (Luke 11:13). If parents
who are marred with sin can provide necessities (such as fish or eggs)
for their children, how much more will our Father in heaven give to
His children. Through the gift of the Holy Spirit (John 16:13), we can
experience hope, love, joy, and peace even in times of trouble—and we
can share these gifts with others.

Growing up, we may have had parents who were unable to love and care
for us fully. Or we may have had mothers and fathers who were shining
examples of sacrificial love. Or our experience may
have been somewhere in between. Whatever we’ve known with our earthly
parents, we can hold onto the promise that our heavenly Father loves
us unceasingly. He gave His children the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, I’m amazed at Your love for me. Help me to dwell in
Your presence this day, sharing Your love with those I meet.

Our Father gives good gifts.
