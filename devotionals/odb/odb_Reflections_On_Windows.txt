Reflections On Windows

Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things from Your law. —
Psalm 119:18

Today's Scripture: Psalm 34:1-10

Much of the scenery I saw during our vacation in Alaska was through
the windows of moving vehicles. I was thankful for glass that allowed
me to see the beauty while remaining warm and dry. But the windows
also presented a challenge. When it rained, water drops on the outside
obscured the view. When the temperature changed, condensation caused
fog to develop on the inside.

Those challenges help me understand why it is impossible for us to see
life the way God intended it. Sin obscures the beauty of life that God
wants us to enjoy. Sometimes sin is inside—our selfishness creates a
fog that makes us see ourselves as more important than we are and
causes us to forget about others’ interests. Sometimes sin is outside.
The injustice of others causes our tears to fall like rain, preventing
us from seeing the goodness of God. Sin of any kind keeps us from
seeing the wonder and glory of life as God designed it.

For now, even though “we see things imperfectly, like puzzling
reflections in a mirror” (1 Cor. 13:12 nlt), we see enough to know
that God is good (Ps. 34:8). The many wonderful things that God has
revealed will help us to forsake sin and work to minimize its
consequences in the world.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, improve our vision. Clear the fog that comes from self-centered
thinking. Help us to uphold justice, to offer comfort to others, and
to wipe away the tears that have been left by the storms of life.

The only way to see life clearly is to focus on Christ.
