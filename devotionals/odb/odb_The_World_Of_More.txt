The World Of More

Eye has not seen . . . the things which God has prepared for those who
love Him. —
1 Corinthians 2:9

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:1-11

My cable company sent a postcard inviting me to check out its latest
improvements in TV channels. The card indicated that I needed to
contact the company to get the necessary new digital equipment and
explained how to hook it up and activate it. After that, the ad said I
was just to “sit back and enjoy the World of More.”

The card made me think of the “World of More” that Christians are
privileged to live in. When God transports people from the darkness of
sin “into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9), a whole new life opens
up.

Romans 5 tells us some of the more that we have in Christ: We have
been “reconciled to God through the death of His Son” (v.10) and
therefore have “peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (v.1).
We have access to God and His grace (v.2). Rejoicing in trouble is now
possible because we understand that it’s an opportunity to grow in our
character through trusting Him (vv.3-4). Additionally, the Holy
Spirit, who has been given to live in us, pours the love of God into
our hearts (v.5). And sin no longer has the same hold on us (6:18).

As Christians, we have unlimited access to a real “World of More.”
Wouldn’t it be selfish not to invite others to join us in that special
world?
