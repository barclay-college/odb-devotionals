Terrifying Moments

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they
comfort me. —
Psalm 23:4

Today's Scripture: Psalm 23

When our first child was born, my wife, Marlene, was in labor for more
than 30 hours, creating tremendous stress for both her and the baby.
The doctor, a fill-in for her regular physician, was unfamiliar with
her and her pregnancy. As a result, he waited too long to make the
decision to perform an emergency Caesarean section, and the resulting
trauma put our infant son in the neo-natal intensive care unit. There
was nothing they could do to help our baby to overcome his trauma-
induced condition.

By God’s grace, Matt recovered—but I cannot remember any moment in my
life as terrifying as when I stood by his crib in intensive care. Yet
I knew the Lord was near as I talked with Him through prayer.

In the terrifying moments of life (and all the other moments as well)
nothing can bring comfort to the hurting heart like the reality of
God’s presence and care. The psalmist David wrote, “Yea, though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for
You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me” (Ps. 23:4).

When fear is overwhelming, the Lord is there. His comforting presence
will carry us through our deepest trials.

Reflect & Pray

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea
billows roll— Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say, “It is well,
it is well with my soul.” —Spafford

Peace is the presence of God.
