Christ the Redeemer

I know that my Redeemer lives. —
Job 19:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 19:23-29

The famous statue Christ the Redeemer overlooks the city of Rio de
Janeiro. The statue is a model of Christ with His arms extended so
that His body forms the shape of a cross. Brazilian architect Heitor
da Silva Costa designed the figure. He imagined that the city’s
residents would see it as the first image to emerge from the darkness
at dawn. At dusk, he hoped the city dwellers would view the setting
sun as a halo behind the statue’s head.

There is value in keeping our eyes on our Redeemer each day, during
the good times and the difficult times. As he suffered, Job said, “I
know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth”
(Job 19:25).

The cry of Job’s heart points us to Jesus—our living Savior who will
visit the earth again one day (1 Thess. 4:16-18). Keeping our eyes on
Jesus means remembering that we have been rescued from our sin. Jesus
“gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed
and purify for Himself His own special people” (Titus 2:14).

Anyone who has accepted Jesus as Savior has a reason to be glad today.
No matter what we endure on earth, we can have hope today and look
forward to enjoying eternity with Him.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Jesus, You are my rescuer. Because You died and rose again, I am
free from the consequences of my sin forever. Thank You for redeeming
my life.

Through His cross and resurrection, Jesus rescues and redeems.
