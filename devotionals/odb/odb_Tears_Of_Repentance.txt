Tears Of Repentance

Peter went out and wept bitterly. —
Luke 22:62

Today's Scripture: Luke 22:54-62

My husband, a self-proclaimed computer illiterate, purchased a
computer to help him with his business. After giving him a few
pointers, I left him alone to do some experimenting. It wasn’t long,
however, before I heard a slightly panicked voice from the office:
“Hey, where’s that ‘uh-oh’ button?”

What he had been looking for, of course, was the “undo” key that lets
you backtrack when you’ve made a mistake. Have you ever wished for one
of those in life? A provision to reverse, repair, or restore what’s
been broken or damaged by sin?

After Jesus’ arrest, Peter, one of His beloved disciples, denied three
times that he knew Him. Then, we read, “the Lord turned” and simply
“looked at” him. Peter “went out and wept bitterly” (Luke 22:61-62).
His tears were most likely tears of shame and repentance. No doubt he
wished he could undo his actions. But Peter wasn’t left in his misery.
After Jesus’ resurrection, He restored Peter, giving him opportunity
to reaffirm his love (John 21:15-17).

When you sorrow over sin in your life, remember that God has provided
a method of restoration. “If we confess our sins,” He will “forgive
us” and “cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).

Reflect & Pray

We’re thankful, Lord, that when we fall We can begin anew If humbly we
confess our sin, Then turn and follow You. —Sper

The way back to God begins with a broken heart.
