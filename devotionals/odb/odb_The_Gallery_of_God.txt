The Gallery of God

The Lord is good and his love endures forever.
Psalm 100:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 100

Psalm 100 is like a work of art that helps us celebrate our unseen
God. While the focus of our worship is beyond view, His people make
Him known.

Imagine the artist with brush and palette working the colorful words
of this psalm onto a canvas. What emerges before our eyes is a
world—“all the earth”—shouting for joy to the Lord (v. 1). Joy.
Because it is the delight of our God to redeem us from death. “For the
joy that was set before Him,” Jesus endured the cross (Heb. 12:2
nkjv).

As our eyes move across the canvas we see an all-world choir of
countless members singing “with gladness” and “joyful songs” (Ps.
100:2). Our heavenly Father’s heart is pleased when His people worship
Him for who He is and what He has done.

Then we see images of ourselves, fashioned from dust in the hands of
our Creator, and led like sheep into green pastures (v. 3). We, His
people, have a loving Shepherd.

Finally, we see God’s great and glorious dwelling place—and the gates
through which His rescued people enter His unseen presence, while
giving Him thanks and praise (v. 4).

What a picture, inspired by our God. Our good, loving, and faithful
God. No wonder it will take forever to enjoy His greatness!
