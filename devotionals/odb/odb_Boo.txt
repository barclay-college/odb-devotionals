Boo!

[God] will be very gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He
hears it, He will answer you. —
Isaiah 30:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 30:1-5,18-19

One of the early games that many parents play with their children
involves a fake scare. Dad hides his face behind his hands and
suddenly reveals himself while saying, “Boo!” The child giggles at
this silliness.

Being frightened is a fun game until the day when the child
experiences a real scare. Then it’s no laughing matter. The first real
scare often involves separation from a parent. The child wanders away
innocently, moving from one attraction to another. But as soon as she
realizes she is lost, she panics and lets out a loud cry of alarm. The
parent immediately comes running to reassure the child that she is not
alone.

As we get older, our fake scares become sophisticated—scary books,
movies, amusement park rides. Being scared is so invigorating that we
may begin taking bigger risks for bigger thrills.

But when a real scare comes, we may realize that we, like the ancient
Israelites (Isa. 30), have wandered from the One who loves and cares
for us. Recognizing that we are in danger, we panic. Our call for help
does not require sophisticated words or a well-reasoned defense, just
a desperate cry.

Like a loving parent, God responds quickly for He longs to have us
live in the protection of His love where we need never be afraid.
