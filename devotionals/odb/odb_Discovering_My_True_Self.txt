Discovering My True Self

We know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall
see him as he is.
1 John 3:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 2:28–3:3

Who am I? That’s the question a faded stuffed animal asks himself in
the children’s book Nothing by Mick Inkpen. Left in a dusty corner of
an attic, the animal hears movers call him “nothing” and thinks that’s
his name: Nothing.

Encounters with other animals spark memories. Nothing realizes that he
used to have a tail, whiskers, and stripes. But it’s not until he
meets a tabby cat who helps him find his way home that Nothing
remembers who he truly is: a stuffed cat named Toby. His owner
lovingly restores him, sewing on new ears, tail, whiskers, and
stripes.

Whenever I read this book, I think about my own identity. Who am I?
John, writing to believers, said that God has called us His children
(1 John 3:1). We don’t fully understand that identity, but when we see
Jesus, we will be like him (v. 2). Just like Toby the cat, we will one
day be restored to the identity intended for us, which has been marred
by sin. For now, we can understand that identity in part, and we can
recognize the image of God in each other. But one day, when we see
Jesus, we will be fully restored to the identity God intended for us.
We will be made new.

Reflect & Pray

Where do I find my identity? According to Scripture, how does God view
me?

God, thank You for rescuing us and restoring us.
