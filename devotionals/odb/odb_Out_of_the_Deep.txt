Out of the Deep

He reached down from on high and took hold of me.
2 Samuel 22:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Samuel 22:17–20

I scanned the water intently, on alert for signs of trouble. During my
six-hour shifts as a lifeguard, I watched from the side of the pool to
ensure the safety of those swimming. Leaving my post, or even becoming
lax in my attentiveness, could have grave consequences for those in
the pool. If a swimmer was in danger of drowning due to injury or lack
of skill, it was my responsibility to pluck them from the water and
return them to safety on the pool deck.

After experiencing God’s aid in battle against the Philistines (2 Sam.
21:15–22), David likens his rescue to being drawn out of “deep waters”
(22:17). David’s very life—and that of his men—was in serious danger
from his enemies. God buoyed David as he was drowning in disaster.
While lifeguards are paid to assure the safety of swimmers, God, on
the other hand, saved David because of His delight in him (v. 20). My
heart leaps for joy when I realize that God doesn’t watch over and
protect me because He’s obliged to but because He wants to.

When we feel overcome by the troubles of life, we can rest in the
knowledge that God, our Lifeguard, sees our struggle and, because of
His delight in us, watches over and protects us.
