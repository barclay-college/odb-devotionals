A Blessing Bowl

I thank my God every time I remember you.
Philippians 1:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 1:1–10

The familiar bing of an arriving email caught my attention while I
wrote at my computer. Usually I try to resist the temptation to check
every email but the subject line was too enticing: “You are a
blessing.”

Eagerly, I opened it to discover a faraway friend telling me she was
praying for my family. Each week, she displays one Christmas card
photo in her kitchen table “Blessing Bowl” and prays for that family.
She wrote, “I thank my God every time I remember you” (Philippians
1:3) and then highlighted our efforts to share God’s love with
others—our “partnership” in the gospel.

Through my friend’s intentional gesture, the apostle Paul’s words to
the Philippians came trickling into my inbox, creating the same joy in
my heart I suspect readers received from his first-century thank-you
note. It seems Paul made it a habit to speak his gratitude to those
who worked alongside him. A similar phrase opens many of his letters:
“I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your
faith is being reported all over the world” (Romans 1:8).

In the first century, Paul blessed his co-laborers with a thank-you
note of prayerfulness. In the twenty-first century, my friend used a
Blessing Bowl to bring joy into my day. How might we thank those who
serve in the mission of God with us today?

Reflect & Pray

Father, help us to intentionally bless those who serve alongside us.

Who can you thank today?
