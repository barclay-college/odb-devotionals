Walking on Water

Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid. —
Matthew 14:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 14:22-33

When I learned to sail, I had to walk along a very unsteady floating
platform to reach the little boats in which we had our lessons. I
hated it. I don’t have a good sense of balance and was terrified of
falling between the platform and the boat as I attempted to get in. I
nearly gave up. “Fix your eyes on me,” said the instructor. “I’m here,
and I’ll catch you if you slip.” I did what he said, and I am now the
proud possessor of a basic sailing proficiency certificate!

Do you avoid taking risks at all costs? Many of us are reluctant to
step out of our comfort zones in case we fail, get hurt, or look
stupid. But if we allow that fear to bind us, we’ll end up afraid to
do anything.

The story of Peter’s water-walking adventure and why it supposedly
failed is a popular choice for preachers (Matt. 14:22-33). But I don’t
think I’ve ever heard any of them discuss the behavior of the rest of
the disciples. In my opinion, Peter was a success. He felt the fear
but responded to the call of Jesus anyway. Maybe it was those who
never tried at all who failed.

Jesus risked everything for us. What are we prepared to risk for Him?

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for stretching out Your hand and saying, “Come.”
Help me to get out of the boat, knowing that it is totally safe to
walk on water with You.
