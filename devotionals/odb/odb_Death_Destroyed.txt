Death Destroyed!

O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory? —
1 Corinthians 15:55

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 15:50-58

Medical researchers are working tirelessly to find a cure for cancer,
a clue to the mystery of Alzheimer’s, and ways to conquer a host of
other debilitating diseases. But what if you awoke to headlines saying
DEATH DESTROYED! Would you believe it? Could you believe it?

The New Testament proclaims that for the believer in Christ, death has
been destroyed—reduced to inactivity—rendered incapable of doing what
it once did. “So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and
this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the
saying that is written: ‘Death is swallowed up in victory’” (1 Cor.
15:54).

This good news is for everyone who will receive it—just as the angel
told the shepherds when Jesus was born, “Do not be afraid, for behold,
I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For
there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is
Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:10-11).

The birth of Jesus was the beginning of the end for death. “The sting
of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to
God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Cor.
15:56-57).

That is why we celebrate Christmas!

Reflect & Pray

Mild He lays His glory by, Born that man no more may die. Born to
raise the sons of earth, Born to give them second birth. —Wesley

The birth of Christ brought God to man; the cross of Christ brings man
to God.
