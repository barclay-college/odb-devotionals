Wisdom Seekers

Blessed are those who find wisdom. —
Proverbs 3:13

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 3:1-18

Every spring colleges and universities hold commencement ceremonies to
celebrate the success of students who have completed their studies and
earned their degrees. After the students cross the stage, these
graduates will enter a world that will challenge them. Just having
academic knowledge won’t be good enough. The key to success in life
will be in wisely applying everything they have learned.

Throughout Scripture, wisdom is celebrated as a treasure that is worth
seeking. It is better than riches (Prov. 3:13-18). Its source is God,
who alone is perfectly wise (Rom. 16:27). And it is found in the
actions and attitude of Jesus, in whom “all the treasures of wisdom”
are found (Col. 2:3). Wisdom comes from reading and applying the
Scripture. We have an example of this in the way Jesus applied His
knowledge when He was tempted (Luke 4:1-13). In other words, the truly
wise person tries to see life from God’s point of view and chooses to
live according to His wisdom.

What’s the payoff for this kind of life? Proverbs tells us that wisdom
is like sweetness of honey on the tongue (Prov. 24:13-14). “Blessed
are those who find wisdom” (3:13 niv). So seek wisdom, for it is more
profitable than silver or gold!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, strengthen my resolve to live by the wisdom that comes only from
You. Give me the discernment to live all of life from Your point of
view that I might know the blessings of a life lived wisely.

Blessing comes from seeking wisdom and living by it.
