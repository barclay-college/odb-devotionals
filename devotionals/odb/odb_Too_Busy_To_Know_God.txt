Too Busy To Know God?

She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard
His word. —
Luke 10:39

Today's Scripture: Luke 10:38-42

One day when I was waiting to board a plane, a stranger who had
overheard me mention that I was a chaplain began to describe to me his
life before he met Christ. He said it was marked by “sin and self-
absorption. Then I met Jesus.”

I listened with interest to a list of changes he had made to his life
and good deeds he had done. But because everything he told me was
about his busyness for God and not his fellowship with God, I wasn’t
surprised when he added, “Frankly, chaplain, I thought I’d feel better
about myself by now.”

I think the New Testament character Martha would have understood that
stranger’s observation. Having invited Jesus to be a guest at her
home, she set about doing what she thought were the important things.
But this meant she couldn’t focus on Jesus. Because Mary wasn’t
helping, Martha felt justified asking Jesus to chide her. It’s a
mistake many of us make: We’re so busy doing good that we don’t spend
time getting to know God better.

My advice to my new airplane friend came from the core of Jesus’ words
to Martha in Luke 10:41-42. I said to him: “Slow down and invest
yourself in knowing God; let His Word reveal Himself to you.” If we’re
too busy to spend time with God, we’re simply too busy.

Reflect & Pray

Savior, let me walk beside Thee, Let me feel my hand in Thine; Let me
know the joy of walking In Thy strength and not in mine. —Sidebotham

Our heavenly Father longs to spend time with His children.
