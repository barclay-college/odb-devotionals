Walking with the Lord

The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in
his way. —
Psalm 37:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 37:23-31

A small pamphlet I received from a friend was titled “An Attempt to
Share the Story of 86 Years of Relationship with the Lord.” In it, Al
Ackenheil noted key people and events in his journey of faith over
nearly nine decades. What seemed to be ordinary choices at the
time—memorizing Bible verses, meeting for prayer with others, telling
his neighbors about Jesus—became turning points that changed the
direction of his life. It was fascinating to read how God’s hand
guided and encouraged Al.

The psalmist wrote, “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord,
and He delights in his way” (Ps. 37:23). The passage continues with a
beautiful description of God’s faithful care for everyone who wants to
walk with Him. “The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps
shall slide” (v. 31).

Each of us could create a record of God’s leading and faithfulness,
reflecting on God’s guidance—the people, places, and experiences that
are landmarks on our pathway of faith. Every remembrance of the Lord’s
goodness encourages us to keep walking with Him and to thank someone
who influenced us for good.

The Lord guides and guards all who walk with Him.
