God Provides, But How?

He who tills his land will be satisfied with bread. —
Proverbs 12:11

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 24:19-22

Outside my office window, the squirrels are in a race against winter
to bury their acorns in a safe, accessible place. Their commotion
amuses me. An entire herd of deer can go through our back yard and not
make a sound, but one squirrel sounds like an invasion.

The two creatures are different in another way as well. Deer do not
prepare for winter. When the snow comes they eat whatever they can
find along the way (including ornamental shrubs in our yard). But
squirrels would starve if they followed that example. They would be
unable to find suitable food.

The deer and the squirrel represent ways that God cares for us. He
enables us to work and save for the future, and He meets our need when
resources are scarce. As the wisdom literature teaches, God gives us
seasons of plenty so that we can prepare for seasons of need (Prov.
12:11). And as Psalm 23 says, the Lord leads us through perilous
places to pleasant pastures.

Another way that God provides is by instructing those with plenty to
share with those in need (Deut. 24:19). So when it comes to provision,
the message of the Bible is this: Work while we can, save what we can,
share what we can, and trust God to meet our needs.
