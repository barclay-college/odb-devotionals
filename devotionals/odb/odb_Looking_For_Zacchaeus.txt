Looking For Zacchaeus

Today salvation has come to this house. —
Luke 19:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 19:1-10

Alf Clark walks the city streets looking for Zacchaeus. Well, not the
actual one in the Bible—Jesus already found him. Alf and some friends
who serve with an urban ministry do what Jesus did in Luke 19. They go
purposefully through town to meet with and help those in need.

Alf walks house to house in his neighborhood, knocking on doors and
saying to whoever peeks out, “Hi, I’m Alf. Do you have any needs I can
pray for?” It’s his way of opening up communication and—like Jesus did
with tax-collector Zacchaeus—seeking to supply needed counsel and
spiritual life and hope.

Notice what Jesus did. Luke simply says that Jesus “passed through”
Jericho (Luke 19:1). Of course, a crowd gathered, as usually occurred
when Jesus came to town. Zacchaeus, being “height challenged,” climbed
a tree. Jesus, while passing through, walked right over to his tree
and told him He had to visit at his house. That day salvation came to
Zacchaeus’s house. Jesus had “come to seek and to save that which was
lost” (v.10).

Do we look for Zacchaeus? He is everywhere, needing Jesus. In what
ways can we share Christ’s love with people who need the Savior?

Reflect & Pray

God, guide our steps toward and not away from those who need You. Then
guide our words and our actions so that we can be purposeful in our
encounters with others.

God’s good news is too good to keep to ourselves.
