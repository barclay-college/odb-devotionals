Intimate Details

You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from
afar.
Psalm 139:2

Today's Scripture: Psalm 139:1–18

The universe is astonishingly grand. Right now the moon is spinning
around us at nearly 2,300 miles an hour. Our Earth is spinning around
the sun at 66,000 miles an hour. Our sun is one of 200 billion other
stars and trillions more planets in our galaxy, and that galaxy is
just one of 100 billion others hurtling through space. Astounding!

In comparison to this vast cosmos, our little Earth is no bigger than
a pebble, and our individual lives no greater than a grain of sand.
Yet according to Scripture, the God of the galaxies attends to each
microscopic one of us in intimate detail. He saw us before we existed
(Ps. 139:13–16); He watches us as we go about our days and listens for
our every thought (vv. 1–6).

It can be hard to believe this sometimes. This tiny “pebble” has big
problems like war and famine, and we can question God’s care in times
of personal suffering. But when King David wrote Psalm 139 he was in
the midst of crisis himself (vv. 19–20). And when Jesus said God
counts each hair on our heads (Matt. 10:30), He was living in an age
of crucifixion. Biblical talk of God’s caring attention isn’t a naïve
wish. It is real-world truth.

The One who keeps the galaxies spinning knows us intimately. That can
help us get through the worst of times.

Reflect & Pray

Father God, Your eye is on me as much as it is on the stars in the
sky. Thank You for Your love, Your care, Your attention.

The God of the cosmos cares for us intimately.
