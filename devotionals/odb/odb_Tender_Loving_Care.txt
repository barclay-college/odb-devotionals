Tender Loving Care

We were gentle among you, just as a nursing mother cherishes her own
children. —
1 Thessalonians 2:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 2:1-7

Max runs a small farm as a hobby. Recently when he checked on the cows
he is raising, he was surprised to see a newborn calf! When he bought
the cattle, he had no idea one was pregnant. Sadly, the mother cow had
complications and died shortly after her calf was born. Immediately,
Max purchased some powdered milk so he could feed the calf from a
bottle. “The calf thinks I’m its mother!” Max said.

The tender story of Max’s new role with the calf reminded me of how
Paul likened himself to a caring mother in dealing with the believers
at Thessalonica: “We were gentle among you,” he said, “just as a
nursing mother cherishes her own children” (1 Thess. 2:7).

Paul adopted a nurturing attitude when teaching people. He knew
believers needed the “milk of the word” for spiritual growth (1 Peter
2:2). But he also gave special attention to the concerns of those he
cared for. “We dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own
children,” Paul said, “encouraging, comforting and urging you to live
lives worthy of God” (1 Thess. 2:11-12 niv).

As we serve each other, may we serve with the tender loving care of
our Savior, encouraging each other in our spiritual journey (Heb.
10:24).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me to be sensitive and caring as I serve others. Help
me to love others tenderly as You so tenderly love and care for me.

God pours His love into our hearts to flow out to others’ lives.
