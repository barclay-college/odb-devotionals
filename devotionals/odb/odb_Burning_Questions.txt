Burning Questions

“I am who I am”
Exodus 3:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 3:1-6,10-14

An old Native American story tells of a young boy who was sent into
the woods alone on an autumn night to prove his courage. Soon the sky
darkened and the sounds of night filled the air. Trees creaked and
groaned, an owl screeched, and a coyote howled. Even though he was
frightened, the boy remained in the woods all night, as the test of
courage required. Finally morning came, and he saw a solitary figure
nearby. It was his grandfather, who had been watching over him all
night long.

When Moses went deep into the desert, he saw a burning bush that
didn’t burn up. Then God began talking to him from the bush,
commissioning him to go back to Egypt and lead the Israelites out of
cruel slavery to freedom. A reluctant Moses began to ask questions:
“Who am I that I should go?”

God simply answered, “I will be with you.”

“Suppose I . . . say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to
you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell
them?”

God replied, “I am who I am. . . . [Say to them,] I am has sent me to
you’ ” (Ex. 3:11-14). The phrase “I am who I am” can be interpreted,
“I will be who I will be” and reveals God’s eternal and all-sufficient
character.

God has promised always to be present with those who believe in Jesus.
No matter how dark the night, the unseen God is ready to respond
appropriately to our need.
