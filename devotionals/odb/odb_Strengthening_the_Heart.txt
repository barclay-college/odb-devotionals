Strengthening the Heart

It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace.
Hebrews 13:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Timothy 4:6–11

The neighborhood fitness center where I have worked out for years
closed down last month, and I had to join a new gym. The former place
was a warm, friendly facility, patronized by those who liked to
socialize while they worked out. We hardly ever broke a sweat. The new
gym is a hard-core facility filled with serious men and women,
earnestly invested in building better bodies. I watch these people
strain and toil. Their bodies look strong, but I wonder if their
hearts are being strengthened with grace.

The heart is a muscle—the muscle that keeps the other muscles going.
It’s good to build and tone our other muscles, but the essential thing
is doing whatever keeps the heart strong.

So it is with our spiritual heart. We strengthen and tone the heart
through the Word of truth by receiving its message of God’s goodness
and grace. Keeping our spiritual heart strong and fit must be our
first priority, the one thing we do above all others.

Paul would agree: “Train yourself for godliness; for while bodily
training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it
holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come”
(1 Tim. 4:7–8 esv).

Reflect & Pray

May I feed on Your goodness every day, Lord, so my heart will grow
stronger through the Spirit.

God’s training is designed to grow us in faith.
