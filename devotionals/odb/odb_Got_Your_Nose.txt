Got Your Nose

I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt.
Exodus 12:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 12:12–19

“Why are the statues’ noses broken?” That’s the number one question
visitors ask Edward Bleiberg, curator of Egyptian art at the Brooklyn
Museum.

Bleiberg can’t blame it on normal wear and tear; even two-dimensional
painted figures are missing noses. He surmises that such destruction
must have been intentional. Enemies meant to kill Egypt’s gods. It’s
as if they were playing a game of “got your nose” with them. Invading
armies broke off the noses of these idols so they couldn’t breathe.

Really? That’s all it took? With gods like these, Pharaoh should have
known he was in trouble. Yes, he had an army and the allegiance of a
whole nation. The Hebrews were weary slaves led by a timid fugitive
named Moses. But Israel had the living God, and Pharaoh’s gods were
pretenders. Ten plagues later, their imaginary lives were snuffed out.

Israel celebrated their victory with the Festival of Unleavened Bread,
when they ate bread without yeast for a week (Exodus 12:17; 13:7–9).
Yeast symbolizes sin, and God wanted His people to remember their
rescued lives belong entirely to Him.

Our Father says to idols, “Got your nose,” and to His children, “Got
your life.” Serve the God who gives you breath, and rest in His loving
arms.

Reflect & Pray

What false god is suffocating your life? How might you show God you’re
trusting only in Him?

Father of life, I give You my life. Help me recognize that any
perceived “enemies” in my life are nothing compared to Your power.
