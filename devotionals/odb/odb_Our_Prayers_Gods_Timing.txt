Our Prayers, God’s Timing

Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or
imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.
Ephesians 3:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 1:5–17

Sometimes God takes His time in answering our prayers, and that isn’t
always easy for us to understand.

That was the situation for Zechariah, a priest whom the angel Gabriel
appeared to one day near an altar in the temple in Jerusalem. Gabriel
told him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard.
Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John”
(Luke 1:13, italics added).

But Zechariah had probably asked God for a child years before, and he
struggled with Gabriel’s message because Elizabeth was now well beyond
the expected age for childbirth. Still, God answered his prayer.

God’s memory is perfect. He is able to remember our prayers not only
for years but also for generations beyond our lifetime. He never
forgets them and may move in response long after we first brought our
requests to Him. Sometimes His answer is “no,” other times it is
“wait”—but His response is always measured with love. God’s ways are
beyond us, but we can trust that they are good.

Zechariah learned this. He asked for a son, but God gave him even
more. His son John would grow up to be the very prophet who would
announce the arrival of the Messiah.

Zechariah’s experience demonstrates a vital truth that should also
encourage us as we pray: God’s timing is rarely our own, but it is
always worth waiting for.
