A Personal Story

Even if my father and mother abandon me, the Lord will hold me close.
Psalm 27:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 1:22–2:10

A baby just hours old was left in a manger in a Christmas nativity
outside a New York church. A young, desperate mother had wrapped him
warmly and placed him where he would be discovered. If we are tempted
to judge her, we can instead be thankful this baby will now have a
chance in life.

This gets personal for me. As an adopted child myself, I have no idea
about the circumstances surrounding my birth. But I have never felt
abandoned. Of this much I am certain: I have two moms who wanted me to
have a chance in life. One gave life to me; the other invested her
life in me.

In Exodus we read about a loving mother in a desperate situation.
Pharaoh had ordered the murder of all baby boys born to the Jewish
people (1:22). So Moses’s mother hid him as long as she could. When
Moses was three months old, she put him in a watertight basket and
placed the basket in the Nile River. If the plan was to have the baby
rescued by a princess, grow up in Pharaoh’s palace, and eventually
deliver his people out of slavery, it worked perfectly.

When a desperate mother gives her child a chance, God can take it from
there. He has a habit of doing that—in the most creative ways
imaginable.

Reflect & Pray

Father, today we pray for those facing desperate and lonely times. We
pray especially for poor and defenseless children everywhere. Help us
meet their needs as we are able.

Share the love of Christ.
