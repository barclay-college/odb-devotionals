Before the Beginning

You loved me before the creation of the world.
John 17:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 3:13–17

“But if God has no beginning and no end, and has always existed, what
was He doing before He created us? How did He spend His time?” Some
precocious Sunday school student always asks this question when we
talk about God’s eternal nature. I used to respond that this was a bit
of a mystery. But recently I learned that the Bible gives us an answer
to this question.

When Jesus prays to His Father in John 17, He says “Father, . . . you
loved me before the creation of the world” (v. 24). This is God as
revealed to us by Jesus: Before the world was ever created, God was a
trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)—all loving each other and being
loved. When Jesus was baptized, God sent His Spirit in the form of a
dove and said, “This is my Son, whom I love” (Matthew 3:17). The most
foundational aspect of God’s identity is this outgoing, life-giving
love.

What a lovely and encouraging truth this is about our God! The mutual,
outgoing love expressed by each member of the Trinity—Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit—is key to understanding the nature of God. What was God
doing before the beginning of time? What He always does: He was loving
because He is love (1 John 4:8).
