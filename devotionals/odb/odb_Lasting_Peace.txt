Lasting Peace

He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down
the middle wall of separation. —
Ephesians 2:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:13-19

On Christmas Eve 1914, during the First World War, the guns fell
silent along a 30-mile stretch of the Western Front. Soldiers peered
cautiously over the tops of trenches while a few emerged to repair
their positions and bury the dead. As darkness fell, some German
troops set out lanterns and sang Christmas carols. Men on the British
side applauded and shouted greetings.

The next day, German, French, and British troops met in no man’s land
to shake hands, share food, and exchange gifts. It was a brief respite
from war that soon ended when the artillery and machine guns roared to
life again. But no one who experienced “The Christmas Truce,” as it
became known, would ever forget how it felt and how it fueled their
longing for lasting peace.

In Isaiah’s prophecy of the coming Messiah we read, “His name will be
called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of
Peace” (Isa. 9:6). By His death on the cross, Jesus removed the “no
man’s land” between us and God. “For He Himself is our peace” (Eph.
2:14).

In Jesus we can find lasting peace with God and harmony with each
other. This is the life-changing message of Christmas!

Hark! The herald angels sing, “Glory to the newborn King; Peace on
earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled!” —Wesley

Only in Christ can true peace be realized.
