Freedom

Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves
another has fulfilled the law. —
Romans 13:8

Today's Scripture: Romans 13:1-10

Long ago my wife decided that driving within the speed limit gives her
a wonderful sense of freedom. She tells me, “I don’t ever need a radar
detector. And I never have to slow down when I see a state patrol car
or worry about paying a fine for speeding.” Even on long trips when
the miles seem to grind slowly along, she sets the cruise control at
the posted speed limit and enjoys the journey. “Besides,” she reminds
me, “it is the law.”

Romans 13:1-10 addresses our responsibility to the authority of human
government and to the law of God. When we obey the governing
authorities, we don’t have to fear punishment, and we gain a clear
conscience by doing what is right (vv.3,5).

Paul urged the followers of Christ in Rome to give the governing
authorities what was owed them, whether taxes, revenue, respect, or
honor (v.7). But he went beyond human regulations when he wrote: “Owe
no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another
has fulfilled the law” (v.8).

It is our duty to obey man’s law and our privilege to fulfill God’s
law by loving others. And His law is “the perfect law that gives
freedom” (James 1:25 NIV).

Reflect & Pray

God wants us to obey the laws That govern our society; But loving one
another is God’s perfect law that sets us free. —Sper

We keep man’s law by obedience; we fulfill God’s law by love.
