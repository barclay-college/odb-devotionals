Restored Failures

The Lord upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.
Psalm 145:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 145:1–16

A guest band was leading praise and worship at our church, and their
passion for the Lord was moving. We could see—and feel—their
enthusiasm.

Then the musicians revealed that they were all ex-prisoners. Suddenly
their songs took on special meaning, and I saw why their words of
praise meant so much to them. Their worship was a testimony of lives
broken and restored.

The world may embrace success. But stories of past failure offer
people hope too. They assure us that God loves us no matter how many
times we have failed. Pastor Gary Inrig says that what we call the
Hall of Faith in Hebrews 11 could well be entitled God’s Hall of
Reclaimed Failures. “There is scarcely an individual in that chapter
without a serious blemish in his or her life,” he observes. “But God
is in the business of restoring failures . . . . That is a great
principle of God’s grace.”

I love the comfort of Psalm 145, which speaks of God’s “wonderful
works” (vv. 5–6) and glorious kingdom (v. 11). It describes His
compassion (vv. 8–9) and faithfulness (v. 13)—then immediately tells
us that He lifts up those who have fallen (v. 14). All His attributes
are expressed when He picks us up. He is indeed in the business of
restoration.

Have you failed before? We all have. Have you been restored? All who
have been redeemed are stories of God’s grace.
