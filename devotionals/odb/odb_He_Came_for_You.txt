He Came for You

The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to
proclaim good news to the poor.
Luke 4:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 4:14-21

In his novels The Trial and The Castle, Franz Kafka (1883–1924)
portrays life as a dehumanizing existence that turns people into a sea
of empty faces without identity or worth. Kafka said, “The conveyer
belt of life carries you on, no one knows where. One is more of an
object, a thing, than a living creature.”

Early in His ministry, Jesus went to a synagogue in Nazareth, stood up
in front of the crowd, and read from Isaiah: “The Spirit of the Lord
is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.
He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of
sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year
of the Lord’s favor” (Luke 4:18-19).

Then Christ sat down and declared, “Today this scripture is fulfilled
in your hearing” (v. 21). Centuries earlier, the prophet Isaiah had
proclaimed these words (Isa. 61:1-2). Now Jesus announced that He was
the fulfillment of that promise.

Notice who Jesus came to rescue—the poor, brokenhearted, captive,
blind, and oppressed. He came for people dehumanized by sin and
suffering, by brokenness and sorrow. He came for us!

Reflect & Pray

For those who sin and those who suffer. For those who suffer because
of sin. For those who sin to alleviate suffering. Lord, have mercy on
us. Robert Gelinas, The Mercy Prayer

No matter how impersonal the world may seem, Jesus loves each of us as
if we were His only child.
