It’s All About The Love

We have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love.
—
1 John 4:16

Today's Scripture: 1 John 4:7-19

I saw a sign in front of a church that seems to me to be a great motto
for relationships: Receive love. Give love. Repeat.

The greatest love that we receive is the love of God. He loved us so
much that He gave His Son Jesus to live, die, and rise again to redeem
us (1 John 4:9). We receive His love when we receive Jesus as our
Savior and Lord. “As many as received Him, to them He gave the right
to become children of God, to those who believe in His name” (John
1:12).

After we’ve experienced God’s love, we then can learn to give love.
“Let us love one another, for love is of God” (1 John 4:7).

God’s love enables us to love our brothers and sisters in Christ. We
teach, encourage, and rebuke. We weep and rejoice. The love we give is
tender and tough and supportive. We are taught by Jesus even to love
our enemies: “Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who
spitefully use you and persecute you” (Matt. 5:44). Giving love to
others can be challenging in some situations, but it’s possible
because of the love God has first given to us.

A good plan for our lives today: Receive love. Give love. Repeat.

Reflect & Pray

For Further Study How do we experience the love of Christ? (John
15:10). What is the evidence of God’s love in our lives? (1 John
4:16-21). How can we show God’s love today?

Receive love. Give love. Repeat.
