Who’s That Hero?

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works
and glorify your Father in heaven. —
Matthew 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Judges 3:7-11

Reading the book of Judges, with its battles and mighty warriors, can
sometimes feel like reading about comic book superheroes. We have
Deborah, Barak, Gideon, and Samson. However, in the line of judges (or
deliverers), we also find Othniel.

The account of his life is brief and straightforward (Judges 3:7-11).
No drama. No display of prowess. But what we do see is what God did
through Othniel: “The Lord raised up a deliverer” (v.9), “the Spirit
of the Lord came upon him” (v.10), and “the Lord delivered Cushan-
Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand” (v.10).

The Othniel account helps us focus on what is most important—the
activity of God. Interesting stories and fascinating people can
obscure that. We end up concentrating on those and fail to see what
the Lord is doing.

When I was young, I wished I could be more talented so that I could
point more people to Christ. But I was looking at the wrong thing. God
often uses ordinary people for His extraordinary work. It is His light
shining through our lives that glorifies God and draws others to Him
(Matt. 5:16).

When others look at our life, it is more important that they see
God—not us.

May the Word of God dwell richly In my heart from hour to hour, So
that all may see I triumph Only through His power. — Wilkinson

Our limited ability highlights God’s limitless power.
