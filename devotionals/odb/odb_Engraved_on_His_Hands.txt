Engraved on His Hands

See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.
Isaiah 49:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 49:14–18

In Charles Spurgeon’s many years at his London church during the
1800s, he loved to preach on the riches of Isaiah 49:16, which says
that God engraves us on the palms of His hands. He said, “Such a text
as this is to be preached hundreds of times!” This thought is so
precious that we can run over it in our minds again and again.

Spurgeon makes the wonderful connection between this promise of the
Lord to His people, the Israelites, and God’s Son, Jesus, on the cross
as He died for us. Spurgeon asked, “What are these wounds in Your
hands? . . . The engraver’s tool was the nail, backed by the hammer.
He must be fastened to the Cross, that His people might be truly
engraved on the palms of His hands.” As the Lord promised to engrave
His people on His palms, so Jesus stretched out His arms on the cross,
receiving the nails in His hands so we could be free of our sins.

If and when we’re tempted to think that God has forgotten us, we only
need to look at our palms and remember God’s promise. He has put
indelible marks on His hands for us; He loves us that much.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, how vast is Your love for me! You keep me ever before You. I
know You’ll never leave me, and I’m grateful.

The Lord engraves us on the palms of His hands.
