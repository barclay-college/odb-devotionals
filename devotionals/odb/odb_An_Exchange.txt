An Exchange

I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,” and you
forgave the guilt of my sin. —
Psalm 32:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 32

Jen sat on her patio pondering a scary question: Should she write a
book? She had enjoyed writing a blog and speaking in public but felt
God might want her to do more. “I asked God if He wanted me to do
this,” she said. She talked with Him and asked for His leading.

She began to wonder if God wanted her to write about her husband’s
pornography addiction and how God was working in his life and their
marriage. But then she thought that it might publicly disrespect him.
So she prayed, “What if we wrote it together?” and she asked her
husband Craig. He agreed.

While he didn’t say what sin he committed, King David engaged in a
public conversation about his struggles. He even put them into song.
“When I kept silent, my bones wasted away,” he wrote (Ps. 32:3 niv).
So he said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord” (v. 5). Not
everyone should go public with their private battles. But when David
confessed his sin, he found peace and healing that inspired him to
worship God.

Craig and Jen say that the process of writing their deeply personal
story has brought them closer than ever. How like God, who loves to
exchange our guilt, shame, and isolation for His forgiveness, courage,
and community!

Reflect & Pray

Do you need to make an exchange with God of guilt for forgiveness? He
is listening.

God forgives those who confess their guilt.
