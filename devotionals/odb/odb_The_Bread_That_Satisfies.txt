The Bread That Satisfies

Give us each day our daily bread.
Luke 11:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 10:38-11:4

I learned to recite the Lord’s Prayer as a boy in primary school.
Every time I said the line, “Give us today our daily bread” (Matt.
6:11), I couldn’t help but think about the bread that we got only
occasionally at home. Only when my father returned from his trip into
town did we have a loaf of bread. So asking God to give us our daily
bread was a relevant prayer to me.

How curious I was when years later I discovered the booklet Our Daily
Bread. I knew the title came from the Lord’s Prayer, but I also knew
it couldn’t be talking about the loaf of bread from the baker’s shop.
I discovered as I read the booklet regularly that this “bread,” full
of Scripture portions and helpful notes, was spiritual food for the
soul.

It was spiritual food that Mary chose when she sat at the feet of
Jesus and listened attentively to His words (Luke 10:39). While Martha
wearied herself with concern about physical food, Mary was taking time
to be near their guest, the Lord Jesus, and to listen to Him. May we
take that time as well. He is the Bread of Life (John 6:35), and He
feeds our hearts with spiritual food. He is the Bread that satisfies.

Reflect & Pray

I sit before You now, Lord, and want to learn from You. My heart is
open to hear from You in Your Word. Teach me. Feed me.

“I am the bread of life.” Jesus
