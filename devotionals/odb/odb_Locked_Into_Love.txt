Locked Into Love

Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.
Psalm 106:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:31–39

In June 2015, the city of Paris removed forty-five tons of padlocks
from the railings of the Pont des Arts pedestrian bridge. As a
romantic gesture, couples would etch their initials onto a lock,
attach it to the railing, click it shut, and throw the key into the
River Seine.

After this ritual was repeated thousands of times, the bridge could no
longer bear the weight of so much “love.” Eventually the city, fearing
for the integrity of the bridge, removed the “love locks.”

The locks were meant to symbolize everlasting love, but human love
does not always last. The closest of friends may offend each other and
never resolve their differences. Family members may argue and refuse
to forgive. A husband and wife may drift so far apart that they can’t
remember why they once decided to marry. Human love can be fickle.

But there is one constant and enduring love—the love of God. “Give
thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever,”
proclaims Psalm 106:1. The promises of the unfailing and everlasting
nature of God’s love are found throughout Scripture. And the greatest
proof of this love is the death of His Son so that those who put their
faith in Him can live eternally. And nothing will ever separate us
from His love (Rom. 8:38–39).

Fellow believers, we are locked into God’s love forever.

I’m grateful for Your unending love, Father. I’m locked into Your love
by the Holy Spirit who is living in me.

Christ’s death and resurrection are the measure of God’s love for me.
