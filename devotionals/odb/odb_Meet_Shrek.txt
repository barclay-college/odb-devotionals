Meet Shrek

I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out. —
Ezekiel 34:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ezekiel 34:11-16

Shrek was a renegade sheep. He went missing from his flock and
remained lost for 6 years. The person who found him living in a cave
on a high and rugged place in New Zealand didn’t recognize him as a
sheep. “He looked like some biblical creature,” he said. In a way, he
was. Shrek was a picture of what happens to sheep who become separated
from their shepherd.

Shrek had to be carried down the mountain because his fleece was so
heavy (60 lbs or 27 kg) that he couldn’t walk down on his own. To
relieve Shrek of the weight of his waywardness, he was turned upside
down so that he would remain still and not be harmed when the shearer
removed his heavy fleece.

Shrek’s story illustrates the metaphor Jesus used when He called
Himself the Good Shepherd (John 10:11), and when God referred to His
people as His flock (Ezek. 34:31). Like Shrek, we do not make good
choices when we’re on our own, and we become weighed down with the
consequences (Ezek. 33:10). To relieve us of the weight, we may have
to be on our backs for a time. When we end up in this position, it is
good to remain still and trust the Good Shepherd to do His work
without hurting us.

The King of love my Shepherd is, Whose goodness faileth never; I
nothing lack if I am His, And He is mine forever. —Baker
