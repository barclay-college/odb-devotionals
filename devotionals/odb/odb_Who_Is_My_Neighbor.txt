Who Is My Neighbor?

Go and do likewise.
Luke 10:37

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 10:30-37

Mary enjoyed her midweek church group meeting when she and several
friends gathered to pray, worship, and discuss questions from the
previous week’s sermon. This week they were going to talk about the
difference between “going” to church and “being” the church in a
hurting world. She was looking forward to seeing her friends and
having a lively discussion.

As she picked up her car keys, the doorbell rang. “I’m so sorry to
bother you,” said her neighbor Sue, “but are you free this morning?”
Mary was about to say that she was going out when Sue continued, “I
have to take my car to the repair shop. Normally I would walk or cycle
home, but I’ve hurt my back and can’t do either at the moment.” Mary
hesitated for a heartbeat and then smiled. “Of course,” she said.

Mary knew her neighbor only by sight. But as she drove her home, she
learned about Sue’s husband’s battle with dementia and the utter
exhaustion that being a caregiver can bring with it. She listened,
sympathized, and promised to pray. She offered to help in any way she
could.

Mary didn’t get to church that morning to talk about sharing her
faith. Instead she took a little bit of Jesus’ love to her neighbor
who was in a difficult situation.
