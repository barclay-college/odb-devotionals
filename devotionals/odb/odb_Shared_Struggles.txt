Shared Struggles

Share each other’s burdens, and in this way obey the law of
Christ. —nlt
Galatians 6:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 6:1-10

April 25, 2015, marked the 100th commemoration of Anzac Day. It is
celebrated each year by both Australia and New Zealand to honor the
members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who
fought together during World War I. It marks a time when neither
country had to face the dangers of war alone; soldiers from both
countries engaged in the struggle together.

Sharing life’s struggles is fundamental to the way followers of Christ
are called to live. As Paul challenged us, “Share each other’s
burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ” (Gal. 6:2 nlt). By
working together through life’s challenges we can help to strengthen
and support one another when times are hard. By expressing toward one
another the care and affections of Christ, the difficulties of life
should draw us to Christ and to each other—not isolate us in our
suffering.

By sharing in the struggles of another, we are modeling the love of
Christ. We read in Isaiah, “Surely He has borne our griefs and carried
our sorrows” (Isa. 53:4 nkjv). No matter how great the struggle we
face, we never face it alone.
