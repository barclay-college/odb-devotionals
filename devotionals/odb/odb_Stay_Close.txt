Stay Close

Comfort each other and edify one another. —
1 Thessalonians 5:11

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 4:7-11

My friend and I were traveling together, and she seemed a bit
frazzled. When we got to the airport, she forgot to have her
identification readily available and couldn’t find her reservation
confirmation number. The ticket agent waited patiently, smiled, and
then helped her at the “self” check-in. After receiving her ticket,
she asked, “Where do we go next?” The agent smiled again, pointed at
me, and said to her, “Stay close to your friend.”

That can be good advice for all of us when our lives get frazzled—stay
close to your friends. Although Jesus is our best friend, we also need
relationships with fellow believers to help us survive in this life.

In his first epistle, Peter was writing to believers who needed one
another because they were suffering for their faith. In a few short
sentences in chapter 4, Peter mentioned the need to receive and give
“fervent love,” prayer, and hospitality (vv.7-9). He also included the
need for believers to use their spiritual gifts to minister to one
another (v.10). In other passages, we’re encouraged to comfort each
other with the comfort we’ve been given by God (2 Cor. 1:3-4) and to
build each other up in love (1 Thess. 5:11).

When life gets difficult and we get frazzled, staying close to our
Christian friends will help us to get through.

Reflect & Pray

When our friends encounter trials, We can help them if we’re near;
Some may need a word of comfort, Others just a listening ear. —Sper

Staying close to godly friends helps us to stay close to God.
