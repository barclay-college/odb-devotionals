Hovering Over Us

He shielded him and cared for him . . . like an eagle that . . .
hovers over its young.
Deuteronomy 32:10–11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 32:7–12

Betty’s daughter arrived home from an overseas trip, feeling unwell.
When her pain became unbearable, Betty and her husband took her to the
emergency room. The doctors and nurses set to work, and after a few
hours one of the nurses said to Betty, “She’s going to be okay! We’re
going to take good care of her and get her healed up.” In that moment,
Betty felt peace and love flood over her. She realized that while she
hovered over her daughter anxiously, the Lord is the perfect parent
who nurtures His children, comforting us in difficult times.

In the book of Deuteronomy, the Lord reminded His people how, when
they were wandering in the desert, He cared for them as a loving
parent who hovers over its young. He never left them, but was like an
eagle “that spreads its wings” to catch its children and “carries them
aloft” (32:11). He wanted them to remember that although they
experienced hardship and strife in the desert, He didn’t abandon them.

We too may face challenges of many kinds, but we can take comfort and
courage in this reminder that our God will never leave us. When we
feel that we are falling, the Lord like an eagle will spread His wings
to catch us (v. 11) as He brings us peace.

Reflect & Pray

Father God, Your love as a parent is greater than anything I can
imagine. May my confidence rest in You, and may I share Your love with
others.

Our God hovers over us with love.
