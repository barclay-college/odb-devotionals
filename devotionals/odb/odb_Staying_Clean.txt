Staying Clean

Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.
—
Psalm 119:11

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:9-16

During a business trip to Philadelphia, I walked down Broad Street
toward City Hall each morning to catch the subway. Each day I passed a
long line of people waiting for something. They were a cross-section
of humanity in age, ethnic origin, and appearance. After wondering
about it for 3 days, I asked a man on the sidewalk why all those
people were standing in line. He told me that they were on probation
or parole after breaking the law and had to take a daily drug test to
show that they were staying clean.

This struck me as a vivid illustration of my need to stay spiritually
clean before God. When the psalmist pondered how he could live a pure
life, he concluded that the key was to consider and obey God’s
teaching. “Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin
against You. Blessed are You, O Lord! Teach me Your statutes. . . . I
will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your Word”
(Ps. 119:11-12,16).

In the light of God’s Word, we see our sin, but we also see God’s love
in Christ. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).

By His grace . . . staying clean.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, grant that we may hear You speak As truth within Your Word we
seek; And may it show us all our sin And make us clean without,
within. —D. De Haan

Read the Bible to be wise, believe it to be safe, practice it to be
