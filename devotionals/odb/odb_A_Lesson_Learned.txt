A Lesson Learned

I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
Philippians 4:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:10–19

Mary was widowed and facing serious health challenges when her
daughter invited her to move into the new “granny apartment” attached
to her home. Although it would involve leaving friends and the rest of
her family many miles away, Mary rejoiced in God’s provision.

Six months into her new life, the initial joy and contentment
threatened to slip away as she was tempted to grumble inwardly and
doubt whether the move was really God’s perfect plan. She missed her
Christian friends, and her new church was too far away to get to
independently.

Then she read something that the great 19th-century preacher Charles
Spurgeon had written. “Now contentment is one of the flowers of
heaven, and it must be cultivated,” he pointed out. “Paul says . . .
‘I have learned to be content,’ as if he didn’t know how at one time.”

Mary concluded that if an ardent evangelist like Paul, confined to
prison, abandoned by friends, and facing execution could learn
contentment, then so could she.

“I realized that until I could learn this lesson, I wouldn’t enjoy
those things God had planned,” she said. “So I confessed my inward
grumbling and asked for His forgiveness. Soon after that a newly
retired lady asked if I would be her prayer partner, and others
offered me a ride to church. My needs for a ‘soul friend’ and greater
mobility were wonderfully met.”
