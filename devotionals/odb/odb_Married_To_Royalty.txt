Married To Royalty

The marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself
ready. —
Revelation 19:7

Today's Scripture: Revelation 19:6-9

The book To Marry an English Lord chronicles the 19th-century
phenomenon of rich American heiresses who sought marriages to British
aristocracy. Although they were already wealthy, they wanted the
social status of royalty. The book begins with Prince Albert, son of
Queen Victoria, going to the United States to pay a social call. A
mass of wealthy heiresses flood into a ball arranged for Prince
Albert, each hoping to become his royal bride.

Believers in Christ don’t have to just hope—they are assured of a
royal marriage in heaven. John talks about it in the book of
Revelation: “Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the
marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.
And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and
bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints”
(19:7-8). Jesus is the Lamb, who is the Bridegroom talked about in
that Scripture, and believers are His bride.

As the bride of Christ, we are to make ourselves “ready” for that day
by striving to live close to Him now in anticipation of our future
with Him in heaven. There we will “be glad and rejoice and give . . .
glory” (v.7) to the King of kings and Lord of lords!

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, we look forward to that day when we will be with You! We want
to be ready, but we know we can’t live a life that is pure unless You
are in us and help us. Change us and fill us.

There is no greater privilege than to know the King of kings.
