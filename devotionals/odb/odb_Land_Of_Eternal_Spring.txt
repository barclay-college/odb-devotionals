Land Of Eternal Spring

I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous
forsaken. —
Psalm 37:25

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 12:1-7

The former president of Columbia Bible College in South Carolina, J.
Robertson McQuilkin, pointed out that God has a wise purpose in
letting us grow old and weak:

“I think God has planned the strength and beauty of youth to be
physical. But the strength and beauty of age is spiritual. We
gradually lose the strength and beauty that is temporary so we’ll be
sure to concentrate on the strength and beauty which is forever. And
so we’ll be eager to leave the temporary, deteriorating part of us and
be truly homesick for our eternal home. If we stayed young and strong
and beautiful, we might never want to leave.”

When we are young, happily occupied with all our relationships and
activities, we may not long for our celestial Home. But as time
passes, we may find ourselves without family and friends, afflicted
with dim vision and hearing difficulties, no longer able to relish
food, or troubled by sleeplessness.

Here’s the advice I give myself: Be grateful that, as the apostle Paul
wrote in 1 Timothy 6:17, “God . . . gives us richly all things to
enjoy” in life’s summer and autumn. And rejoice too that with the
onset of life’s winter we can anticipate that we’ll soon be living in
the land of eternal spring.

Reflect & Pray

There’s a land that is fairer than day, And by faith we can see it
afar; For the Father waits over the way, To prepare us a dwelling-
place there. —Bennett

The promise of heaven is our eternal hope.
