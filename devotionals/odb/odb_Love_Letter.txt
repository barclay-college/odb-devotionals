Love Letter

Oh, how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day. —
Psalm 119:97

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:97-104

Each morning when I reach my office, I have one simple habit—check all
my emails. Most of the time, I’ll work through them in a perfunctory
fashion. There are some emails, however, that I’m eager to open. You
guessed it—those from loved ones.

Someone has said that the Bible is God’s love letter to us. But
perhaps on some days, like me, you just don’t feel like opening it and
your heart doesn’t resonate with the words of the psalmist: “Oh, how I
love Your law!” (Ps. 119:97). The Scriptures are “Your commandments”
(v.98), “Your testimonies” (v.99), “Your precepts” (v.100), “Your
word” (v.101, emphasis added).

A question by Thomas Manton (1620–1677), once a lecturer at
Westminster Abbey, still holds relevance for us today. He asked: “Who
is the author of Scripture? God. . . . What is the end of Scripture?
God. Why was the Scripture written, but that we might everlastingly
enjoy the blessed God?”

It is said of some people that the more you know them the less you
admire them; but the reverse is true of God. Familiarity with the Word
of God, or rather the God of the Word, breeds affection, and affection
seeks yet greater familiarity.

As you open your Bible, remember that God—the One who loves you the
most—has a message for you.

Reflect & Pray

Oh, may I love Thy precious Word, May I explore the mine, May I its
fragrant flowers glean, May light upon me shine! —Hodder

Knowing the Bible helps us know the God of the Bible.
