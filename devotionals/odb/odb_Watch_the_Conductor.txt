Watch the Conductor

Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our
eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.
Hebrews 12:1–2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 12:1–3

World-renowned violinist, Joshua Bell, has an unusual way of
leading the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, a forty-four-member
chamber orchestra. Instead of waving a baton he directs while playing
his Stradivarius with the other violinists. Bell told Colorado Public
Radio, “Even while I’m playing I can give them all kinds of direction
and signals that I think only they would understand at this point.
They know by every little dip in my violin, or raise in my eyebrow, or
the way I draw the bow. They know the sound I’m looking for from the
entire orchestra.”

Just as the orchestra members watch Joshua Bell, the Bible instructs
us to keep our eyes on Jesus our Lord. After listing many heroes of
the faith in Hebrews 11, the writer says, “Therefore, since we are
surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off
everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let
us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes
on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith”  (Heb. 12:1–2).

Jesus promised, “I am with you always, to the very end of the age”
(Matt. 28:20). Because He is, we have the amazing privilege of keeping
our eyes on Him while He conducts the music of our lives.
