An Escort Through The Valley

O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory? —
1 Corinthians 15:55

Today's Scripture: Psalm 23

I’ve heard people say, “I’m not afraid of death because I’m confident
that I’m going to heaven; it’s the dying process that scares me!” Yes,
as Christians, we look forward to heaven but may be afraid of dying.
We need not be ashamed to admit that. It is natural to be afraid of
the pain that comes with dying, of being separated from our loved
ones, of possibly impoverishing our families, and of regret over
missed earthly opportunities.

Why don’t Christians need to be afraid of death? Because Jesus was
raised from the grave, and we who are in Christ will also be raised.
That is why in 1 Corinthians 15:56-57, Paul proclaimed: “The sting of
death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to
God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

The dying process itself is but an escort that ushers us into eternity
with God. As we “walk through the valley of the shadow of death,” we
can have this confidence from God’s Word: “You are with me; Your rod
and Your staff, they comfort me” (Ps. 23:4). The picture here is of
the Lord coming alongside us, giving comfort and direction as He
escorts us through the dark valley to the “house of the Lord.” There
we will dwell with Him forever (v.6).

Reflect & Pray

Think of just crossing a river, Stepping out safe on that shore,
Sadness and suffering over, Dwelling with Christ evermore! —Anon.

Death is the last shadow before heaven’s dawn.
