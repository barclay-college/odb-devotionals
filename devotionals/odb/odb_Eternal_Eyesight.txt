Eternal Eyesight

We do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which
are not seen. —
2 Corinthians 4:18

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 4:16–5:8

I received good news at my eye checkup last month—my faraway vision
has improved. Well, I thought it was good news until a friend informed
me: “Faraway vision can improve as we age; close-up vision may
diminish.”

The report made me think of another kind of improved faraway vision
that I have observed in some Christians. Those who have known the Lord
for a long time or who have gone through great trials seem to have a
better heavenly vision than the rest of us. Their eternal eyesight has
gotten better and their close-up “earthly” vision is diminishing.

Because the apostle Paul had that type of eternal vision, he
encouraged the church in Corinth: “Our light affliction, which is but
for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory . . . . The things which are seen are temporary, but
the things which are not seen are eternal” (2 Cor. 4:17-18).

For now we struggle with our “eyesight.” There’s a tension between
enjoying all that God has given us in this life, yet still believing
what theologian Jonathan Edwards said about our future: “To go to
heaven, fully to enjoy God, is infinitely better than the most
pleasant accommodations here.” Seeing Him will bring perfect vision.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we know that our life on this earth is but a moment compared to
eternity. Help us to enjoy the time we’ve been given, and use us to
tell of Your love and goodness until that day when we see You.

Keep your eyes fixed on the prize.
