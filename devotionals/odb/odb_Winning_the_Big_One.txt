Winning the Big One

I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called
me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 3:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:7-14

In every field of endeavor, one award is considered the epitome of
recognition and success. An Olympic gold medal, a Grammy, an Academy
Award, or a Nobel Prize are among “the big ones.” But there is a
greater prize that anyone can obtain.

The apostle Paul was familiar with first-century athletic games in
which competitors gave their full effort to win the prize. With that
in mind, he wrote to a group of followers of Christ in Philippi:
“Whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ”
(Phil. 3:7). Why? Because his heart had embraced a new goal: “I want
to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and
participation in his sufferings” (v. 10). And so, Paul said, “I press
on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me” (v.
12). His trophy for completing the race would be the “crown of
righteousness” (2 Tim. 4:8).

Each of us can aim for that same prize, knowing that we honor the Lord
in pursuing it. Every day, in our ordinary duties, we are moving
toward “the big one”—“the heavenly prize for which God, through Christ
Jesus, is calling us” (Phil. 3:14 nlt).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, when I get discouraged, help me to keep pressing on,
looking ahead to when I will be with You forever.

What is done for Christ in this life will be rewarded in the life to
come.
