Amazing Love

I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of
him who sent me.
John 6:38

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 6:32-40

Approaching the first Christmas after her husband died, our friend
Davidene wrote a remarkable letter in which she pictured what it might
have been like in heaven when Jesus was born on earth. “It was what
God always knew would happen,” she wrote. “The three were one, and He
had agreed to allow the fracturing of His precious unity for our sake.
Heaven was left empty of God the Son.”

As Jesus taught and healed people on earth, He said, “I have come down
from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. .
. . For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and
believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at
the last day” (John 6:38,40).

When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, it was the beginning of His mission
on earth to demonstrate God’s love and give His life on the cross to
free us from the penalty and power of sin.

“I cannot imagine actually choosing to let go of the one I loved, with
whom I was one, for the sake of anyone else,” Davidene concluded. “But
God did. He faced a house much emptier than mine, so that I could live
in His house with Him forever.”

“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son” (John
3:16).

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, we are in awe of Your amazing love for us. Thank You
for giving Your only Son to save us from our sins.

The birth of Christ brought God to man; the cross of Christ brings man
to God.
