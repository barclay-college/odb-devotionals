Living in the Light

The darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.
1 John 2:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 2:3–11

It was a dark morning. Low, steel-colored clouds filled the sky, and
the atmosphere was so dim that I needed to turn on the lights in order
to read a book. I had just settled in when the room suddenly filled
with light. I looked up and saw that the wind was pushing the clouds
to the east, clearing the sky and revealing the sun.

As I went to the window to get a better look at the drama, a thought
came to mind: “The darkness is passing and the true light is already
shining” (1 John 2:8). The apostle John wrote these words to believers
as a message of encouragement. He went on to say, “Anyone who loves
their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in
them to make them stumble” (v. 10). By contrast, he equated hating
people with roaming around in darkness. Hatred is disorienting; it
takes away our sense of moral direction.

Loving people is not always easy. Yet I was reminded as I looked
out the window that frustration, forgiveness, and faithfulness are all
part of maintaining a deep connection with the love and light of God.
When we choose love instead of hate, we are showing our relationship
with Him and reflecting His radiance to the world around us. “God is
light; in him there is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, help me to experience Your love more fully so that I can
share it with others. I want to live in the light of Your grace and
mercy.

Choosing to love people well shows the world what God is like.
