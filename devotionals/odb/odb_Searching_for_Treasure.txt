Searching for Treasure

[Wisdom] is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than
gold.
Proverbs 3:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 4:5–19

Buried treasure. It sounds like something out of a children’s
storybook. But eccentric millionaire Forrest Fenn claims to have left
a box of jewels and gold, worth up to $2 million, somewhere in the
Rocky Mountains. Many people have gone in search of it. In fact, four
people have lost their lives trying to find the hidden riches.

The author of Proverbs gives us reason to stop and think: Does any
kind of treasure merit such a quest? In Proverbs 4, a father writing
to his sons about how to live well suggests that wisdom is one thing
worth seeking at any cost (v. 7). Wisdom, he says, will lead us
through life, keep us from stumbling, and crown us with honor (vv.
8–12). Writing hundreds of years later, James, half-brother of Jesus
and leader in the early church, also emphasized the importance of
wisdom. “The wisdom that comes from heaven,” he writes, “is first of
all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy
and good fruit, impartial and sincere” (James 3:17). When we seek
wisdom, we find all kinds of good things flourishing in our lives.

To seek wisdom is ultimately to seek God, the source of all wisdom and
understanding. And the wisdom that comes from above is worth more than
any buried treasure we could ever imagine.
