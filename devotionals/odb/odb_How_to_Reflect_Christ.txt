How to Reflect Christ

God has chosen to make known . . . the glorious riches of this
mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
Colossians 1:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:25–27

Thérèse of Lisieux was a joyful and carefree child—until her mother
died when she was just four years old. She became timid and easily
agitated. But many years later on Christmas Eve, all of that changed.
After celebrating the birth of Jesus with her church community, she
experienced God releasing her from her fear and giving her joy. She
attributed the change to the power of God leaving heaven and becoming
a man, Jesus, and through His dwelling in her.

What does it mean for Christ to dwell within us? It’s a mystery, said
Paul to the Colossian church. It’s one that God “kept hidden for ages
and generations” (Colossians 1:26), but which He disclosed to God’s
people. To them God revealed “the glorious riches of this mystery,
which is Christ in you, the hope of glory” (v. 27). Because Christ now
dwelled in the Colossians, they experienced the joy of new life. No
longer were they enslaved to the old self of sin.

If we’ve asked Jesus to be our Savior, we too live out this mystery of
His dwelling in us. Through His Spirit, He can release us from fear,
as He did Thérèse, and grow within us the fruit of His Spirit, such as
joy, peace, and self-control (Galatians 5:22–23).

Let’s give thanks for the wonderful mystery of Christ within us.
