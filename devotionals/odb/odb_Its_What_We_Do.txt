It’s What We Do

Whoever fears the Lord has a secure fortress, and for their children
it will be a refuge. —niv
Proverbs 14:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 112

My father was critically injured when he took a bullet in the leg as a
second lieutenant leading his men on Hill 609 in North Africa during
World War II. Dad was never again 100 percent physically. I was born
several years after this, and when I was young I didn’t even know he
had been wounded. I found out later when someone told me. Although he
felt constant pain in his leg, my dad never complained about it, and
he never used it as an excuse for not providing for our family.

My parents loved the Savior and raised us to love, trust, and serve
Him. Through good times and bad, they simply trusted God, worked hard,
and loved us unconditionally. Proverbs 14:26 says that “Whoever fears
the Lord has a secure fortress, and for their children it will be a
refuge” (niv). My dad did that for our family. No matter what
difficulties he faced, he provided a safe place for us spiritually,
emotionally, and physically.

We parents can provide a safe haven for our families with the help of
our perfect heavenly Father, whose love for His children is deep and
eternal.
