Little Lies and Kittens

Just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God’s
wonderful grace rules instead.
Romans 5:21 NLT

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:12–21

Mom noticed four-year-old Elias as he scurried away from the newborn
kittens. She had told him not to touch them. “Did you touch the
kitties, Elias?” she asked.

“No!” he said earnestly. So Mom had another question: “Were they
soft?”

“Yes,” he volunteered, “and the black one mewed.”

With a toddler, we smile at such duplicity. But Elias’s disobedience
underscores our human condition. No one has to teach a four-year-old
to lie. “For I was born a sinner,” wrote David in his classic
confession, “yes, from the moment my mother conceived me” (Ps. 51:5
nlt). The apostle Paul said: “When Adam sinned, sin entered the world.
Adam’s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone
sinned” (Rom. 5:12 nlt). That depressing news applies equally to
kings, four-year-olds, and you and me.

But there’s plenty of hope! “God’s law was given so that all people
could see how sinful they were,” wrote Paul. “But as people sinned
more and more, God’s wonderful grace became more abundant” (Rom. 5:20
nlt).

God is not waiting for us to blow it so He can pounce on us. He is in
the business of grace, forgiveness, and restoration. We need only
recognize that our sin is neither cute nor excusable and come to Him
in faith and repentance.
