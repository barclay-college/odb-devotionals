It Never Runs Out

He has given us new birth into . . . an inheritance that can never
perish.
1 Peter 1:3–4

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 1:3–9

When I asked a friend who is about to retire what she feared about her
next stage of life, she said, “I want to make sure I don’t run out of
money.” The next day as I was talking to my financial counselor he
gave me advice on how I might avoid running out of money. Indeed, we
all want the security of knowing we’ll have the resources we need for
the rest of our lives.

No financial plan can provide an absolute guarantee of earthly
security. But there is a plan that extends far beyond this life and
indefinitely into the future. The apostle Peter describes it like
this: “In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an
inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade” (1 Peter 1:3–4).

When we place our faith in Jesus to forgive our sins we receive an
eternal inheritance through God’s power. Because of this inheritance,
we’ll live forever and never run short of what we need.

Planning for retirement is a good idea if we’re able to do so. But
more important is having an eternal inheritance that never runs
out—and that is available only through faith in Jesus Christ.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, I want that assurance of an eternal inheritance—the
certainty of everlasting life with You. I put my faith in Jesus to
forgive my sins and make me His child. Thank You for saving me and
reserving a place for me in Your eternal kingdom.

The promise of heaven is our eternal hope.
