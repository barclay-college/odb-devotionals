I’m Invisible

[The Lord] gives power to the weak. —
Isaiah 40:29

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 40:25-31

My friend Jane said something at a work meeting and no one responded.
So she repeated it and again no one responded; her co-workers just
ignored her. She realized that her opinion didn’t matter much. She
felt disregarded and invisible. You may know what that’s like as well.

The people of God felt that way as a nation (Isa. 40). Only they
believed it was God Himself who didn’t see or understand their daily
struggle to survive! In this prophecy of Isaiah, the southern kingdom
has been carried away captive into Babylon, and the exiled nation
complains: “My way is hidden from the Lord, and my just claim is
passed over by my God” (v.27).

While Isaiah agreed that compared to God “the nations are as a drop in
a bucket, and are counted as the small dust on the scales” (v.15), he
also wanted the people to know that God gives power to the weak and
strength to those who need it (v.29). If they waited on the Lord,
Isaiah said, He would renew their strength. They would mount up with
wings like eagles; they would run and not be weary (v.31).

When you’re feeling invisible or disregarded, remember that God does
see you and He cares. Wait on Him, and He’ll give you renewed
strength.

Reflect & Pray

Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, In Thee do we trust, nor
find Thee to fail. Thy mercies how tender! How firm to the end! Our
Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend. —Grant

Even when we don’t sense God’s presence, His loving care is all around
us.
