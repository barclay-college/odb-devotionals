Love of Another Kind

My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.
John 15:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 15:9–17

One of my favorite churches started several years ago as a ministry to
ex-prisoners who were transitioning back into society. Now the church
flourishes with people from all walks of life. I love that church
because it reminds me of what I picture heaven will be like—filled
with different kinds of people, all redeemed sinners, all bound
together by the love of Jesus.

Sometimes, though, I wonder if church seems more like an exclusive
club than a safe haven for forgiven sinners. As people naturally
gravitate into groups of “a certain kind” and cluster around those
they feel comfortable with, it leaves others feeling marginalized. But
that’s not what Jesus had in mind when He told His disciples to “love
each other as I have loved you” (John 15:12). His church was to be an
extension of His love mutually shared with all.

If hurting, rejected people can find loving refuge, comfort, and
forgiveness in Jesus, they should expect no less from the church. So
let’s exhibit the love of Jesus to everyone we encounter—especially
those who are not like us. All around us are people Jesus wants to
love through us. What a joy it is when people unite to worship
together in love—a slice of heaven we can enjoy here on earth!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, remind me today that while I was a sinner You embraced me with
Your deep and unconditional love and brought me into the fellowship of
Your grace. Lead me to someone I can love as You loved me.

Share Christ’s love with another.
