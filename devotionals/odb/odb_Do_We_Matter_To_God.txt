Do We Matter To God?

In an acceptable time I have heard You, and in the day of salvation I
have helped You. —
Isaiah 49:8

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 49:8-18

When I consider Your heavens,” wrote the psalmist, “what is man that
You are mindful of him?” (Ps. 8:3-4). The Old Testament circles around
this question. Toiling in Egypt, the Hebrew slaves could hardly
believe Moses’ assurances that God would concern Himself with them.
The writer of Ecclesiastes phrased the question more cynically: Does
anything matter?

I was entertaining that same doubt myself when I received an
invitation to address a conference on the theme: “I have inscribed you
on the palms of My hands” (Isa. 49:16).

God made this stirring declaration to people suffering through a low
point in their history as Isaiah prophesies that they would be taken
away captive to Babylon. Hearing this, the people lamented, “The Lord
has forsaken me, and . . . forgotten me” (Isa. 49:14). To this
lamentation God gave a series of promises—the Servant Songs (Isa.
42–53)—in which He sets the stage of hope for deliverance from hostile
enemies. He foretells of the incarnation and sacrificial death of the
Servant.

Do we matter to God? Christmas memorializes God’s answer: “Behold, the
virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name
Immanuel” (7:14).

Love brought Him down from the glory, Love made Him come from the sky;
Love in His heart for the sinner Led Him to suffer and die. —Anon.

The fact of Jesus’ coming is the final and unanswerable proof that God
cares. — Barclay
