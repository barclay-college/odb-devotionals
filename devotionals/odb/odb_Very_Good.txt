Very Good!

Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was very
good!
Genesis 1:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 1:24–31

Some days seem to have a theme running through them. Recently I had
one of those days. Our pastor began his sermon on Genesis 1 with two
minutes of breathtaking, time-lapse photography of blossoming flowers.
Then, at home, a scroll through social media revealed numerous posts
of flowers. Later on a walk in the woods, the wildflowers of spring
surrounded us—trilliums, marsh marigolds, and wild iris.

God created flowers and every other variety of vegetation (and dry
ground to grow in), on the third day of creation. And twice on that
day, God pronounced it “good” (Gen. 1:10, 12). On only one other day
of creation—the sixth—did God make that double pronouncement of “good”
(vv. 25, 31). In fact, on this day when He created humans and His
masterpiece was complete, He looked over all He had made and “saw that
it was very good!” (nlt).

In the creation story, we see a Creator God who delighted in His
creation—and seemed to take joy in the very act of creating. Why else
design a world with such colorful and amazing variety? And He saved
the best for last when He “created mankind in his own image” (v. 27).
As His image-bearers we are blessed and inspired by His beautiful
handiwork.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Creator God, thank You for creating the world in all its beauty
for our enjoyment—and Yours. Thank You too for making us in Your image
so that we would be inspired to create.

All creation bears God’s autograph.
