Hold On

Stand firm in the Lord.
Philippians 4:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:12–4:1

Tianmen Mountain in Zhangjiajie, China, is considered one of the most
beautiful mountains in the world. To view its towering cliffs in all
their glorious splendor, you must take the Tianmen Shan cable car,
which covers a distance of 7,455 meters (4.5 miles). It’s amazing how
this cable car can travel such long distances and scale such steep
mountains without any motor on the car itself. Yet it moves safely up
these spectacular heights by keeping a strong grip on a cable that is
moved by a powerful motor.

In our journey of faith, how can we finish the race well and “press on
toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called [us]
heavenward in Christ Jesus”? (Phil. 3:14). Like the cable car, we keep
a strong grip on Christ, which is what Paul meant when he said “stand
firm in the Lord” (4:1). We have no resources of our own. We depend
fully on Christ to keep us moving forward. He will take us through the
greatest challenges and lead us safely home.

Toward the end of his earthly life, the apostle Paul declared, “I have
fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the
faith” (2 Tim. 4:7). You can too. Simply keep a strong grip on Christ.

Reflect & Pray

We’re grateful, Lord, that while we aim to keep a strong grip on You,
You always keep a strong grip on us! You are working in us and giving
us what we need to continue trusting You on our faith journey.

Keeping the faith means trusting God to faithfully keep you.
