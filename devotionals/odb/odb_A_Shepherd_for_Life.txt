A Shepherd for Life

God . . . has been my shepherd all my life to this day.
Genesis 48:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 48:8–16

When my son changed grades in school he cried, “I want my teacher for
life!” We had to help him realize that changing teachers is a part of
life. We may wonder: Is there any relationship that can last a
lifetime?

Jacob, the patriarch, found out there is one. After living through
many dramatic changes and losing loved ones along the way, he realized
there had been a constant presence in his life. He prayed, “May the
God . . . who has been my shepherd all my life to this day . . . bless
these boys” (Gen. 48:15–16).

Jacob had been a shepherd, so he compared his relationship to God as
that of a shepherd and his sheep. From the time a sheep is born
through its growth to old age the shepherd cares for it day and night.
He guides it during the day and protects it during the night. David,
also a shepherd, had the same conviction, but he highlighted the
eternal dimension to it when he said, “I will dwell in the house of
the Lord forever” (Ps. 23:6).

Changing teachers is a part of life. But how good it is to know that
we can have a relationship for life. The Shepherd has promised to be
with us every day of our earthly existence (Matt. 28:20). And when
life here ends, we will be closer to Him than ever.
