Love Won’t Stop

Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.
Luke 15:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 15:1–7

After I turned nineteen, and years before I owned a pager or a cell
phone, I moved more than seven hundred miles away from my mom. One
morning, I left early to run errands, forgetting our scheduled call.
Later that night, two policemen came to my door. Mom had been worried
because I’d never missed one of our chats. After calling repeatedly
and getting a busy signal, she reached out to the authorities and
insisted they check on me. One of the police officers turned to me and
said, “It’s a blessing to know love won’t stop looking for you.”

When I picked up the phone to call my mom, I realized I had
accidentally left the receiver off its base. After I apologized, she
said she needed to spread the good news to the family and friends she
had informed that I’d been missing. I hung up thinking she’d
overreacted a bit, though it felt good to be loved that much.

Scripture paints a beautiful picture of God, who is Love, relentlessly
beckoning His wandering children. Like a good shepherd, He cares about
and seeks out every lost sheep, affirming the priceless value of every
beloved child of God (Luke 15:1–7).

Love never stops looking for us. He will pursue us until we’ve
returned to Him. We can pray for others who need to know that
Love—God—never stops looking for them either.

Reflect & Pray

How does it encourage you to know that God continually pursues you in
love? How is He using you to reveal His love to others?

Heavenly Father, thank You for pursuing us with persistence and
providing a safe place when we return to Your loving arms.
