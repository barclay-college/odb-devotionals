The Perfect Father

Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me.
Psalm 27:10

Today's Scripture: Psalm 27

Standing in the crowded store aisle, I struggled to find the perfect
Father’s Day card. Although we had reconciled after years of a
strained connection, I had never felt close to my dad.

The woman next to me groaned and shoved the card she’d been reading
back into the display. “Why can’t they make cards for people who don’t
have good relationships with their fathers, but are trying to do the
right thing?”

She stormed off before I could respond, so I prayed for her. Thanking
God for affirming only He could be a perfect Father, I asked Him to
strengthen my relationship with my dad.

I long for deeper intimacy with my heavenly Father too. I want David’s
confidence in God’s constant presence, power, and protection (Psalm
27:1–6).

When David cried out for help, he expected God’s answers (vv. 7–9).
Though earthly parents could reject, abandon, or neglect their
children, David declared God’s unconditional acceptance (v. 10). He
lived with assurance in the Lord’s goodness (vv. 11–13). Like most of
us, David sometimes struggled, but the Holy Spirit helped him
persevere in trust and dependence on the Lord (v. 14).

We will encounter difficult relationships on this side of eternity.
But even when people fall short, fail us, or hurt us, we’re still
completely loved and protected by the only Perfect Father.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for being a Father we can always count on.

God—the Perfect Father—will never let us down, leave us, or stop
loving us.
