Benefits Of Friendship

Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their
labor. —
Ecclesiastes 4:9

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 4:9-12

Cicero was one of the greatest thinkers of the Roman Empire. He was a
skilled orator, lawyer, politician, linguist, and writer. Still today
he is quoted for his clear prose and practical wisdom.

For instance, of having friends he wrote: “Friendship improves
happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of our joy and the
dividing of our grief.” He understood the double benefits of
friendship along life’s journey.

Nearly a millennium earlier, King Solomon had written about the value
of friends as well. In Ecclesiastes we read, “Two are better than one,
because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, one
will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls,
for he has no one to help him up” (4:9-10). Certainly a life without
friends makes our sojourn lonely and hard to bear.

That famous Roman and that Jewish king were right: Friends are
important. Friends serve as confidants, counselors, and burden-
sharers.

Think about your friends. Have you been neglecting those God has
provided to share your joys and sorrows? If so, seek out one of your
friends for fellowship this week. Remember, “two are better than one,”
because a friend can double our joy and divide our grief.

Reflect & Pray

A friend is “trust,” a friend is “warmth,” A friend is “always there”
To add to every happiness, To lessen every care. —Anon.

Friends are flowers in the garden of life.
