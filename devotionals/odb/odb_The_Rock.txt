The Rock

Jesus Christ Himself [is] the chief cornerstone. —
Ephesians 2:20

Today's Scripture: Matthew 7:24-27; Ephesians 2:18-22

On a trip to Massachusetts, my husband and I visited Plymouth Rock, an
iconic symbol in the United States. It is traditionally thought to be
the place where the Pilgrims, who traveled to America on the Mayflower
in 1620, first set foot. While we enjoyed learning about its
significance, we were surprised and disappointed that it is so small.
We learned that due to erosion and people chipping off pieces, it is
now just one-third its original size.

The Bible refers to Jesus as a Rock (1 Cor. 10:4), who never changes
(Heb. 13:8). He is the solid Rock on which we can build our lives. The
church (the body of believers) is built on a foundation with “Jesus
Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.” In Him all believers are
joined together (Eph. 2:20-22).

Jesus is the solid Rock we can cling to when the storms of life blow
and beat against us (Matt. 7:25). Writer Madeleine L’Engle said: “It’s
a good thing to have all the props pulled out from under us
occasionally. It gives us some sense of what is rock under our feet
and what is sand.”

Plymouth Rock is an interesting mass of minerals with an intriguing
historical significance. But Jesus is a precious cornerstone, and
those who trust in Him will always have a solid Rock to depend upon.
