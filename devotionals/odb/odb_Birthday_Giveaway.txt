Birthday Giveaway

God loves a cheerful giver. —
2 Corinthians 9:7

Today's Scripture: 1 Chronicles 29:1-14

When I reminded my husband that his 39th birthday was just around the
corner, he declared that he didn’t want any presents. Yeah, right, I
thought, and I continued to press him for gift ideas. That’s when he
told me he wanted to give away the money we would have spent on his
birthday.

The Bible calls us to give willingly—not grudgingly or of necessity—to
support God’s work and to help people (2 Cor. 9:7). This kind of
freewill giving often results in joy for the giver. When King David
donated his personal stash of gold and silver to help build the
temple, many Israelite officials followed his example. After they
contributed bronze, iron, gemstones, and precious metal, “the people
rejoiced, for they had offered willingly” (1 Chron. 29:9).

As part of the celebration, David praised God, saying, “Of Your own we
have given You” (v.14). His point was that God owns everything.
Remembering this allows us to give eagerly, because we are just
returning our resources to their rightful owner—God Himself.

The next time you contribute cash, services, or belongings to support
the cause of Christ, examine your attitude. Are you giving freely and
willingly? God loves a cheerful giver.

Lord, You love the cheerful giver, Who with open heart and hand
Blesses freely, as a river That refreshes all the land. —Murray

How we give is more important than how much we give.
