Stranded

The Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy. —
Genesis 39:21

Today's Scripture: Genesis 39:19-23

Traveling by bus from Memphis, Tennessee, to St. Louis, Missouri,
typically takes about 6 hours—unless the bus driver leaves you
stranded at a gas station. This happened to 45 passengers aboard a bus
who waited 8 hours overnight for a replacement driver after the
original driver abandoned them. They must have felt frustrated by the
delay, anxious about the outcome, and impatient for rescue.

Joseph probably shared those feelings when he landed in prison for a
crime he didn’t commit (Gen. 39). Abandoned and forgotten by any human
who might help him, he was stranded. Still, “the Lord was with Joseph
and showed him mercy, and He gave him favor” (v.21). Eventually, the
prison warden promoted Joseph to oversee fellow inmates, and whatever
Joseph did, “the Lord made it prosper” (v.23). But despite God’s
presence and blessing, Joseph remained incarcerated for years.

You may be stranded in a hospital room, a jail cell, a country far
from home, or your own inner prison. No matter where you are, or how
long you’ve been there, God’s mercy and kindness can reach you.
Because He is God Almighty (Ex. 6:3) and present everywhere (Jer.
23:23-24), He can protect, promote, and provide for you when it seems
no one else can help.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, help us to remember Your presence and power even when we are
not where we want to be in life. Remind us to reach for You when no
one else can reach us.

God is present—even when we feel He is absent.
