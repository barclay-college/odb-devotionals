The Low Point

You are my help and my deliverer.
Psalm 40:17

Today's Scripture: Psalm 40

C. S. Lewis and his older brother, Warren (Warnie), endured several
terms at Wynyard, an English boarding school for boys. The headmaster
was a cruel man who made life unbearable for everyone there. Decades
later, Warnie wrote in his understated dry wit, “I am now sixty-four
and a bit, and have never yet been in a situation in which I have not
had the consolation of reflecting that at any rate I was better off
than I was at Wynyard.” Most of us can recall a similar dark and
difficult time in our lives and be grateful that we’re better off now
than we were then.

Psalm 40:1-5 records a low point of David’s life when he cried out to
the Lord who rescued him. God brought him up from “the slimy pit” and
“the mud and mire” and set his feet on a rock (v. 2). “He put a new
song in my mouth,” David says, “a hymn of praise to our God” (v. 3).

But deliverance from depression and despair are seldom one-time
events. Psalm 40 continues with David’s renewed plea for God’s mercy,
lovingkindness, and truth to deliver him from his own sin and the
threats of his enemies (vv. 11-14).

Along with David, we can say at every low point, “I am poor and needy;
may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer” (v. 17).
