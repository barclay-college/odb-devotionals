A Lasting Letter

The grass withers, the flower fades, but the Word of our God stands
forever. —
Isaiah 40:8

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 40:1-8

The family members who founded Hobby Lobby craft stores are born-again
believers. The president, Steve Green, is passionate about the
Scriptures and plans to establish a Bible museum that will display
rare books and manuscripts from around the world. He said, “We are
interested in . . . encouraging people to consider what [the Bible]
has to say. . . . The goal is to create a museum around the story of
the Bible. No book has been persecuted as much or loved as much. Its
incredible story needs to be told.”

The Bible has been preserved through time in remarkable ways, and the
museum will tell that story. The oldest copies we have of the New
Testament are more numerous and closer to the date of the eyewitness
events recorded than any other ancient document from that time. Their
reports on Christ are more reliable than anything we know about
Socrates or Caesar. It should not surprise us that God is behind the
scenes using people and circumstances to pass on His inspired text of
redemption. Isaiah eloquently proclaimed: “The grass withers, the
flower fades, but the Word of our God stands forever” (Isa. 40:8).

As we read the Bible with an open heart, we long to share its message.
It’s God’s lasting letter to all.
