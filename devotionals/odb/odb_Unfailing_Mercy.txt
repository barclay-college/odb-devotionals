Unfailing Mercy

Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His
compassions fail not. . . . Great is Your faithfulness. —
Lamentations 3:22-23

Today's Scripture: Luke 22:54-62

As I strolled through Chicago’s O’Hare airport, something caught my
eye—a hat worn by someone racing through the concourse. What caught my
attention was the message it conveyed in just two words: “Deny
Everything.” I wondered what it meant. Don’t ever admit to guilt? Or
deny yourself the pleasures and luxuries of life? I scratched my head
at the mystery of those two simple words, “Deny Everything.”

One of Jesus’ followers, Simon Peter, did some denying. In a critical
moment, he denied three times that He even knew Jesus! (Luke 22:57,
58,60). His fear-filled act of denial caused him such guilt and
heartache that, broken by his spiritual failure, he could only go out
and weep bitterly (v.62).

But Peter’s denial of Christ, like our own moments of spiritual
denial, could never diminish the compassion of God. The prophet
Jeremiah wrote, “Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed,
because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is
Your faithfulness” (Lam. 3:22-23). We can take heart that even when we
fail, our faithful God comes to us in mercy and compassion that never
fails!

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, for Your new and never- failing mercies. Forgive me
for the times I deny You and fail others, and teach me to run to You
for Your overflowing compassion.

Being imperfect emphasizes our dependence on God’s mercy.
