Celebrate Freedom

The law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of
sin and death.
Romans 8:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 6:15–23

After being kidnapped, held hostage for thirteen days, and released,
New Zealand news cameraman Olaf Wiig, with a broad smile on his face,
announced, “I feel more alive now than I have in my entire life.”

For reasons difficult to understand, being freed is more exhilarating
than being free.

For those who enjoy freedom every day, Olaf’s joy was a good reminder
of how easily we forget how blessed we are. This is also true
spiritually. Those of us who have been Christians for a long time
often forget what it’s like to be held hostage by sin. We can become
complacent and even ungrateful. But then God sends a reminder in the
form of a new believer who gives an exuberant testimony of what God
has done in his or her life, and once again we see the joy that is
ours when we are “free from the law of sin and death” (Rom. 8:2).

If freedom has become boring to you, or if you tend to focus on what
you can’t do, consider this: Not only are you no longer a slave to
sin, but you are freed to be holy and to enjoy eternal life with
Christ Jesus! (6:22).

Celebrate your freedom in Christ by taking the time to thank God for
the things you are able and free to do as His servant.
