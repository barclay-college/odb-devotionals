Don’t Lose Heart

In due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. —
Galatians 6:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 6:1-10

Cooking can become tedious work when I do it three times a day, week
after week. I get tired of peeling, cutting, slicing, mixing, and then
waiting for food to bake, grill, or boil. But eating is never tedious!
It’s actually something we truly enjoy even though we do it day after
day.

Paul used the illustration of sowing and reaping because he knew that
doing good can be tiring (Gal. 6:7-10). He wrote, “Let us not grow
weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not
lose heart” (v.9). It’s difficult to love our enemies, discipline our
children, or pray without ceasing. However, reaping the good we have
sown isn’t tedious! What a joy when we do get to see love conquering
strife, or children following God’s ways, or answers to prayer.

While the cooking process can take hours, my family usually finishes a
meal in 20 minutes or less. But the reaping that Paul talks about will
be eternal. As we have the opportunity, let’s do what is good and wait
for the blessings in God’s timing. Don’t lose heart today as you go
about following God’s ways. Remember that joy is guaranteed for more
than a lifetime.
