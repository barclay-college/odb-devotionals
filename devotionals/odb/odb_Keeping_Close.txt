Keeping Close

Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
Deuteronomy 6:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 6:1–9

My mile-long walk home from dropping off my daughter at her school
gives me the opportunity to memorize some verses from the Bible—if I’m
intentional about doing so. When I take those minutes to turn over
God’s Word in my mind, I often find them coming back to me later in
the day, bringing me comfort and wisdom.

When Moses prepared the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, he
urged them to hold close to God’s commands and decrees (Deuteronomy
6:1–2). Wanting them to flourish, he said they should turn these
instructions over in their minds and discuss them with their children
(vv. 6–7). He even said to tie them to their wrists and bind them to
their foreheads (v. 8). He didn’t want them to forget God’s
instructions to live as people who honored the Lord and enjoyed His
blessings.

How might you consider God’s words today? One idea is to write out a
verse from Scripture, and every time you wash your hands or take a
drink, read the words and turn them over in your mind. Or before you
go to sleep, consider a short passage from the Bible as the last act
of the day. Many are the ways of keeping God’s Word close to our
hearts!
