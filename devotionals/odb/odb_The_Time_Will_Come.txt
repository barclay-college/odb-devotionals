The Time Will Come

The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine. —
2 Timothy 4:3

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 4:1-8

A USA Today article describes how parents today seek to initiate their
children into a world of all faiths. Ema Drouillard, who runs a
ceremony service, was asked by a couple to conduct a service for their
baby, Greer. The mother said, “We just wanted a larger spirit to guide
our daughter, but we didn’t want to get specific. I wanted all her
bases covered.” The couple said, “We just do Christianity L-I-T-E” for
Greer, who “believes in angels and fairies, leprechauns and Santa
Claus.” This illustrates the low value placed on scriptural truth that
is so prevalent in our culture today.

The apostle Paul warned Timothy that a time would come when people
would prefer “lite” spiritual meals and would not tolerate substantive
teaching (2 Tim. 4:3-4). He predicted that false teaching would
increase and be embraced by many because it caters to the needs of
their flesh. They have a craving to be entertained and desire teaching
that leaves them with good feelings about themselves. Paul instructed
Timothy to combat this by teaching doctrines according to God’s Word.
The purpose of his instruction was to correct, rebuke, and encourage
others (v.2).

As believers we are called to teach and obey the Word of God, not to
scratch the itches of our culture.
