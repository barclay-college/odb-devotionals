Hoo-ah!

Blessed be the Lord, who daily loads us with benefits, the God of our
salvation! Selah.
Psalm 68:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 68:7–10,19–20

The US Army’s expression “hoo-ah” is a guttural response barked when
troops voice approval. Its original meaning is lost to history, but
some say it is derived from an old acronym HUA—Heard, Understood, and
Acknowledged. I first heard the word in basic training.

Many years later it found its way into my vocabulary again when I
began to meet on Wednesday mornings with a group of men to study the
Scriptures. One morning one of the men—a former member of the 82nd
Airborne Division—was reading one of the psalms and came to the
notation selah that occurs throughout the psalms. Instead of reading
“selah,” however, he growled hoo–ah, and that became our word for
selah ever after.

No one knows for certain what selah actually means. Some say it is
only a musical notation. It often appears after a truth that calls for
a deep-seated, emotional response. In that sense hoo–ah works for me.

This morning I read Psalm 68:19: “Blessed be the Lord, who daily [day
to day] loads us with benefits, the God of our salvation! Selah”
(nkjv).

Imagine that! Every single morning God loads us up on His shoulders
and carries us through the day. He is our salvation. Thus safe and
secure in Him, we’ve no cause for worry or for fear. “Hoo-ah!” I say.
