Deadly Sins

You now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will
rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you. —
John 16:22

Today's Scripture: John 16:17-24

You may be familiar with the list of seven deadly sins that was
formulated during the sixth century: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth,
vengeance, envy, and pride. But you may not know that the original
list compiled during the fourth century also included the sin of
sadness. Over the years, that emotion was omitted from the inventory.

Some people are blessed with a cheerful disposition. They always seem
to be happy. They wear a perpetual smile almost as if they were
advertising toothpaste. But then there are others who seem to be
chronically sad. They continually complain about life and its burdens.
And who can deny that afflictions are discouraging?

While we acknowledge that not everybody is blessed with a bright
outlook on life, we need to remember that joy is one of the gifts
Jesus promised to His followers. And we need to resist any tendency to
let sadness dominate our emotional lives.

Jesus promised His disciples on the night Judas betrayed Him, “Your
joy no one will take from you” (John 16:22). Remember that joy is the
fruit of the indwelling Holy Spirit (Gal. 5:22). Let’s ask the Lord to
help us look beyond our sorrowful circumstances and encourage our
hearts by the vision of joy that awaits us (Heb. 12:2).

Reflect & Pray

You alone, Lord Jesus, can true joy impart, For You know the sorrow of
the human heart; You came here from glory many hearts to win And in
love for sinners suffered once for sin. —Anon.

Joy is a fruit of the Spirit that’s always in season.
