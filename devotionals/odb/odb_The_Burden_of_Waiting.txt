The Burden of Waiting

Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
Psalm 90:12

Today's Scripture: Psalm 90

Over the last few years, two members of my family have faced life-
threatening diagnoses. For me, the hardest part of supporting them
through their treatments has been the constant uncertainty. I am
always desperate for a definitive word from a doctor, but things are
rarely that straightforward. Instead of being given clarity, we are
often asked to wait.

It’s hard to bear the burden of uncertainty, always wondering what the
next test will reveal. Will we have weeks, months, years, or decades
before death separates us? But regardless of disease and diagnosis,
each of us will die one day—things like cancer just bring our
mortality to the forefront instead of letting it hide in the recesses
of our minds.

Faced with sobering reminders of our mortality, I find myself praying
words that Moses once prayed. Psalm 90 tells us that though our lives
are like grass that withers and fades (vv. 5–6), we have an eternal
home with God (v. 1). Like Moses, we can ask God to teach us to number
our days so we can make wise decisions (v. 12), and to make our brief
lives fruitful by making what we do for Him count (v. 17). Ultimately,
the psalm reminds us that our hope is not in a doctor’s diagnosis, but
in a God who is “from everlasting to everlasting.”
