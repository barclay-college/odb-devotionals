Perfect Fit

[Christ], in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows
into a holy temple in the Lord. —
Ephesians 2:21

Today's Scripture: Exodus 26:1-11

Too long. Too short. Too big. Too small. Too tight. Too loose. These
words describe most of the clothes I try on. Finding the perfect fit
seems impossible.

Finding a church that is a “perfect fit” poses similar problems. Every
church has something that’s not quite right. Our gifts aren’t
recognized. Our talents aren’t appreciated. Our sense of humor is
misunderstood. Certain attitudes, beliefs, people, or programs make us
uncomfortable. We feel as if we don’t fit. We struggle to find our
place.

We know, however, that God wants us to fit together with one another.
The apostle Paul said we are being “built together to become a
dwelling in which God lives” (Eph. 2:22 NIV).

The believers in the church today, like the tabernacle in the days of
Moses (Ex. 26) and the temple in the days of Solomon (1 Kings 6:1-14),
are the dwelling place of God on earth. God wants us to fit
together—for there to be no divisions in His church. This means that
we, the building blocks, are to be “perfectly joined together in the
same mind and in the same judgment” (1 Cor. 1:10).

No church will be a perfect fit, but we can all work at fitting
together more perfectly.
