A New Creation

If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come.
2 Corinthians 5:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 9:10-22

Early in my work life I had a coworker who seemed to delight in using
God’s name as a profanity. He mercilessly taunted Christians who were
new to their faith or who tried to talk with him about Jesus. On the
day I left that job to move to another community and a new place of
employment, I remember thinking that this man would never become a
follower of Jesus.

Two years later I visited my old workplace. He was still there, but
never have I witnessed such a dramatic change in a person! This man,
so antagonistic to faith, was now a walking, talking example of what
it means to be a “new creation” in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). And now, more
than 30 years later, he’s still telling others how Jesus “met him
where he was—sin and all.”

It occurs to me that the early Christians must have seen something
similar in Paul, their fiery persecutor—a riveting example of what it
means to become a new creation (Acts 9:1-22). What great hope both of
these lives are to those who think themselves beyond redemption!

Jesus sought Paul and my former coworker—and me. And He continues
today to reach the “unreachable” and model for us just how we can
reach people too.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I want to learn to reach out to others and share Your love and
forgiveness. Teach me and help me to step out in both faith and trust.
