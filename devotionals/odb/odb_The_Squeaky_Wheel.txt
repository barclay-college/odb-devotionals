The Squeaky Wheel

The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. —
James 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 18:1-8

“The squeaky wheel gets the oil” is a popular proverb. As a child I
rode my bicycle for long distances between home and school, and the
squeaky sounds of the wheels drew my attention to the need to
lubricate them.

In Luke 18, the widow’s persistent request to the judge for justice
against her adversary made her sound like a “squeaky wheel” until she
got the result she needed. Luke explains that Jesus told this story to
teach us the need to pray continually and not to give up, even if it
appears that the answer to our prayer is delayed (vv.1-5).

God is certainly not an unjust judge who must be harassed before He
responds to us. He is our loving Father who cares about us and hears
us when we cry to Him. Regular, persistent prayer draws us closer to
Him. It may feel like we are a squeaky wheel, but the Lord welcomes
our prayer and encourages us to approach Him with our cries. He hears
us and will come to our aid in ways that we may not expect.

As Jesus teaches in Matthew 6:5-8, constant prayer does not require
long periods of “vain repetitions.” Rather, as we bring our needs
before God “day and night” (Luke 18:7) and walk with the One who
already knows our needs, we learn to trust God and wait patiently for
His response.
