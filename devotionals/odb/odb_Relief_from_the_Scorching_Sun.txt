Relief from the Scorching Sun

The Lord is your shade at your right hand.
Psalm 121:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 121

Living in Britain, I don’t usually worry about sunburn. After all, the
sun is often blocked by a thick cover of clouds. But recently I spent
some time in Spain, and I quickly realized that with my pale skin, I
could only be out in the sunshine for ten minutes before I needed to
scurry back under the umbrella.

As I considered the scorching nature of the Mediterranean sun, I began
to understand more deeply the meaning of the image of the Lord God as
His people’s shade at their right hand. Residents of the Middle East
knew unrelenting heat, and they needed to find shelter from the sun’s
burning rays.

The psalmist uses this picture of the Lord as shade in Psalm 121,
which can be understood as a conversation on a heart level—a dialogue
with oneself about the Lord’s goodness and faithfulness. When we use
this psalm in prayer, we reassure ourselves that the Lord will never
leave us, for He forms a protective covering over us. And just as we
take shelter from the sun underneath umbrellas, so too can we find a
safe place in the Lord.

We lift our eyes to the “Maker of heaven and earth” (vv. 1–2) because
whether we are in times of sunshine or times of rain, we receive His
gifts of protection, relief, and refreshment.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, You protect me. Shield me from anything that would
take my focus away from You.

We find refuge in the Lord.
