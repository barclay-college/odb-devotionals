Do It Now!

Exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you
be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. —
Hebrews 3:13

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 3:7-15

Several years ago a friend took me to a motivational seminar that I
thoroughly enjoyed. Instead of focusing on money and success, the
leaders guided us toward understanding our unique identity and purpose
in life. Then they passed along some helpful methods for effective
living. One motto has stayed with me: “Do it now!” The principle they
taught us was that it takes as much energy to avoid a task as it does
to do it. Procrastination saps power; completion gives relief.

A spiritual application can be seen in Hebrews 3, a passage filled
with an air of immediacy as it calls us to obey the Lord. “‘Today,’ if
you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the
rebellion, . . . but exhort one another daily, while it is called
‘Today,’ lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin”
(vv.7-8,13). We don’t know how long it would have taken the children
of Israel to reach the Promised Land if they had obeyed God, but their
40-year journey resulted from their unwilling hearts. An entire
generation missed the adventure of a lifetime (vv.8-11).

When we know how the Lord wants us to live, why don’t we just say
“Yes!” No debate, no delay. Do it now!

Reflect & Pray

It’s easy to procrastinate And leave good deeds undone, But such a
course will bring regrets When life’s short race is run. —Anon.

Do it now! Today will be yesterday tomorrow.
