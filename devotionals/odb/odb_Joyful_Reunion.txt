Joyful Reunion

He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming quickly.”
Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus! —
Revelation 22:20

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 4:1-8

Some years ago when our children were still small, I flew home after a
10-day ministry trip. In those days people were allowed to visit the
airport boarding area to greet incoming passengers. When my flight
landed, I came out of the jet-bridge and was greeted by our little
ones—so happy to see me that they were screaming and crying. I looked
at my wife, whose eyes were teary. I couldn’t speak. Strangers in the
gate area also teared up as our children hugged my legs and cried
their greetings. It was a wonderful moment.

The memory of the intensity of that greeting serves as a gentle rebuke
to the priorities of my own heart. The apostle John, eagerly desiring
Jesus’ return, wrote, “He who testifies to these things says, ‘Surely
I am coming quickly.’ Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!” (Rev. 22:20).
In another passage, Paul even spoke of a crown awaiting those who have
“loved His appearing” (2 Tim. 4:8). Yet sometimes I don’t feel as
eager for Christ’s return as my children were for mine.

Jesus is worthy of the very best of our love and devotion—and nothing
on earth should compare to the thought of seeing Him face-to-face. May
our love for our Savior deepen as we anticipate our joyful reunion
with Him.
