Columbus’ Eclipse

We are not, as so many, peddling the Word of God. —
2 Corinthians 2:17

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 2:14-17

On one of Christopher Columbus’ voyages, he found that his crew’s food
supply was almost depleted. Anchored off the island of Jamaica, he was
grateful to be given food by the islanders. But as time went on, the
gifts of food decreased so that the crew began to starve.

Columbus knew from an astronomy book that a lunar eclipse would soon
occur. He called the native chiefs together and told them God was
angry about their selfishness and would blot out the moon. At first
the islanders scoffed. But when they watched the night’s silver disc
slowly become dark, they became terrified and quickly brought food.
Columbus said that if he prayed, the moon would be restored. Though we
may empathize with his circumstances, Columbus’ “message from God” was
dishonest and self-serving.

Aware of religious charlatans who “peddled” God’s Word for their own
desires, the apostle Paul wrote, “We are not, as so many, peddling the
Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the
sight of God” (2 Cor. 2:17).

At all times we must be on guard not to misrepresent God’s message to
acquire what we want from others. With a heart yielded to God, we must
honestly share spiritual truths that will benefit those who hear.

Reflect & Pray

Don’t compromise the Word of God Or twist what He has said; For
blessing comes from faithfully Proclaiming truth instead. —Sper

The purpose of sharing God’s truth is to profit others, not to prosper
ourselves.
