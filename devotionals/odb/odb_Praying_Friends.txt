Praying Friends

Brethren, pray for us. —
1 Thessalonians 5:25

Today's Scripture: 1 Thessalonians 3:6-13

I met my friend Angie for lunch after having not seen her for several
months. At the end of our time together, she pulled out a piece of
paper with notes from our previous get-together. It was a list of my
prayer requests she had been praying for since then. She went through
each one and asked if God had answered yet or if there were any
updates. And then we talked about her prayer requests. How encouraging
to have a praying friend!

The apostle Paul had a praying relationship with the churches he
served, including the one at Thessalonica. He thanked God for the
faith, love, and hope of the people (1 Thess. 1:2-3). He longed to see
them, and asked God “night and day” that he might be able to visit
them again (3:10-11). He requested that the Lord would help them
“increase and abound in love to one another and to all” (v.12). He
also prayed that their hearts would be blameless before God (v.13).
They must have been encouraged as they read about Paul’s concern and
prayers for them. Paul knew too his own need for God’s presence and
power and pleaded, “Brethren, pray for us” (5:25).

Loving Father, thank You for wanting us to talk with You. Teach us all
to be praying friends.
