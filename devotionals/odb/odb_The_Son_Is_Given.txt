The Son Is Given

For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given. —
Isaiah 9:6

Today's Scripture: Luke 1:26-33

One of my favorite portions of Handel’s Messiah is the joyous movement
“For unto us a Child is born,” from the first part of the oratorio. I
especially love how the chorus rises to the phrase, “Unto us a Son is
given.” Those words, of course, are taken from Isaiah 9:6, “For unto
us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given.” Handel’s majestic music
soars with adoration for the Son who came to us in human flesh that
first Christmas.

The New Testament clarifies even further who this Son is. In Luke 1,
the angelic messenger appeared to Mary and identified the Christ-child
in four ways. He would be the son of Mary, making Him fully human
(1:31). He would be the Son of the Highest, which made Him fully
divine (1:32). He would also be the Son of David, giving Him royal
lineage (1:32). And He would bear the title of Son of God (1:35),
giving Him equality with the Father in all things. All of the roles
the Messiah was called to fill are made possible in these distinct
expressions of His Sonship.

As we worship Him this Christmas, may our celebrations be filled with
joy and wonder at the fullness of what it means. Our heavenly Father
has given us His perfect, sufficient Son. O come, let us adore Him!
