Courage to Be Faithful

Do not be frightened.
1 Peter 3:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 3:13–18

Fear is Hadassah’s constant companion. Hadassah, a young Jewish girl
living in the first century, is a fictional character in Francine
Rivers’ book A Voice in the Wind. After Hadassah becomes a slave in a
Roman household, she fears persecution for her faith in Christ. She
knows that Christians are despised, and many are sent to their
execution or thrown to the lions in the arena. Will she have the
courage to stand for the truth when she is tested?

When her worst fear becomes reality, her mistress and other Roman
officials who hate Christianity confront her. She has two choices:
recant her faith in Christ or be taken to the arena. Then, as she
proclaims Jesus as the Christ, her fear falls away and she becomes
bold even in the face of death.

The Bible reminds us that sometimes we will suffer for doing what is
right—whether for sharing the gospel or for living godly lives that
are against today’s values. We are told not to be frightened (1 Peter
3:14), but to “revere Christ as Lord” in our hearts (v. 15).
Hadassah’s main battle took place in her heart. When she finally made
up her mind to choose Jesus, she found the courage to be faithful.

When we make the decision to honor Christ, He will help us to be bold
and to overcome our fears in the midst of opposition.

Father, give me boldness to stand firm in difficult times.

Let us be bold as we witness for God.
