Tears of a Teen

I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart. —
Romans 9:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 9:1-5

As I sat with four teenagers and a 20-something homeless man at a soup
kitchen in Alaska, I was touched by the teens’ compassion for him.
They listened as he talked about what he believed and then they gently
presented the gospel to him—lovingly offering him hope in Jesus.
Sadly, the man refused to seriously consider the gospel.

As we were leaving, one of the girls, Grace, expressed through her
tears how much she didn’t want the man to die without knowing Jesus.
From the heart, she grieved for this young man who, at least at this
point, was rejecting the love of the Savior.

The tears of this teen remind me of the apostle Paul who served the
Lord humbly and had great sorrow in his heart for his countrymen,
desiring that they trust in Christ (Rom. 9:1-5). Paul’s compassion and
concern must have brought him to tears on many occasions.

If we care enough for others who have not yet accepted God’s gift of
forgiveness through Christ, we will find ways to share with them. With
the confidence of our own faith and with tears of compassion, let’s
take the good news to those who need to know the Savior.

Reflect & Pray

Is there someone you need to talk to about Jesus today?

Sharing the gospel is one person telling another good news.
