At Home With Jesus

I go and prepare a place for you.
John 14:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:1–4

“There’s no place like home.” The phrase reflects a deeply rooted
yearning within us to have a place to rest, be, and belong. Jesus
addressed this desire for rootedness when, after He and His friends
had their last supper together, He spoke about His impending death and
resurrection. He promised that although He would go away, He would
come back for them. And He would prepare a room for them. A dwelling-
place. A home.

He made this place for them—and us—through fulfilling the requirements
of God’s law when He died on the cross as the sinless man. He assured
His disciples that if He went to the trouble of creating this home,
that of course He would come back for them and not leave them alone.
They didn’t need to fear or be worried about their lives, whether on
earth or in heaven.

We can take comfort and assurance from Jesus’s words, for we believe
and trust that He makes a home for us; that He makes His home within
us (see John 14:23); and that He has gone ahead of us to prepare our
heavenly home. Whatever sort of physical place we live in, we belong
with Jesus, upheld by His love and surrounded in His peace. With Him,
there’s no place like home.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus Christ, if and when we feel homeless, remind us that You
are our home. May we share this sense of belonging with those we meet.

Jesus prepares a place for us to live forever.
