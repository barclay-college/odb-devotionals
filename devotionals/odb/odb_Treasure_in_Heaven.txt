Treasure in Heaven

For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
Matthew 6:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:19–21

When I was growing up, my two sisters and I liked to sit side-by-side
on top of my mother’s large cedar-lined chest. My mom kept our wool
sweaters in it and handiwork that was embroidered or crocheted by my
grandmother. She valued the contents of the chest and relied on the
pungent odor of the cedar wood to discourage moths from destroying
what was inside.

Most earthly possessions can easily be destroyed by insects or rust,
or can even be stolen. Matthew 6 encourages us to place a special
focus—not on things that have a limited lifespan but on those that
have eternal value. When my mom died at fifty-seven, she had not
accumulated a lot of earthly possessions, but I like to think about
the treasure she stored up in heaven (vv. 19–20).

I recall how much she loved God and served Him in quiet ways: caring
faithfully for her family, teaching children in Sunday school,
befriending a woman abandoned by her husband, comforting a young
mother who had lost her baby. And she prayed. . . . Even after she
lost her sight and became confined to a wheelchair, she continued to
love and pray for others.

Our real treasure isn’t measured in what we accumulate—but in what or
whom we invest our time and our passions. What “treasures” are we
storing up in heaven by serving and following Jesus?

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, help me to choose to invest my life in things that are
eternal.

Our real wealth is what we invest for eternity.
