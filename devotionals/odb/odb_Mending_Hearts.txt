Mending Hearts

You are the light of the world.
Matthew 5:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 5:1–16

Not long ago I went to a seamstress to have some clothing altered. As
I entered her shop I was encouraged by what I saw on the walls. One
sign read, “We can mend your clothes but only God can mend your
heart.” Near it was a painting of Mary Magdalene weeping in anguish as
the risen Christ was about to reveal Himself to her. Another sign
asked, “Need prayer? Let us pray with you.”

The owner told me that she had run this small business for
fifteen years. “We’ve been surprised how the Lord has worked here
through the statements of faith we have posted in different places. A
while back someone trusted Christ as their Savior right here. It is
amazing to watch God work.” I told her I too was a Christian and
commended her for telling others about Christ in her workplace.

Not all of us are able to be so bold in our workplace, but we can find
many creative and practical ways of showing others unexpected love,
patience, and kindness wherever we are. Since leaving that shop, I’ve
been thinking about how many ways there are to live out our Lord’s
statement: “You are the light of the world” (Matt. 5:14).
