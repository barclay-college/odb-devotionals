Losing Our Way

The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have
strayed from the faith in their greediness. —
1 Timothy 6:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Timothy 6:6-10

An online survey conducted by a New York law firm reveals that 52
percent of Wall Street traders, brokers, investment bankers, and other
financial service professionals have either engaged in illegal
activity or believe they may need to do so in order to be successful.
The survey concludes that these financial leaders “have lost their
moral compass” and “accept corporate wrongdoing as a necessary evil.”

In mentoring young Timothy, the apostle Paul warned that the love of
money and the desire to get rich had caused some to lose their way.
They had yielded to temptations and embraced many “foolish and
harmful” desires (1 Tim. 6:9). Paul saw “the love of money” (not money
itself) as a source of “all kinds of evil” (v.10), especially the evil
of trusting in money rather than depending on Christ.

As we learn to see that Christ is the source of all we have, we will
find contentment in Him rather than in material possessions. When we
seek godliness rather than riches, we will gain a desire to be
faithful with what we have been given.

Let’s deliberately cultivate an attitude of contentment in God, and
faithfully submit to Him, for our Provider will care for us.

Reflect & Pray

Father, it’s easy to see the problem that others have with loving
money. But I know I have my own struggles too. I need Your help to
learn thankfulness for all that You have given. Grow in me an attitude
of contentment in You.

To love money is to lose sight of the Source of life.
