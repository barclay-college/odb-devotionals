Strength for the Weary

Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.
Isaiah 40:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 40:27–31

On a beautiful, sunny day, I was walking in a park and feeling very
weary in spirit. It wasn’t just one thing weighing me down—it seemed
to be everything. When I stopped to sit on a bench, I noticed a small
plaque placed there in loving memory of a “devoted husband, father,
brother, and friend.” Also on the plaque were these words, “But they
who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up
with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary, they shall
walk and not faint” (Isa. 40:31 esv).

Those familiar words came to me as a personal touch from the Lord.
Weariness—whether physical, emotional, or spiritual—comes to us all.
Isaiah reminds us that although we become tired, the Lord, the
everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth “will not grow
tired or weary” (v. 28). How easily I had forgotten that in every
situation “[the Lord] gives strength to the weary and increases the
power of the weak” (v. 29).

What’s it like on your journey today? If fatigue has caused you to
forget God’s presence and power, why not pause and recall His promise.
“Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength” (v. 31). Here.
Now. Right where we are.
