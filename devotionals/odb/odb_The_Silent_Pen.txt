The Silent Pen

The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. —
James 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 3:1-12

Former US President Harry Truman had a rule: Any letters written in
anger had to sit on his desk for 24 hours before they could be mailed.
If at the end of that “cooling off” period, he still felt the same
sentiments, he would send the letter. By the end of his life, Truman’s
unmailed letters filled a large desk drawer.

How often in this age of immediate communication would even 24 minutes
of wise restraint spare us embarrassment! In his epistle, James
addressed a universal theme in human history when he wrote about the
damage an uncontrolled tongue can bring. “No man can tame the tongue,”
he wrote. “It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison” (3:8).

When we’re gossiping or speaking in anger, we find ourselves outside
the lines of what God desires. Our tongues, our pens, and even our
keyboards should more often fall silent with thanks in our hearts for
the restraint God provides. All too often, when we speak we remind
everyone of our brokenness as human beings.

When we want to surprise others with the difference Christ makes, we
may need to look no further than restraining our tongue. Others can’t
help but notice when we honor God with what we say—or don’t say.

Reflect & Pray

Help me, Lord, to use my words not to tear down others or build up my
own reputation, but to seek the good of others first, and in so doing
to serve You and Your kingdom.

Whoever guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
—Proverbs 21:23
