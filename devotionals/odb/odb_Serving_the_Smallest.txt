Serving the Smallest

God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things.
1 Corinthians 1:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 14:15–23

The video showed a man kneeling beside a busy freeway during an out-
of-control brush fire. He was clapping his hands and pleading with
something to come. What was it? A dog? Moments later a bunny hopped
into the picture. The man scooped up the scared rabbit and sprinted to
safety.

How did the rescue of such a small thing make national news? That’s
why. There’s something endearing about compassion shown to the least
of these. It takes a big heart to make room for the smallest creature.

Jesus said the kingdom of God is like a man who gave a banquet and
made room for everyone who was willing to come. Not just the movers
and shakers but also “the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame”
(Luke 14:21). I’m thankful that God targets the weak and the seemingly
insignificant, because otherwise I’d have no shot. Paul said, “God
chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the
lowly things of this world and the despised things . . . so that no
one may boast before him” (1 Corinthians 1:27–29).

How big must God’s heart be to save a small person like me! In
response, how large has my heart grown to be? I can easily tell, not
by how I please the “important people,” but by how I serve the ones
society might deem the least important.

Reflect & Pray

What types of people do you have a hard time valuing? In what
ways might God want you to change that?

God, as Your servants please help us to value others the way You do,
regardless of who they are or what they do.
