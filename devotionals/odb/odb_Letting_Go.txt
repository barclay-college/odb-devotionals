Letting Go

The Lord had said to Abram, “Go . . . to the land I will show you.”
Genesis 12:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 12:1–9

For our wedding anniversary, my husband borrowed a tandem bike so we
could enjoy a romantic adventure together. As we began to pedal on our
way, I quickly realized that as the rider on the back my vision of the
road ahead was eclipsed by my husband’s broad shoulders. Also, my
handlebars were fixed; they didn’t affect the steering of our bike.
Only the front handlebars determined our direction; mine served merely
as support for my upper body. I had the choice to either be frustrated
by my lack of control or to embrace the journey and trust Mike would
guide us safely on our route.

When God asked Abram to leave his homeland and family, He didn’t offer
much information concerning the destination. No geographic
coordinates. No description of the new land or its natural resources.
Not even an indication of how long it would take to get there. God
simply gave the instruction to “go” to the land He would show him.
Abram’s obedience to God’s instruction, despite lacking the details
most humans crave, is credited to him as faith (Heb. 11:8).

If we find ourselves grappling with uncertainty or a lack of control
in our lives, let’s seek to adopt Abram’s example of following and
trusting God. The Lord will steer us well.
