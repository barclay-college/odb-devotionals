An Honest Heart

I know also, my God, that You test the heart and have pleasure in
uprightness. —
1 Chronicles 29:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 15

I came across an epitaph on an old gravestone in a cemetery the other
day. It read, “J. Holgate: An honest man.”

I know nothing of Holgate’s life, but because his marker is unusually
ornate, he must have struck it rich. But whatever he accomplished in
his lifetime, he’s remembered for just one thing: He was “an honest
man.”

Diogenes, the Greek philosopher, spent a lifetime in search of honesty
and finally concluded that an honest man could not be found. Honest
people are hard to find in any age, but the trait is one that greatly
matters. Honesty is not the best policy; it’s the only policy, and one
of the marks of a man or woman who lives in God’s presence. David
writes, “Lord, . . . who may dwell in Your holy hill? He who walks
uprightly” (Ps. 15:1-2).

I ask myself: Am I trustworthy and honorable in all my affairs? Do my
words ring true? Do I speak the truth in love or do I fudge and fade
the facts now and then, or exaggerate for emphasis? If so, I may turn
to God with complete confidence and ask for forgiveness and for a good
and honest heart—to make truthfulness an integral part of my nature.
The One who has begun a good work in me is faithful. He will do it.
