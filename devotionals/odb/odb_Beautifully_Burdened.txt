Beautifully Burdened

My yoke is easy and my burden is light.
Matthew 11:30

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 11:28–30

I awoke to pitch darkness. I hadn’t slept more than thirty minutes and
my heart sensed that sleep wouldn’t return soon. A friend’s husband
lay in the hospital, having received the dreaded news, “The cancer is
back—in the brain and spine now.” My whole being hurt for my friends.
What a heavy load! And yet, somehow my spirit was lifted through my
sacred vigil of prayer. You might say I felt beautifully burdened for
them. How could this be?

In Matthew 11:28–30, Jesus promises rest for our weary souls.
Strangely, His rest comes as we bend under His yoke and embrace His
burden. He clarifies in verse 30, “For my yoke is easy and my burden
is light.” When we allow Jesus to lift our burden from our backs and
then tether ourselves to Jesus’s yoke, we become harnessed with Him,
in step with Him and all He allows. When we bend under His burden, we
share in His sufferings, which ultimately allows us to share in His
comfort as well (2 Corinthians 1:5).

My concern for my friends was a heavy burden. Yet I felt grateful that
God would allow me to carry them in prayer. Gradually I ebbed back to
sleep and awoke—still beautifully burdened but now under the easy yoke
and light load of walking with Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

What are you carrying today? How will you give that burden to Jesus?

Dear Jesus, please take my heavy load and lay upon me Your beautiful
burden for this world.
