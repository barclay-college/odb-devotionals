The Drummer Boy

She out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.
Luke 21:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 21:1-4

“The Little Drummer Boy” is a popular Christmas song written in 1941.
It was originally known as “Carol of the Drum” and is based on a
traditional Czech carol. Although there isn’t any reference to a
drummer boy in the Christmas story in Matthew 1–2 and Luke 2, the
point of the carol goes straight to the heart of the meaning of
worship. The carol describes how a boy is summoned by the Magi to the
scene of Christ’s birth. Unlike the wise men, however, the drummer has
no gift—so he gives what he has. He plays his drum, saying, “I played
my best for Him.”

This echoes the worship Jesus described when He told of the widow and
her two coins: “ ‘Truly I tell you,’ he said, ‘this poor widow has put
in more than all the others. All these people gave their gifts out of
their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live
on’ ” (Luke 21:3-4).

All the drummer boy had was his drum and all the poor widow had were
her two coins, but the God they worshiped was worthy of their all. He
is worthy of our all as well, having given His all for us.
