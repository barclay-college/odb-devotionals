Answer The Cry

[The Lord] will be very gracious to you at the sound of your cry. —
Isaiah 30:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 30:15-22

When my grandchildren were young, my son took them to see the stage
production of The Lion King. As the young lion, Simba, stood over his
father, King Mufasa, who had been killed by his evil uncle, little
Simba, afraid and alone, cried out, “Help, Help, Help!” At that
moment, my 3-year-old grandson stood on his chair in the hushed
theater and shouted, “Why doesn’t somebody help him?!”

The Old Testament contains many accounts of God’s people crying out
for help. Although their trouble was often self-imposed due to their
waywardness, God was still eager to come to their aid.

The prophet Isaiah had to deliver a lot of bad news, but in the midst
of it he assured the people that “the Lord longs to be gracious to
you; therefore he will rise up to show you compassion. . . . How
gracious he will be when you cry for help!” (Isa. 30:18-19 niv). Yet
God often looked to His own people to be the answer to that cry for
help (see Isa. 58:10).

Today, people all around us are in need of someone to take action to
help them. It is a high privilege to become the hands of God as we
respond on His behalf to cries for help.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, remind me that You desire to show compassion to those in need
and that You often call on us to be the instruments of that
compassion. Give me an opportunity today to show Your love to at least
one person in need.

Show that God cares by lending a helping hand.
