Joining The Family

You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. —
Galatians 3:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 3:26–4:7

Maurice Griffin was adopted when he was 32 years old. He had lived
with Lisa and Charles Godbold 20 years earlier as a foster child.
Although Maurice was now a man living on his own, adoption had been
what the family and he had always longed for. Once they were reunited
and the adoption was official, Maurice commented, “This is probably
the happiest moment in my life. . . . I’m happy to be home.”

Those of us who have joined the family of God may refer to that time
as the happiest moment in our lives. When we trust Christ for
salvation, we become God’s children, and He becomes our heavenly
Father. The Bible assures us, “You are all sons of God through faith
in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:26).

As God’s adopted children, we acquire spiritual siblings—our brothers
and sisters in Christ—and we all share an eternal inheritance (Col.
1:12). In addition, Jesus’ Spirit indwells our hearts and enables us
to pray using the name Abba, Father (Gal. 4:6)—like a child calling,
“Daddy.”

To be a child of God is to experience the closeness and security of a
Father who loves us, accepts us, and wants to know us. Our adoption
into His family is a wonderful homecoming.

Reflect & Pray

I once was an outcast stranger on earth, A sinner by choice, and an
alien by birth; But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down, An heir
to the mansion, a robe, and a crown. —Buell

God’s arms are always open to welcome anyone home.
