More And More

May the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and
to all, just as we do to you. —
1 Thessalonians 3:12

Today's Scripture: 1 Thessalonians 3:12–4:10

A rallying cry often heard today in our economically challenged world
is “Less and less.” Governments are called to balance their budgets.
People are urged to use less energy and decrease consumption of
limited resources. It is good advice that we should all heed. In the
realm of faith, however, there are no shortages of love and grace and
strength. Therefore, as followers of Christ, we are urged to
demonstrate His love in our lives in ever-increasing measure.

In the apostle Paul’s first letter to the believers in Thessalonica,
he urged them to “abound more and more” in a lifestyle that pleases
God (4:1). He also commended them for their demonstration of love for
each other, and called them to “increase more and more” in brotherly
love (v.10).

That kind of ever-increasing love is possible only because it comes
from God’s limitless resources, not from our own dwindling supply.
Poet Annie Johnson Flint wrote:

His love has no limit, His grace has no measure, His power has no
boundary known unto men; For out of His infinite riches in Jesus, He
giveth, and giveth, and giveth again. (© Renewal 1969, Lillenas
Publishing)

The apostle Paul expressed his desire for the believers: “May the Lord
make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just
as we do to you” (1 Thess. 3:12).

How much should we love God and others? More and more!
