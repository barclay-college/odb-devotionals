You Have Purpose

If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so
that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ.
1 Peter 4:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 4:7–11

On a hot day in western Texas, my niece Vania saw a woman standing by
a stoplight and holding up a sign. As she drove closer, she tried to
read what the sign said, assuming it was a request for food or money.
Instead, she was surprised to see these three words:

“You Have Purpose”

God has created each of us for a specific purpose. Primarily that
purpose is to bring honor to Him, and one way we do that is by meeting
the needs of others (1 Peter 4:10–11).

A mother of young children may find purpose in wiping runny noses and
telling her kids about Jesus. An employee in an unsatisfying job might
find his purpose in doing his work conscientiously, remembering it is
the Lord he is serving (Col. 3:23–24). A woman who has lost her sight
still finds purpose in praying for her children and grandchildren and
influencing them to trust God.

Psalm 139 says that before we were born “all the days ordained for
[us] were written in [His] book” (v. 16). We are “fearfully and
wonderfully made” to bring glory to our Creator (v. 14).

Never forget: You have purpose!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, it often seems that our lives swing from drudgery to challenges
we don’t want. Today help us to see You in the midst of whatever faces
us. Show us a small glimpse of the purpose and meaning You bring to
everything.

Even when everything seems meaningless, God still has a purpose for
your life.
