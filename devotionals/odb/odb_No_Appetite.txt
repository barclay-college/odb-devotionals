No Appetite

As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow
thereby. —
1 Peter 2:2

Today's Scripture: Nehemiah 8:1-12

When I was battling a bad cold recently, I lost my appetite. I could
go through an entire day without eating much food. Water would
suffice. But I knew I couldn’t survive long on water alone. I needed
to regain my appetite because my body needed nourishment.

When the people of Israel came back from exile in Babylon, their
spiritual appetite was weak. They had departed from God and His ways.
To get the people back to spiritual health, Nehemiah organized a Bible
seminar, and Ezra was the teacher.

Ezra read from the book of the law of Moses from morning until midday,
feeding the people with the truth of God (Neh. 8:3). And the people
listened attentively. In fact, their appetite for God’s Word was so
stirred that the family leaders and the priests and Levites met with
Ezra the following day to study the law in greater detail because they
wanted to understand it (v.13).

When we feel estranged from God or spiritually weak, we can find
spiritual nourishment from God’s Word. “As newborn babes, desire the
pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby” (1 Peter 2:2). Ask
God to give you a renewed desire for relationship with Him, and begin
feeding your heart, soul, and mind with His Word.

Reflect & Pray

Break Thou the Bread of life, dear Lord, to me, As Thou didst break
the loaves beside the sea; Beyond the sacred page I seek Thee, Lord,
My spirit pants for Thee, O living Word. — Lathbury

Feeding on God’s Word keeps us strong and healthy in the Lord.
