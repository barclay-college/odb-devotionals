Seeing The Person Inside

From now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. —
2 Corinthians 5:16

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 5:12-21

On February 1, 1960, four students from an all-black college sat down
at a “whites only” lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. One of
them, Franklin McCain, noticed an older white woman seated nearby
looking at them. He was sure that her thoughts were unkind toward them
and their protest against segregation. A few minutes later she walked
over to them, put her hands on their shoulders, and said, “Boys, I am
so proud of you.”

Recalling the event years later on National Public Radio, McCain said
he learned from this never to stereotype anyone. Instead he should
pause to consider others and seek an opportunity to talk with them.

The first-century church, like ours today, was often fractured by
divisions based on race, language, and culture. Paul wrote to the
followers of Jesus in Corinth to help them respond to those who were
more concerned with outward appearance than with what is in the heart
(2 Cor. 5:12). Because Christ died for all, Paul said, “From now on,
we regard no one according to the flesh” (v.16).

May we all look closely to see the person inside, for everyone is made
in the image of God and can become a new creation in Christ.

Reflect & Pray

First impressions can mislead us For we do not know the heart; We can
often be mistaken Since we only know in part. —Fitzhugh

It’s what’s in the heart that matters.
