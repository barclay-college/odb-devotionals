Keep Up the Good Work

We . . . urge you . . . to do this more and more.
1 Thessalonians 4:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 4:1–12

My son loves to read. If he reads more books than what is required at
school, he receives an award certificate. That bit of encouragement
motivates him to keep up the good work.

When Paul wrote to the Thessalonians he motivated them not with an
award but with words of encouragement. He said, “Brothers and sisters,
we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you
are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this
more and more” (1 Thess. 4:1). These Christians were pleasing God
through their lives, and Paul encouraged them to continue to live more
and more for Him.

Maybe today you and I are giving our best to know and love and please
our Father. Let’s take Paul’s words as an incentive to continue on in
our faith.

But let’s go one step further. Who might we encourage today with
Paul’s words? Does someone come to mind who is diligent in following
the Lord and seeking to please Him? Write a note or make a phone call
and urge this person to keep on in their faith journey with Him. What
you say may be just what they need to continue following and serving
Jesus.
