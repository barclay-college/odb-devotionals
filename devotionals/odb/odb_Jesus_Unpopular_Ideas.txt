Jesus’ Unpopular Ideas

Give to the one who asks you.
Matthew 5:42

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 5:38–48

For fifteen years, Mike Burden held hate-filled meetings in the
memorabilia shop he ran in his small town. But in 2012 when his wife
began to question his involvement, his heart softened. He realized how
wrong his racist views were and didn’t want to be that person any
longer. The militant group retaliated by kicking his family out of the
apartment they’d been renting from one of the members.

Where did he turn for help? Surprisingly, he went to a local black
pastor with whom he’d clashed. The pastor and his church provided
housing and groceries for Mike’s family for some time. When asked why
he agreed to help, Pastor Kennedy explained, “Jesus Christ did some
very unpopular things. When it’s time to help, you do what God wants
you to do.” Later Mike spoke at Kennedy’s church and apologized to the
black community for his part in spreading hatred.

Jesus taught some unpopular ideas in the Sermon on the Mount: “Give to
the one who asks you . . . . Love your enemies and pray for those who
persecute you” (Matthew 5:42, 44). That’s the upside-down way of
thinking God calls us to follow. Though it looks like weakness, it’s
actually acting out of God’s strength.

The One who teaches us is the One who gives the power to live out this
upside-down life in whatever way He asks of us.

Reflect & Pray

How are you living out Jesus’ words of giving to those who ask and
loving your enemies? What would you like to change?

God, help me to love others as You love me. Show me how to do that
today.
