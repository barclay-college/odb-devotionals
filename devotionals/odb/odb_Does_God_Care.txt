Does God Care?

Hear, O Lord, and have mercy on me; Lord, be my helper! —
Psalm 30:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 30

Minnie and George Lacy were faced with some questions: “Is Jesus
enough? Is our relationship with Christ sufficient to sustain us? Will
He be enough to help us want to go on living? Does He care?”

While serving as missionaries in 1904, the Lacys’ youngest daughter
fell ill. Then in rapid succession, all five of their children died
from scarlet fever, none living to see the new year. In letters to the
mission board George Lacy wrote about their deep loneliness and grief:
“Sometimes it seems more than we can bear.” But then he added, “The
Lord is with us and is wonderfully helping us.” In this, their darkest
time, they found that Jesus was near and He was enough.

Many of us will face moments when we will wonder if we can go on. If
our health fails, if our job disappears, if we lose those closest to
us, will we find our relationship with the Lord real enough to keep us
pressing forward?

The psalmist reminds us of God’s presence and faithfulness (Ps. 30).
When he was deeply depressed, he cried out, “Hear, O Lord, and have
mercy on me; Lord, be my helper!” (v.10). God gave Him healing and
comfort (vv.2-3).

As believers in Jesus, we will never lack what we need to persevere.
The Lord will always be near.

Reflect & Pray

Though tempted and sadly discouraged, My soul to this refuge will flee
And rest in the blessed assurance, “My grace is sufficient for thee.”
—Anon.

Faith in an all-sufficient Christ enables us to press on.
