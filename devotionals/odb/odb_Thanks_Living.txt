Thanks-Living

Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life.
Psalm 23:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 23

Wanting to mature in her spiritual life and become more thankful, Sue
started what she called a Thanks-Living jar. Each evening she wrote on
a small piece of paper one thing she thanked God for and dropped it in
the jar. Some days she had many praises; other difficult days she
struggled to find one. At the end of the year she emptied her jar and
read through all of the notes. She found herself thanking God again
for everything He had done. He had given simple things like a
beautiful sunset or a cool evening for a walk in the park, and other
times He had provided grace to handle a difficult situation or had
answered a prayer.

Sue’s discovery reminded me of what the psalmist David says he
experienced (Ps. 23). God refreshed him with “green pastures” and
“quiet waters” (vv. 2–3). He gave him guidance, protection, and
comfort (vv. 3–4). David concluded: “Surely your goodness and love
will follow me all the days of my life” (v. 6).

I’m going to make a Thanks-Living jar this year. Maybe you’d like to
as well. I think we’ll see we have many reasons to thank God—including
His gifts of friends and family and His provisions for our physical,
spiritual, and emotional needs. We’ll see that the goodness and love
of God follow us all the days of our lives.
