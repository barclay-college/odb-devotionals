A Good Name

A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches. —
Proverbs 22:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 10:2-15

Charles Ponzi’s name will be forever associated with the financial
fraud scheme he elevated to a way of life. After some minor financial
crimes and brief times in jail, in early 1920 he began offering
investors a 50 percent return on their money in 45 days and a 100
percent return in 90 days. Although it seemed too good to be true, the
money poured in. Ponzi used money from new investors to pay prior
investors and fund his lavish lifestyle. By the time his fraud was
discovered in August 1920, investors had lost 20 million dollars and
five banks had failed. Ponzi spent 3 years in prison, was later
deported to Italy, and died penniless in 1949 at the age of 66.

The Old Testament book of Proverbs frequently contrasts the
reputations of wise and foolish people: “The memory of the righteous
is blessed, but the name of the wicked will rot. . . . He who walks
with integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will
become known” (Prov. 10:7,9). Solomon sums it up by saying, “A good
name is to be chosen rather than great riches, loving favor rather
than silver and gold” (22:1).

We seek a good name, not to honor ourselves but to glorify Christ our
Lord whose name is above all names.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You know what is best, and You desire to lead us in paths that
are right and good. Give us the courage to trust and to follow You in
the way of right living for Your name’s sake.

A good name honors our great God.
