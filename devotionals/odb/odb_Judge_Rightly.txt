Judge Rightly

You have not spoken of Me what is right. —
Job 42:7

Today's Scripture: Job 42:1-8

After a national news magazine posted an online story listing my
community as one of the top-10 dying cities in the nation, local
citizens were outraged. They registered their indignation, pointing
out evidence to the contrary. One resident went to great lengths to
disprove the harsh judgment. He recruited local citizens to show up
downtown and appear in a video that showcased the vibrancy of our
community. The video received international attention, and the news
magazine admitted it was wrong. But the organization that had done the
“research” stood by the conclusion, even though it was based on
limited criteria.

Their self-defense surprised me because their careless conclusion
seemed indefensible. But then I thought of how common it is to make
faulty judgments based on minimal information. One of the classic
biblical examples is that of Job’s friends. They wrongly concluded
that because a series of tragedies happened to him, Job had sinned.

In the end, God defended Job and offered a startling conclusion. He
didn’t rebuke his friends for judging Job but for speaking falsely
about Himself (Job 42:7). This is a humbling reminder that when we
make careless judgments about others, we are sinning against God.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please restrain my lips when I’m tempted to say what I shouldn’t
say about people made in Your image. Use my words to bless and not
harm. May I reflect Your heart.

If you are a Christian, remember that people judge your Lord by you.
