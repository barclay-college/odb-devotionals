Faithful To The Finish

Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. —
Hebrews 12:1

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 12:1-4

After running 32 kilometers (20 miles) of the Salomon Kielder Marathon
in Great Britain, a runner dropped out and rode a bus to a wooded area
near the finish line. Then, he re-entered the race and claimed third
prize. When officials questioned him, he stated that he stopped
running because he was tired.

Many of us can relate to the exhaustion of a worn-out athlete as we
run the race of the Christian faith. The book of Hebrews encourages us
to “run with endurance the race that is set before us” (12:1). Running
with endurance requires that we lay aside the sin that stands in our
way and shed the weights that hold us back. We may even have to press
on through persecution (2 Tim. 3:12).

To prevent weariness and discouragement in our souls (Heb. 12:3), the
Bible urges us to focus on Christ. When we pay more attention to Him
than to our struggles, we will notice Him running alongside
us—supporting us when we stumble (2 Cor. 12:9) and encouraging us with
His example (1 Peter 2:21-24). Keeping our eyes on “the author and
finisher of our faith” (Heb. 12:2) will help us stay close to the
source of our strength and remain faithful to the finish.
