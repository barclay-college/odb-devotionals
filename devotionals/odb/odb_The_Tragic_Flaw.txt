The Tragic Flaw

His fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he
became strong. —
2 Chronicles 26:15

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 26:3-15

In literature, a tragic flaw is a character trait that causes the
downfall of a story’s hero. That was true of Uzziah, who was crowned
king of Judah at age 16. For many years, he sought the Lord; and while
he did, God gave him great success (2 Chron. 26:4-5). But things
changed when “his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously
helped till he became strong. But when he was strong his heart was
lifted up, to his destruction” (vv.15-16).

Uzziah entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar
(v.16), openly defying God’s decree. Perhaps pride convinced him that
God’s rules applied to everyone except him. When Uzziah raged against
the priests who told him this was not right, the Lord struck him with
leprosy (vv.18-20).

In literature and in life, how often we see a person of good
reputation fall from honor into disgrace and suffering. “King Uzziah
was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in an isolated house,
. . . cut off from the house of the Lord” (v.21).

The only way we can prevent the nectar of praise from becoming the
poison of pride is by following the Lord with a humble heart.
