Following The Master

At the command of the Lord they remained encamped, and at the command
of the Lord they journeyed. —
Numbers 9:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Numbers 9:15-23

At a dog show near my home, I watched a Cardigan Welsh corgi named
Trevor perform. At his master’s command, he ran several yards away and
immediately returned, he jumped fences, and he identified objects
using his sense of smell. After finishing each exercise, he sat down
at his master’s feet and waited for more instructions.

Trevor’s careful attention to his master’s instruction reminded me of
the devotion God desired from His people as they followed Him through
the wilderness. God led in a unique way. His presence appeared as a
cloud. If the cloud ascended, He wanted His people to move to another
area. If the cloud descended, they were to stay put. “At the command
of the Lord they remained encamped, and at the command of the Lord
they journeyed” (Num. 9:23). The Israelites followed this practice day
or night, regardless of how long they had to remain in one place.

God wasn’t simply testing the Israelites; He was leading them to the
Promised Land (10:29). He wanted to take them to a better place. So it
is with us when God asks us to follow Him. He wants to lead us to a
place of closer fellowship with Himself. His Word assures us that He
is loving and faithful in leading those who humbly follow Him.

Reflect & Pray

In fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet, Or we’ll walk by His side
in the way; What He says we will do, where He sends we will go; Never
fear, only trust and obey. —Sammis

God asks His children to follow the Leader.
