Overshadowed

The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will
overshadow you. —
Luke 1:35

Today's Scripture: Luke 1:26-38

The assassination of US President John F. Kennedy stunned people
around the globe 50 years ago today. The day after the shooting, an
article in The Times (London) spoke of the reverberations being felt
throughout world financial markets. It carried the headline, “All
Other Events Overshadowed by US Tragedy.”

There are times in our lives when a death, a tragedy, or a sudden turn
of events eclipses everything else. It happened to an unmarried young
woman who was told that she would become the mother of the promised
Messiah, God’s Son (Luke 1:26-33). When she asked how this could
happen, the angel Gabriel said, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
and the power of the Highest will overshadow you” (v.35).

The impossibility in Mary’s life was overshadowed not by darkness but
by the brightness of God’s glory and power. Her response continues to
leave us in awe: “Let it be to me according to your word” (v.38).

In the coming weeks, as we read again the Christmas story and consider
the birth of Jesus into our world, it’s worth pondering the word
overshadowed. It speaks so powerfully of the Lord’s presence in our
hearts and His ability to outshine the darkest moments.

Reflect & Pray

I’m overshadowed by His mighty love, Love eternal, changeless, pure,
Overshadowed by His mighty love, Rest is mine, serene, secure. —

In every situation, we are overshadowed by God’s mighty love and
power.
