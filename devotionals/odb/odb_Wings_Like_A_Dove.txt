Wings Like A Dove

Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest. —
Psalm 55:6

Today's Scripture: Psalm 55:4-22

David sighed, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and
be at rest” (Ps. 55:6). As for me, I’d build a cabin in the Sawtooths,
or take a permanent post in a fire-lookout tower. When life weighs on
me, I too yearn to fly away and be at rest.

David wrote freely about his circumstances: Violence, oppression, and
strife surrounded him on all sides, stirred up by the disloyalty of an
old friend (55:8-14). Fear and terror, pain and trembling, anxiety and
restlessness overwhelmed him (vv.4-5). Is it any wonder he longed to
fly away?

But escape was impossible. He could not evade his lot. He could only
give his circumstances to God: “As for me, I will call upon God, and
the Lord shall save me. Evening and morning and at noon I will pray,
and cry aloud, and He shall hear my voice” (vv.16-17).

Whatever our circumstances—a burdensome ministry, a difficult
marriage, joblessness, or a deep loneliness—we can give them to God.
He has lifted the burden of our sins; will He not lift the weight of
our sorrows? We have trusted Him with our eternal souls; can we not
entrust our present circumstances to Him? “Cast your burden on the
Lord, and He shall sustain you” (55:22).

Reflect & Pray

Are you ever burdened with a load of care? Does the cross seem heavy
you are called to bear? Count your many blessings, every doubt will
fly, And you will be singing as the days go by. —Oatman

Because God cares about us, we can leave our cares with Him.
