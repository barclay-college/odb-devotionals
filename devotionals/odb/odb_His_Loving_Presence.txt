His Loving Presence

Never will I leave you.
Hebrews 13:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 13:1–6

Our hearts sank when we learned that our good friend Cindy had been
diagnosed with cancer. Cindy was a vibrant person whose life blessed
all who crossed her path. My wife and I rejoiced when she went into
remission, but a few months later her cancer returned with a
vengeance. In our minds she was too young to die. Her husband told me
about her last hours. When she was weak and hardly able to talk, Cindy
whispered to him, “Just be with me.” What she wanted more than
anything in those dark moments was his loving presence.

The writer to the Hebrews comforted his readers by quoting Deuteronomy
31:6, where God told His people: “Never will I leave you; never will I
forsake you” (Heb. 13:5). In the darkest moments of life, the
assurance of His loving presence gives us confidence that we are not
alone. He gives us the grace to endure, the wisdom to know He is
working, and the assurance that Christ can “empathize with our
weaknesses” (4:15).

Together let’s embrace the blessing of His loving presence so we can
confidently say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid” (13:6).

Lord, thank You for the promise that You will never leave me. May the
