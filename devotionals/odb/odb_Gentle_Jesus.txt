Gentle Jesus

Unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no
means enter the kingdom of heaven. —
Matthew 18:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 18:1-10

Charles Wesley (1707–1788) was a Methodist evangelist who wrote more
than 9,000 hymns and sacred poems. Some, like “O for a Thousand
Tongues to Sing,” are great, soaring hymns of praise. But his poem
“Gentle Jesus, Meek and Mild,” first published in 1742, is a child’s
quiet prayer that captures the essence of how all of us should seek
the Lord in sincere, simple faith.

Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb,

In Thy gracious hands I am;

Make me, Savior, what Thou art,

Live Thyself within my heart.

When some followers of Jesus were jockeying for position in His
kingdom, the Lord “called a little child to Him, set him in the midst
of them, and said, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted
and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom
of heaven’” (Matt. 18:2-3).

Not many children seek position or power. Instead, they want
acceptance and security. They cling to the adults who love and care
for them. Jesus never turned children away.

The last stanza of Wesley’s poem shows a childlike desire to be just
like Jesus: “I shall then show forth Thy praise / Serve Thee all my
happy days; / Then the world shall always see / Christ, the holy
Child, in me.”

Reflect & Pray

Father, give me the faith of a little child. I want to know Your love
and care, and to rest in Your embrace. Grant my desire to be like You
in all my ways that I might live for Your honor.

Faith shines brightest in a childlike heart.
