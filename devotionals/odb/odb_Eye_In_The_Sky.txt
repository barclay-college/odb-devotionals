Eye In The Sky

The Lord will guide you continually. —
Isaiah 58:11

Today's Scripture: Psalm 139:1-10

Creating a system by which an “eye in the sky” can help guide cars and
planes and boats all the time is complicated. For instance, the Global
Positioning System (GPS) that most people are familiar with works
because there are always 24 to 32 satellites orbiting the Earth at an
altitude of 12,500 miles. These satellites must maintain a constant
speed and altitude if the guidance they provide is to be accurate.

Today’s complicated GPS is just a tiny analogy of what God can do. God
promised the nation of Israel: “The Lord will guide you continually”
(Isa. 58:11). The psalmist was aware that there was no place he could
go without God knowing where he was (Ps. 139:7-8). Long before GPS,
God sat “above the circle of the earth” (Isa. 40:22) and saw
everything.

The knowledge that there is someone who tracks you wherever you are
can bring fear to those who are trying to get away. But for the
Christian, this brings great joy and assurance. No matter where he
was, the psalmist was confident that God’s hand would lead him (Ps.
139:10).

God has promised to guide and lead you today. He’s the best Guide you
could have, and He wants to lead you along the right paths.

Reflect & Pray

We need God’s guidance from above; And as we trust Him for direction,
His daily leading and His love, He’ll give to us His full protection.

To avoid going wrong, follow God’s leading.
