Bad Faith, Good Faith

[Abraham] did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God,
but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God.
Romans 4:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 4:18–25

“You gotta have faith,” people say. But what does that mean? Is any
faith good faith?

“Believe in yourself and all that you are,” wrote one positive thinker
a century ago. “Know that there is something inside you that is
greater than any obstacle.” As nice as that may sound, it falls to
pieces when it crashes into reality. We need a faith in something
bigger than ourselves.

God promised Abram he would have a multitude of descendants (Gen.
15:4–5), so he faced a huge obstacle—he was old and childless. When he
and Sarah got tired of waiting for God to make good on His promise,
they tried to overcome that obstacle on their own. As a result, they
fractured their family and created a lot of unnecessary dissension
(see Gen. 16 and 21:8–21).

Nothing Abraham did in his own strength worked. But ultimately he
became known as a man of tremendous faith. Paul wrote of him, “Against
all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many
nations, just as it had been said to him, ‘So shall your offspring
be’” (Rom. 4:18). This faith, said Paul, “was credited to him as
righteousness” (v. 22).

Abraham’s faith was in something far bigger than himself—the one and
only God. It’s the object of our faith that makes all the difference.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I want a strong faith in You, not just faith in myself or my
abilities or in others. I am nothing without You.

Our faith is good if it’s in the right Person.
