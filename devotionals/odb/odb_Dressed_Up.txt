Dressed Up

Clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 13:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 13:11–14

In her book Wearing God, author Lauren Winner says our clothes can
silently communicate to others who we are. What we wear may indicate
career, community or identity, moods, or social status. Think of a
T-shirt with a slogan, a business suit, a uniform, or greasy jeans and
what they might reveal. She writes, “The idea that, as with a garment,
Christians might wordlessly speak something of Jesus—is appealing.”

According to Paul, we can similarly wordlessly represent Christ.
Romans 13:14 tells us to “clothe [ourselves] with the Lord Jesus
Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the
flesh.” What does this mean? When we become Christians, we take on
Christ’s identity. We’re “children of God through faith” (Gal.
3:26–27). That’s our status. Yet each day we need to clothe ourselves
in His character. We do this by striving to live for and to be more
like Jesus, growing in godliness, love, and obedience and turning our
back on the sins that once enslaved us.

This growth in Christ is a result of the Holy Spirit working in us and
our desire to be closer to Him through study of the Word, prayer, and
time spent in fellowship with other Christians (John 14:26). When
others look at our words and attitudes, what statement are we making
about Christ?

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, we want to be a reflection of You. Help us to look more
like You each day. Grow us in godliness, love, joy, and patience.

When others see us, may what they see speak well of the Savior.
