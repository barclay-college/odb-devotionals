Open Wide!

As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow
thereby. —
1 Peter 2:2

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 2:1-5

Early in the spring, my wife and I watched a fascinating bird show
outside our kitchen window. A couple of blackbirds with straw in their
beaks entered a small vent in the house next door. A couple of weeks
later, to our delight, we saw four baby birds stick their heads out of
the vent. Mom and Dad took turns feeding their hungry babies.

Seeing the babies’ wide-open mouths reminded me of how important it is
for followers of Christ to eagerly desire spiritual food. In 1 Peter
2:2, the apostle Peter uses the analogy of babies longing to be fed:
“As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow
thereby.” The Greek word translated “desire” speaks of an intense
yearning. It is a compound word meaning to “earnestly desire” or to
“long after.”

It might seem strange to be commanded to earnestly long for something.
But unlike hungry birds and babies, we need to be reminded of our need
for spiritual nourishment. Even though we may have fed on the Word in
the past (v.3), we need to realize that our need is ongoing and that
without more nourishment we will grow spiritually weak. God is eager
to feed His dear children. So, open wide!

Reflect & Pray

My hunger for the truth He satisfies; Upon the Word, the Living Bread,
I feed: No parching thirst I know, because His grace, A pool of
endless depth, supplies my need. —Sanders

Neglecting the Word will famish your soul; meditating on the Word will
feed it.
