Love Your Neighbor

For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love
your neighbor as yourself.”
Galatians 5:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 13:8–11

An anthropologist was winding up several months of research in a small
village, the story is told. While waiting for a ride to the airport
for his return flight home, he decided to pass the time by making up a
game for some children. His idea was to create a race for a basket of
fruit and candy that he placed near a tree. But when he gave the
signal to run, no one made a dash for the finish line. Instead the
children joined hands and ran together to the tree.

When asked why they chose to run as a group rather than each racing
for the prize, a little girl spoke up and said: “How could one of us
be happy when all of the others are sad?” Because these children cared
about each other, they wanted all to share the basket of fruit and
candy.

After years of studying the law of Moses, the apostle Paul found that
all of God’s laws could be summed up in one: “Love your neighbor as
yourself” (Gal. 5:14; see also Rom. 13:9). In Christ, Paul saw not
only the reason to encourage, comfort, and care for one another but
also the spiritual enablement to do it.

Because He cares for us, we care for each other.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for the love You shower on us day by day. Teach us,
in turn, to care for others. Open our eyes to see their need and
respond as You want us to.

We show our love for God when we love one another.
