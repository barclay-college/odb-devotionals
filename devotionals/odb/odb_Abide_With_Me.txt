Abide With Me

Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things
as you have. For He Himself has said, “I will never leave you nor
forsake you.” —
Hebrews 13:5

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 13:1-8

One of the highlights of English football (soccer) each year is the
final match of the annual FA Cup Final. For more than a hundred years,
the day has been marked by excitement, festivity, and competition. But
what fascinates me is how the game begins. It starts with the singing
of the traditional hymn “Abide With Me.”

At first that struck me as odd. What does that hymn have to do with
football? As I thought about it, though, I realized that for the
follower of Christ it has everything to do with sports, shopping,
working, going to school, or anything else we do. Since there is no
corner of our lives that should not be affected by the presence of
God, the longing that He would abide with us is actually the most
reasonable thing we could desire. Of course, the presence of our
heavenly Father is not something we need to plead for—it is promised
to us. In Hebrews 13:5, we read, “For [God] Himself has said, ‘I will
never leave you nor forsake you.’”

Not only is God’s presence the key to our contentment, but it is also
the promise that can give us wisdom, peace, comfort, and strength—no
matter where we are or what we are doing.
