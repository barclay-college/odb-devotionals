Sin Hurts

He poured out His soul unto death, and He was numbered with the
transgressors, and He bore the sin of many. —
Isaiah 53:12

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 2:10-18

Sooner or later we all feel the painful effects of sin. Sometimes it’s
the weight of our own sin and the shame and embarrassment of having
failed miserably. At other times, it’s the load of someone else’s sin
that weighs us down—someone who betrayed, deceived, abandoned,
ridiculed, cheated, or made a fool of us.

Think about a time when the weight of that guilt or pain was so heavy
that you couldn’t pull yourself out of bed. Now try to imagine the
heaviness of the combined grief that everyone’s sin has caused your
family, your church, your neighborhood. Add to that all the suffering
sin has caused everyone in your city, state, nation, and the world.
Now try to imagine the accumulated grief that sin has caused
throughout the centuries since creation.

Is it any wonder that the weight of all this sin began squeezing the
life out of Jesus on the night He was called to bear it? (Matt.
26:36-44). The next day, even His beloved Father would forsake Him. No
other suffering can compare.

Sin put Jesus to the ultimate test. But His love endured it, His
strength bore it, and His power overcame it. Thanks to Jesus’ death
and resurrection, we know beyond a doubt that sin will not and cannot
win.

Reflect & Pray

Is God aloof from human pain That ravages our mortal frame? Oh, no,
Christ felt our agony When sin and death He overcame! —D. De Haan

Christ’s empty tomb guarantees our victory over sin and death.
