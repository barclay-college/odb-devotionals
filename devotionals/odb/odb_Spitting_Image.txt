Spitting Image

The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all
creation.
Colossians 1:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:15–23

During an outing, we met a woman who had known my husband’s family
since he was a child. She looked from Alan to our son, Xavier. “He’s
the spitting image of his daddy,” she said. “Those eyes. That smile.
Yep. Looks just like him.” As the woman delighted in acknowledging
such a strong resemblance between father and son, she even noted
similarities in their personalities. Still, though they are alike in
many ways, my son doesn’t reflect his father perfectly.

There’s only one Son—Jesus—who reflects His Father completely.
Christ is the “image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all
creation” (Colossians 1:15). In Him and through Him and for Him all
things were created (v. 16). “He is before all things, and in him all
things hold together” (v. 17).

We can spend time in prayer and Bible study, discovering the Father’s
character by looking at Jesus—God in the flesh. He invites us to
witness His love in action by examining how He interacts with others
in Scripture and in our day-to-day living. After surrendering our
lives to Christ and receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, we can grow
in knowing and trusting our loving Father. He transforms us to reflect
His character, so we can live for Him.

What a joy it would be if others could say we look just like Jesus!
