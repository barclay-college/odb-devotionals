Facing The Future

If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that. —
James 4:15

Today's Scripture: James 4:13-17

While going through some old files, I came across a 1992 special issue
of TIME magazine titled “Beyond the Year 2000: What To Expect in the
New Millennium.” It was fascinating to read the predictions made 2
decades ago about what the future would hold. Some general
observations were on target, but no one foresaw many of the events and
innovations that have radically changed our lives. The most telling
statement to me was, “The first rule of forecasting should be that the
unforeseen keeps making the future unforeseeable.”

James reminds us that any view of the future that omits God is foolish
and proud. “Come now, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to
such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a
profit’; whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. . . .
Instead you ought to say, ‘If the Lord wills, we shall live and do
this or that’” (James 4:13-15).

Many people used to begin their statement of plans with, “Lord
willing.” The phrase may have become trite, but the acknowledgment of
God’s overruling hand is not.

As we look ahead with God firmly in view, we can face the future with
confidence in His loving plan.

Reflect & Pray

God holds the future in His hands With grace sufficient day by day,
Through good or ill He gently leads, If we but let Him have His way.
—Rohrs

Those who know Christ as Savior can face the future with joy.
