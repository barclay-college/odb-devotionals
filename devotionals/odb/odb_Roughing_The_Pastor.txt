Roughing The Pastor

Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor,
especially those who labor in the Word and doctrine. —
1 Timothy 5:17

Today's Scripture: 1 Timothy 5:17-25

I was at my grandson’s eighth-grade football game when the referee
indicated there was a penalty and stopped play. Apparently, after the
ball was thrown, the boy who passed it was tackled, prompting a
penalty flag. The announcer from the press box said: “There is a flag
on the field. The penalty is roughing the pastor . . . I mean,
roughing the passer.” As soon as he said it, I thought to myself, God
could give that penalty to some churches today!

It’s not that pastors are perfect. If that is what we are looking for,
then pastorless churches would be the norm. It’s that God calls on us
to honor those who lead us spiritually, particularly “those who labor
in preaching and teaching” (1 Tim. 5:17 ESV). In my opinion, pastoring
is one of the hardest occupations on the planet. We live in a
sophisticated, fast-paced, and complex world, and our expectations for
“high-performance” pastors often set the bar at unattainable heights.

So, let’s switch the focus and become high-performance church members
who honor our pastors with words of encouragement and prayer. A
supportive note or a “thank you” in the foyer will go a long way to
stimulate pastors to serve with joy and efficiency.
