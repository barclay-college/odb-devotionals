Assembly Required

Be anxious for nothing, but . . . let your requests be made known to
God. —
Philippians 4:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:4-13

When our daughter and her fiancé began receiving wedding presents, it
was a happy time. One gift they received was a bench cabinet that had
to be assembled—and I volunteered for the task because they already
had so much to do to prepare for the wedding. Although it took a
couple of hours, it was much easier than expected. All of the wooden
pieces were precut and predrilled, and all the hardware for assembly
was included. The instructions were virtually foolproof.

Unfortunately, most of life isn’t that way. Life doesn’t carry with it
simple instructions, nor do we find all of the necessary parts in
hand. We face situations with no clear idea of what we’re getting into
or what it will take to pull it off. We can easily find ourselves
overwhelmed with these difficult moments.

But we need not face our burdens alone. God wants us to bring them to
Him: “Be anxious for nothing, but . . . let your requests be made
known to God; and the peace of God . . . will guard your hearts and
minds through Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:6-7).

We have a Savior who understands and offers His peace in the midst of
our struggles.

Perfect peace and rest. —Havergal

The secret of peace is to give every anxious care to God.
