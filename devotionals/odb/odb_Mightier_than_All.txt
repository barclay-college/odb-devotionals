Mightier than All

The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed in majesty
and armed with strength.
Psalm 93:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 93

Iguazu Falls, on the border of Brazil and Argentina, is a spectacular
waterfall system of 275 falls along 2.7 km (1.67 miles) of the Iguazu
River. Etched on a wall on the Brazilian side of the Falls are the
words of Psalm 93:4, “Mightier than the thunders of many waters,
mightier than the waves of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty!”
(rsv). Below it are these words, “God is always greater than all of
our troubles.”

The writer of Psalm 93, who penned its words during the time that
kings reigned, knew that God is the ultimate King over all. “The Lord
reigns,” he wrote. “Your throne was established long ago; you are from
all eternity” (vv. 1–2). No matter how high the floods or waves, the
Lord remains greater than them all.

The roar of a waterfall is truly majestic, but it is quite a different
matter to be in the water hurtling toward the falls. That may be the
situation you are in today. Physical, financial, or relational
problems loom ever larger and you feel like you are about to go over
the falls. In such situations, the Christian has Someone to turn to.
He is the Lord, “who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask
or imagine” (Eph. 3:20) for He is greater than all our troubles.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I know that You are powerful and greater than any trouble that
might come my way. I trust You to carry me through.

Never measure God’s unlimited power by your limited expectations.
