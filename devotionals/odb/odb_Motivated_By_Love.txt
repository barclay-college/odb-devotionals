Motivated By Love

The love of Christ compels us. —
2 Corinthians 5:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 5:11–17

In the 1920s, Bobby Jones dominated the golfing world, despite being
an amateur. In one film about his life, Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius,
there is a scene where a professional golfer asks Bobby when he is
going to quit being an amateur and grab for the money like everyone
else does. Jones answers by explaining that the word amateur comes
from the Latin amo—to love. His answer was clear: He played golf
because he loved the game.

Our motives, why we do what we do, make all the difference. This
certainly applies to those who are followers of Jesus Christ. In his
letter to the Corinthian church, Paul gives us an example of this.
Throughout the epistle he defended his conduct, character, and calling
as an apostle of Christ. In response to those who questioned his
motives for ministry, Paul said, “Christ’s love compels us, because we
are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he
died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves
but for him who died for them and was raised again” (2 Cor. 5:14-15
niv).

Christ’s love is the greatest of all motivators. It causes those who
follow Him to live for Him, not for themselves.

Reflect & Pray

What are some of the ways your understanding of Christ and His love
has shaped your motives and your actions? In what ways would you like
to see God work in you now?

We are shaped and fashioned by what we love most.
