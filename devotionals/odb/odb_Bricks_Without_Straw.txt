Bricks Without Straw

I will rescue you . . . , and I will redeem you with an outstretched
arm. —
Exodus 6:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 6:1-13

Many of us face the challenge of working with limited resources.
Equipped with less money, less time, dwindling energy, and fewer
helpers, our workload may remain the same. Sometimes, it even
increases. There’s a saying that sums up this predicament: “More
bricks, less straw.”

This phrase refers to the Israelites’ hardship as slaves in Egypt.
Pharaoh decided to stop supplying them with straw, yet he required
them to make the same number of bricks each day. They scoured the land
to find supplies, while Pharaoh’s overseers beat them and pressured
them to work harder (Ex. 5:13). The Israelites became so discouraged
that they didn’t listen when God said through Moses, “I will rescue
you . . . , and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm” (6:6).

Although the Israelites refused to hear God’s message, God was still
guiding and directing Moses, preparing him to speak to Pharaoh. God
remained firmly on Israel’s side—at work behind the scenes. Like the
Israelites, we can become so downhearted that we ignore encouragement.
In dark times, it’s comforting to remember that God is our deliverer
(Ps. 40:17). He is always at work on our behalf, even if we can’t see
what He is doing.
