Sweet Scent

Thanks be to God, who . . . uses us to spread the aroma of the
knowledge of him everywhere.
2 Corinthians 2:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 2:14–16

Author Rita Snowden tells a delightful story about visiting a small
village in Dover, England. Sitting outside a café one afternoon
enjoying a cup of tea, she became aware of a beautiful scent. Rita
asked a waiter where it was coming from, and was told it was the
people she could see passing by. Most of the villagers were employed
at a nearby perfume factory. As they walked home, they carried the
fragrance that permeated their clothes out into the street.

What a beautiful image of the Christian life! As the apostle Paul
says, we are the aroma of Christ, spreading His fragrance everywhere
(2 Cor. 2:15). Paul uses the image of a king returning from battle,
his soldiers and captives in tow, wafting the smell of celebratory
incense in the air, declaring the king’s greatness (v. 14).

We spread the aroma of Christ in two ways. First, through our words:
telling others about the One who is beautiful. Second, through our
lives: doing deeds of Christlike sacrifice (Eph. 5:1–2). While not
everyone will appreciate the divine fragrance we share, it will bring
life to many.

Rita Snowden caught a scent and was driven to seek its source. As we
follow Jesus we too become permeated with His fragrance, and we carry
His aroma into the streets through our words and deeds.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, make us carriers and communicators of Your beauty to the
people in our homes, offices, and neighborhoods.

We are the aroma of Christ to others.
