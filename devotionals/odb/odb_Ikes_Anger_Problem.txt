Ike’s Anger Problem

He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty. —
Proverbs 16:32

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 16:21-33

On June 6, 1944, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander, was
the most powerful man on earth. Under his authority, the largest
amphibious army ever assembled prepared to liberate the Nazi-dominated
continent of Europe. How was Eisenhower able to lead such a vast army?
Part of the answer can be linked to his remarkable skill in working
with different kinds of people.

What many do not know, however, is that Ike hadn’t always gotten along
with others. As a boy, he often got into fistfights at school. But
fortunately he had a caring mother who instructed him in God’s Word.
One time, when she was bandaging his hands after an angry outburst,
she quoted Proverbs 16:32, “He who is slow to anger is better than the
mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.” Years
later, Eisenhower wrote, “I have always looked back on that
conversation as one of the most valuable moments of my life.”
Undoubtedly, by learning to control his anger, Eisenhower was able to
work effectively with others.

Inevitably, each of us will at times be tempted to lash out in anger.
Yet through God’s work in our lives we can learn to control our anger.
What better way to influence people than through a gentle spirit.
