Unfinished Works

Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be
to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!
Romans 7:24–25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 7:14–25

At his death, the great artist Michelangelo left many unfinished
projects. But four of his sculptures were never meant to be completed.
The Bearded Slave, the Atlas Slave, the Awakening Slave, and the Young
Slave, though they appear unfinished, are just as Michelangelo
intended them to be. The artist wanted to show what it might feel like
to be forever enslaved.

Rather than sculpting figures in chains, Michelangelo made figures
stuck in the very marble out of which they are carved. Bodies emerge
from the stone, but not completely. Muscles flex, but the figures are
never able to free themselves.

My empathy with the slave sculptures is immediate. Their plight is not
unlike my struggle with sin. I am unable to free myself: like the
sculptures I am stuck, “a prisoner of the law of sin at work within
me” (Rom 7:23). No matter how hard I try, I cannot change myself. But
thanks be to God, you and I will not remain unfinished works. We won’t
be complete until heaven, but in the meantime as we welcome the
transforming work of the Holy Spirit, He changes us. God promises to
finish the good work He has begun in us (Phil. 1:6).

Reflect & Pray

God, thank You that You make us new creatures through the work of Your
Son Jesus Christ, freeing us from our slavery to sin.

He is the potter; we are the clay.
