An Ordinary Day

Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. —
Matthew 24:42

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 24:36-44

While exploring a museum exhibit titled “A Day in Pompeii,” I was
struck by the repeated theme that August 24, ad 79 began as an
ordinary day. People were going about their daily business in homes,
markets, and at the port of this prosperous Roman town of 20,000
people. At 8 a.m., a series of small emissions were seen coming from
nearby Mount Vesuvius, followed by a violent eruption in the
afternoon. In less than 24 hours, Pompeii and many of its people lay
buried under a thick layer of volcanic ash. Unexpected.

Jesus told His followers that He would return on a day when people
were going about their business, sharing meals, and having weddings,
with no idea of what was about to happen. “As the days of Noah were,
so also will the coming of the Son of Man be” (Matt. 24:37).

The Lord’s purpose was to urge the disciples to be watchful and
prepared: “Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming
at an hour you do not expect” (v.44).

What surprising joy it would be to welcome our Savior on this ordinary
day!
