A Debt Of Gratitude

[They] risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give
thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. —
Romans 16:4

Today's Scripture: Romans 16:1-16

Dave Randlett was someone of whom I can say, “Because of him, my life
will never be the same.” Dave, who went to heaven in October 2010,
became a mentor to me when I was a new follower of Jesus in my college
years. He not only invested time in me, but he took risks by giving me
opportunities to learn and grow in ministry. Dave was God’s instrument
to give me the opportunity to be a student preacher and travel with a
college music team. As a result, he helped shape and prepare me for a
life of teaching God’s Word. I’m glad I was able to express thanks to
him on a number of occasions.

Just as I am thankful for Dave’s influence in my life, the apostle
Paul was grateful for Aquila and Priscilla, who served the Lord with
him. He said they “risked their own necks for my life.” In gratitude,
he thanked them, as did “all the churches of the Gentiles” (Rom.
16:4).

You too may have people in your life who have taken risks by giving
you opportunities to serve or who have greatly influenced you
spiritually. Perhaps pastors, ministry leaders, friends, or family
members have given of themselves to move you further along for Christ.
The question is, have you thanked them?
