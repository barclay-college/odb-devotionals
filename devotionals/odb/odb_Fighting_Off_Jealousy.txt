Fighting Off Jealousy

For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not
carnal and behaving like mere men? —
1 Corinthians 3:3

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 3:1-10

The story is told of two shopkeepers who were bitter rivals. They
spent each day keeping track of each other’s business. If one got a
customer, he would smile triumphantly at his rival.

One night an angel appeared to one of the shopkeepers in a dream and
said, “I will give you anything you ask, but whatever you receive,
your competitor will receive twice as much. What is your desire?” The
man frowned and then said, “Strike me blind in one eye.” Now that’s
jealousy of the worst kind!

The self-destructive emotion of jealousy had the potential of tearing
apart the Corinthian church. These believers had received the gospel
but had not allowed the Holy Spirit to change their hearts. As a
result, they became jealous of one another, which led to a divided
community. Paul identified their jealousy as a sign of immaturity and
worldliness (1 Cor. 3:3). These believers were not acting like people
who had been transformed by the gospel.

One of the clearest indicators that the Holy Spirit is working in our
lives is our contentment and our thankfulness for what we have. Then,
instead of experiencing jealousy, we are able to genuinely celebrate
the gifts and blessings of others.

Reflect & Pray

God, You are so good! You have provided all we need and so much more.
Help us to be content with what we have, knowing that without You we
would have neither life nor breath.

The remedy for jealousy is thankfulness to God.
