New Birth

You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb. —
Psalm 139:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:7-16

What is there about babies that makes us smile? Many people will stop
everything at the sight or sound of a baby and will flock to gaze at
the little one. I noticed this when I visited my dad at a nursing
home. Though most of the residents were wheelchair-bound and suffered
from dementia, the visit of a family with a baby almost unfailingly
brought a spark of joy to their eyes that—tentatively at first but
then undoubtedly—became a smile. It was amazing to watch.

Perhaps babies bring a smile because of the wonder of a new life—so
precious, tiny, and full of promise. Seeing a baby can remind us of
our awesome God and the great love He has for us. He loved us so much
that He gave us life and formed us in our mother’s womb. “You formed
my inward parts,” the psalmist says, “You covered me in my mother’s
womb” (Ps. 139:13).

Not only does He give us physical life but He also offers us spiritual
rebirth through Jesus (John 3:3-8). God promises believers new bodies
and life eternal when Jesus returns (1 Cor. 15:50-52).

Physical life and spiritual rebirth—gifts to celebrate from our
Father’s hand.
