The Best Gift Ever

Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give
the reason for the hope that you have.
1 Peter 3:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 3:8–16

At a winter retreat in northern New England, one of the men asked the
question, “What was your favorite Christmas gift ever?”

One athletic man seemed eager to answer. “That’s easy,” he said,
glancing at his friend next to him. “A few years back, I finished
college thinking I was a sure bet to play professional football. When
it didn’t happen, I was angry. Bitterness ate at me, and I shared that
bitterness with anyone who tried to help me.”

“On the second Christmas—and second season without football—I went to
a Christmas play at this guy’s church,” he said, gesturing toward his
friend. “Not because I wanted Jesus, but just to see my niece in her
Christmas pageant. It’s hard to describe what happened because it
sounds silly, but right in the middle of that kids’ play, I felt like
I needed to be with those shepherds and angels meeting Jesus. When
that crowd finished singing ‘Silent Night,’ I just sat there weeping.

“I got my best Christmas present ever that very night,” he said, again
pointing to his friend, “when this guy sent his family home without
him so he could tell me how to meet Jesus.”

It was then that his friend piped up: “And that, guys, was my best
Christmas present ever.”

This Christmas, may the joyful simplicity of the story of Jesus’s
birth be the story we tell to others.
