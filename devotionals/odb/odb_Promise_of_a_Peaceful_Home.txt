Promise of a Peaceful Home

Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree,
and no one will make them afraid.
Micah 4:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Micah 4:1–5

Sixty-five million. That’s the number of refugees in our world
today—people who have had to leave their homes due to conflict and
persecution—and it’s higher than it’s ever been. The UN has petitioned
leaders to work together in receiving refugees so that every child
will get an education, every adult will find meaningful work, and
every family will have a home.

The dream of making homes for refugees in crisis reminds me of a
promise God made to the nation of Judah when ruthless Assyrian armies
threatened their homes. The Lord commissioned the prophet Micah to
warn the people that they would lose their temple and their beloved
city of Jerusalem. But God also promised a beautiful future beyond the
loss.

A day will come, said Micah, when God will call the peoples of the
world to Himself. Violence will end. Weapons of war will become
farming tools, and every person who answers God’s call will find a
peaceful home and a productive life in His kingdom (4:3–4).

For many in the world today, and maybe for you, a safe home remains
more a dream than a reality. But we can rely on God’s ancient promise
of a home for people of all nations, even as we wait and work and pray
for those peaceful homes to become a reality.
