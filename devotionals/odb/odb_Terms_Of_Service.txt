Terms Of Service

Forgive, and you will be forgiven. —
Luke 6:37

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 6:27-37

If you’re like me, you seldom read the full text of contracts for
online services before you agree to them. They go on for pages, and
most of the legal jargon makes no sense to ordinary people like me.

I was quite surprised, therefore, when a friend from Africa made me
aware of this one-of-a-kind service agreement for online software.
Instead of a wordy license telling people how not to use it, the
developer offers a simple blessing urging people to use it for good:

May you do good and not evil. May you find forgiveness for yourself
and forgive others. May you share freely, never taking more than you
give.

At first I thought, Wow. Imagine if more terms of service agreements
were written as blessings instead of legal documents. Then I thought,
The agreement Jesus makes with us is like that. He offers us
forgiveness of sin, peace with God, and the presence of the Holy
Spirit. In return, all He asks is that we do good (Gal. 6:10), forgive
as we’ve been forgiven (Luke 6:37), and love others as He loves us
(John 13:34).

The beauty of Jesus’ agreement with us is that even though we fail to
live up to the terms, we still receive the blessing.
