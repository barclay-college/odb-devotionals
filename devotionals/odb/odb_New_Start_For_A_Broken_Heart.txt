New Start For A Broken Heart

He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted. —
Isaiah 61:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 61:1-3

The Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb, Croatia, is filled with
anonymously donated remnants of love gone wrong. There is an axe that
a jilted lover used to destroy the furniture of an offending partner.
Stuffed animals, love letters framed in broken glass, and wedding
dresses all speak volumes of heartache. While some visitors to the
museum leave in tears over their own loss, some couples depart with
hugs and a promise not to fail each other.

The Old Testament prophet Isaiah wrote, “The Spirit of the Lord God is
upon Me, because the Lord has anointed Me to preach good tidings to
the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted” (Isa. 61:1). When
Jesus read from Isaiah 61 at the synagogue in Nazareth, He said,
“Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing” (Luke 4:21).
Extending far beyond help for an emotional wound, Isaiah’s words speak
of a changed heart and a renewed spirit that come by receiving God’s
gift of “beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
praise for the spirit of heaviness” (Isa. 61:3).

All of us have experienced regret and broken promises in our lives.
Whatever has happened, the Lord invites us to find healing, hope, and
new life in Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You are the promise-keeping God who has said He will make all
things new. Today we give You our ashes in exchange for Your beauty,
our mourning for the joy of finding comfort in You. Thank You!

God can transform tragedies into triumphs.
