The Offering Plate

See that you abound in this grace also. —
2 Corinthians 8:7

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 8:1-9

Ed Dobson, my former pastor, often said that he disliked preaching
about financial giving to the church. He said his previous job
required fundraising, so he didn’t like putting any unnecessary
pressure on people. But when he was teaching through 2 Corinthians,
and he came to chapters 8 and 9, he couldn’t avoid the topic of
giving. What I remember most about his sermon was the illustration he
used. He placed an offering plate on the floor, stepped into it, and
stood there as he talked about the importance of giving our whole
selves to the Lord, not just our wallets.

Those two chapters in Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians give us
a number of attitudes and actions that we are to display in our giving
to the Lord:

• Give yourself to the Lord first (8:5).

• Give, remembering the example of the Lord Jesus (8:9).

• Give according to your means (8:11-12).

• Give enthusiastically because of God’s love (9:2).

• Give generously, not grudgingly or because of outside pressure
(9:5-7).

Next time the offering plate comes around at church, imagine yourself
stepping into it. It will help you to excel in the grace of giving
(8:7).

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord Jesus, for giving Yourself for me on the cross.
Because of Your love, I give all of me— my heart, my time, my funds,
my will—to You. I love You.

When we give ourselves completely to the Lord, all lesser giving
becomes easier.
