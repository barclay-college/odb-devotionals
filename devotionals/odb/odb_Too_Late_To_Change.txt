Too Late To Change?

Nicodemus said to [Jesus], “How can a man be born when he is old?” —
John 3:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 3:1-8,13-16

There are sayings in many languages about the difficulty of changing
long-established habits. In English, “You can’t teach an old dog new
tricks.” In French, “Ce n’est pas à un vieux singe qu’on apprend à
faire la grimace” (You can’t teach an old monkey how to pull a funny
face). In Spanish, “El loro viejo no aprende a hablar” (An old parrot
can’t learn to speak).

When Jesus told Nicodemus that he must be “born again” to “see the
kingdom of God,” he replied, “How can a man be born when he is old?
Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?” (John
3:3-4). Professor and author Merrill Tenney suggests that Nicodemus
was saying, in effect, “I acknowledge that a new birth is necessary,
but I am too old to change. My pattern of life is set. Physical birth
is out of the question and psychological rebirth seems even less
probable . . . . Is not my case hopeless?”

Jesus’ reply included these words, “For God so loved the world that He
gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not
perish but have everlasting life” (v.16). That is the offer of new
life and a new beginning for anyone, young or old.

Whatever our age or situation in life, with God’s power, it’s not too
late to change.

Reflect & Pray

Father, old habits are hard to break, new ones are harder to learn,
and sometimes we don’t want to do either. Thank You for Your
faithfulness to continue teaching us new ways, Your ways.

Because God is powerful, change is possible.
