Responding to God’s Leading

At once they left their nets and followed him.
Matthew 4:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 3:7–14

In August 2015, when I was preparing to attend a university a couple
of hours from home, I realized I probably wouldn’t move back home
after graduation. My mind raced. How can I leave home? My family? My
church? What if God later calls me to another state or country?

Like Moses, when God told him to go “to Pharaoh to bring [His] people
the Israelites out of Egypt” (Exodus 3:10), I was afraid. I didn’t
want to leave my comfort zone. Yes, Moses obeyed and followed God, but
not before questioning Him and requesting that someone else go instead
(vv. 11–13; 4:13).

In Moses’s example, we can see what we shouldn’t do when we sense a
clear calling. We can instead strive to be more like the disciples.
When Jesus called them, they left everything and followed Him (Matthew
4:20–22; Luke 5:28). Fear is natural, but we can trust God’s plan.

Being so far from home is still difficult. But as I continually seek
God, He opens doors for me that confirm I am where I’m supposed to be.

When we are led out of our comfort zone, we can either go reluctantly,
like Moses, or willingly like the disciples—who followed Jesus
wherever He led them. Sometimes this means leaving our comfortable
life hundreds or even thousands of miles behind us. But no matter how
difficult it may be, following Jesus is worth it.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to follow You wherever You lead.

We are not called to be comfortable.
