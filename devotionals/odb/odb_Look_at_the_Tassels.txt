Look at the Tassels

Remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them. —
Numbers 15:39

Today's Scripture & Insight: Numbers 15:37-41

Best-selling author Chaim Potok began his novel The Chosen by
describing a baseball game between two Jewish teams in New York City. 
Reuven Malter, the book’s main character, notices that the opposing
players’ uniforms have a unique accessory—four long ropelike tassels
that extend below each teammate’s shirt. Reuven recognizes the tassels
as a sign of strict obedience to God’s Old Testament laws.

The history of these fringes—known as tzitzit—began with a message
from God. Through Moses, God told His people to create tassels
containing some strands of blue thread and attach them to the four
corners of their top garments (Num. 15:38). God said, “You may look
upon [the tassels] and remember all the commandments of the Lord and
do them” (v. 39).

God’s memory device for the ancient Israelites has a parallel for us
today. We can look at Christ who consistently kept the whole law in
our place and obeyed His heavenly Father (John 8:29). Having received
His work on our behalf, we now “put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make
no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts” (Rom. 13:14).
Keeping our eyes on God’s Son helps us to honor our heavenly Father.
