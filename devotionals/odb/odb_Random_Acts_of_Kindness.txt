Random Acts of Kindness

“Why have I found such favor [grace] in your eyes that you notice me—a
foreigner?”
Ruth 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ruth 2:8–13

Some say that the American writer Anne Herbert scribbled the phrase
“Practice random acts of kindness and senseless acts of beauty” on a
placemat at a restaurant in 1982. The sentiment has since been
popularized through film and literature and has become a part of our
vocabulary.

The question is “Why?” Why should we show kindness? For those who
follow Jesus, the answer is clear: To show the tender mercy and
kindness of God.

There’s an Old Testament example of that principle in the story of
Ruth, the emigrant from Moab. She was a foreigner, living in a strange
land whose language and culture she did not understand. Furthermore,
she was desperately poor, utterly dependent on the charity of a people
who took little notice of her.

There was one Israelite, however, who showed Ruth grace and spoke to
her heart (Ruth 2:13). He allowed her to glean in his fields, but more
than simple charity, he showed her by his compassion the tender mercy
of God, the One under whose wings she could take refuge. She became
Boaz’s bride, part of the family of God, and one in a line of
ancestors that led to Jesus, who brought salvation to the world (see
Matt. 1:1–16).

We never know what one act of kindness, done in Jesus’s name, will do.
