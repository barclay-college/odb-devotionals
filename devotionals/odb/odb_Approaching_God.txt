Approaching God

But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign
Lord my refuge.
Psalm 73:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 4:14–16

A woman desiring to pray grabbed an empty chair and knelt before it.
In tears, she said, “My dear heavenly Father, please sit down here;
you and I need to talk!” Then, looking directly at the vacant chair,
she prayed. She demonstrated confidence in approaching the Lord; she
imagined He was sitting on the chair and believed He was listening to
her petition.

A time with God is an important moment when we engage the Almighty.
God comes near to us as we draw near to Him in a mutual involvement
(James 4:8). He has assured us, “I am with you always” (Matt. 28:20).
Our heavenly Father is always waiting for us to come to Him, always
ready to listen to us.

There are times when we struggle to pray because we feel tired,
sleepy, sick, and weak. But Jesus sympathizes with us when we are weak
or face temptations (Heb. 4:15). Therefore we can “approach God’s
throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find
grace to help us in our time of need” (v. 16).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You that I can pray to You in all places at all times. Put
the desire to come near to You in my heart. I want to learn to come to
You in faith and in confidence. For help in your prayer time, read In
His Presence at discoveryseries.org/q0718.

God is everywhere, is available every time, and listens always.
