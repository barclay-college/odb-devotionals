Not Again!

God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification
by the Spirit and belief in the truth.
2 Thessalonians 2:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Thessalonians 2:13-17

As I was reading the text message on my mobile phone, my temperature
started to rise and my blood began to boil. I was on the verge of
shooting back a nasty message when an inner voice told me to cool down
and reply tomorrow. The next morning after a good night’s sleep, the
issue that had upset me so greatly seemed so trivial. I had blown it
out of proportion because I didn’t want to put another person’s
interest before my own. I was unwilling to inconvenience myself so I
could help someone.

Regretfully, I am tempted to respond in anger more often than I would
like to admit. I constantly find myself having to put into practice
familiar Bible truths, such as “Be angry, and do not sin” (Eph. 4:26)
and “Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also
for the interests of others” (Phil. 2:4).

Thankfully, God has given us His Spirit who will assist us in our
battle with our sin. The apostles Paul and Peter called it the
“sanctifying work of the Spirit” (2 Thess. 2:13; 1 Peter 1:2 niv).
Without His power, we are helpless and defeated; but with His power,
we can have victory.
