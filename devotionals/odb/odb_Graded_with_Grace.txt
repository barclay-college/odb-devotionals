Graded with Grace

While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans 5:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:6–15

My son’s blue eyes sparkled with excitement as he showed me a paper he
had brought home from school. It was a math test, marked with a red
star and a grade of 100 percent. As we looked at the exam, he said he
had three questions left to answer when the teacher said time was up.
Puzzled, I asked how he could have received a perfect score. He
replied, “My teacher gave me grace. She let me finish the test
although I had run out of time.”

As my son and I discussed the meaning of grace, I pointed out that God
has given us more than we deserve through Christ. We deserve death
because of our sin (Rom. 3:23). Yet, “while we were still sinners,
Christ died for us” (5:8). We were unworthy, yet Jesus—sinless and
holy—gave up His life so we could escape the penalty for our sin and
one day live forever in heaven.

Eternal life is a gift from God. It’s not something we earn by working
for it. We are saved by God’s grace, through faith in Christ (Eph.
2:8–9).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, Your undeserved favor has made it possible for us to be
saved from our sin. You have shown us amazing grace. Thank You for the
gift You gave. Use me to tell others about You and what You have done.

Grace and mercy are unearned blessings.
