Perfect Peace And Rest

You, who have shown me great and severe troubles, shall revive me
again. —
Psalm 71:20

Today's Scripture: Psalm 71:19-24

The psalmist had seen “great and severe troubles” (Ps. 71:20). Yet
hovering in the back of his mind was the thought that God would
“revive” him again. The literal meaning of this phrase is “bring him
to life again.” He elaborated: “[You shall] bring me up again from the
depths of the earth [the grave]. You shall increase my greatness, and
comfort me on every side” (vv.20-21). If the troubles didn’t end in
this life, certainly in heaven they would.

This thought—that someday we shall be in God’s presence and enjoy Him
forever—crowns many of the psalms and is an assurance that helps
life’s present troubles fade away (see Ps. 16,17,49,73).

Perhaps no one but God knows the trouble you’ve seen, but this is not
all that shall be. Someday, your Father will “increase [your]
greatness”—you will be clothed with unspeakable glory. There will be
comfort “on every side.” His presence and love will bring perfect
peace and rest.

Richard Baxter writes, “O what a blessed day that will be when I shall
. . . stand on the shore and look back on the raging seas I have
safely passed; when I shall review my pains and sorrows, my fears and
tears, and possess the glory which was the end of all!”

Reflect & Pray

When all my labors and trials are o’er, And I am safe on that
beautiful shore, Just to be near the dear Lord I adore Will through
the ages be glory for me. —Gabriel

When God wipes our tears, sorrow will give way to eternal song.
