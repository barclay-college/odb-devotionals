Character Or Reputation?

You have a name that you are alive, but you are dead. —
Revelation 3:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 3:1-6

Legendary basketball coach John Wooden (1910–2010) believed that
character is far more important than reputation. “Your reputation is
what you’re perceived to be by others,” Coach Wooden often told his
players, “but your character is what you really are. You’re the only
one that knows your character. You can fool others, but you can’t fool
yourself.”

In the book of Revelation, we find the words of the risen Christ to
seven churches in Asia. To the church in Sardis, Jesus said, “I know
your works, that you have a name [reputation] that you are alive, but
you are dead” (Rev. 3:1). The Lord knew the truth about them, and no
doubt deep down they knew it too. Jesus told them to wake up and
strengthen the spiritual life inside them that was about to die (v.2).
He urged them to remember the truth they had received, obey it, then
turn around and start moving in a new direction (v.3).

When the Lord shows us what’s wrong in our lives, He always provides a
remedy for change. When we turn from our sins, He forgives and
strengthens us to start over.

How liberating to exchange a false spiritual reputation for the true,
life-giving character that comes from knowing Christ our Lord!

Reflect & Pray

Men talk too much of gold and fame, And not enough about a name; And
yet a good name’s better far Than all earth’s glistening jewels are.

The true test of our character is what we do when no one is watching.
