Significant Surrender

Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you
in due time. —
1 Peter 5:6

Today's Scripture: Luke 1:26-38

Throughout history, Mary the mother of Jesus has been held in high
esteem. And rightly so! She was singled out by God to deliver the
long-awaited Messiah.

But before we get lost in the significance of her life, let’s take a
look at what it meant for her to surrender to the assignment. Living
in a small backwater Galilean village where everyone knew everyone
else’s business, she would have to live with the perceived shame of
her premarital pregnancy. Explaining to her mother the visits of the
angel and the Holy Spirit probably didn’t calm things down. To say
nothing of the devastating interruption that her pregnancy would bring
to her plans to marry Joseph. And while we are thinking about Joseph,
what would she tell him? Would he believe her?

In light of these personal ramifications, her response to the angel
who told her the news about her role as Jesus’ mother is amazing:
“Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to
your word” (Luke 1:38 ESV). Her words remind us that a life of
significance is most often preceded by a heart eager to surrender to
God’s will regardless of the cost.

What significant experience does God have in store for you? It starts
with surrender to Him.
