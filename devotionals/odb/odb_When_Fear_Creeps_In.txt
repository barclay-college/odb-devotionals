When Fear Creeps In

Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in [God]. —
Psalm 56:3

Today's Scripture: Psalm 56

When my daughter exclaimed, “Mommy, a bug!” I looked where she was
pointing and saw the largest spider I have ever encountered outside of
a pet shop. Both the spider and I knew that he would not be allowed to
stay in our house. And yet, as I faced him, I found I could not take
one step closer to end the standoff. My pulse quickened. I swallowed
and gave myself a pep-talk. Still, fear kept me frozen in place.

Fear is powerful; it can override logical thinking and produce
irrational behavior. Thankfully, Christians don’t have to let fear of
anything—people, situations, or even spiders—rule our actions. We can
declare, “Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in [God]” (Ps. 56:3).

Taking this stand against fear is consistent with the Bible’s
instruction to “trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on
your own understanding” (Prov. 3:5). Our own understanding may lead us
to overestimate the object of our fear and underestimate God’s power.
When we are afraid, we can depend on God’s understanding (Isa. 40:28)
and trust in His love for us that “casts out fear” (1 John 4:18). The
next time fear creeps into your life, don’t panic. God can be trusted
in the darkness.

Reflect & Pray

Into His hands I lay the fears that haunt me, The dread of future ills
that may befall; Into His hands I lay the doubts that taunt me, And
rest securely, trusting Him for all. —Christiansen

Trusting God’s faithfulness dispels our fearfulness.
