The Link To Life

According to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of
regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. —
Titus 3:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Titus 3:1-11

By the time he was 16, Morris Frank (1908–1980) had lost his sight in
both eyes. Several years later, he traveled to Switzerland where he
met Buddy, the canine who would help to inspire Frank’s involvement
with the Seeing Eye guide-dog school.

With Buddy leading the way, Frank learned to navigate busy sidewalks
and intersections. Describing the freedom his guide provided, Frank
said, “It was glorious: just [Buddy] and a leather strap, linking me
to life.” Buddy gave Morris Frank a new kind of access to the world
around him.

God’s Holy Spirit gives us access to abundant spiritual life in
Christ. When we accept Christ as Lord, God washes our sins away and
renews us “by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us generously
through Jesus Christ our Savior” (Titus 3:5-6 niv). Once we know
Christ, the Holy Spirit helps us experience God’s love (Rom. 5:5),
understand God’s Word (John 14:26), pray (Rom. 8:26), and abound in
hope (Rom. 15:13).

Today, as you think about your relationship with God, remember that
the Spirit is your guide to life in Christ (Rom. 8:14).
