Beautiful Scars

Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. —
Luke 7:47

Today's Scripture: Luke 7:36-49

A number of years ago I was hiking along the Salmon River and came
across a grove of pine trees that had been partially stripped of their
bark. I knew from a friend who is a forester that the Native Americans
who hunted this area long ago had peeled the outer bark and harvested
the underlying layer for chewing gum. Some of the scars were
disfiguring, but others, filled with crystallized sap and burnished by
wind and weather, had been transformed into patterns of rare beauty.

So it is with our transgressions. We may be scarred by the sins of the
past. But those sins, repented of and brought to Jesus for His
forgiveness, can leave behind marks of beauty.

Some people, having tasted the bitterness of sin, now loathe it. They
hate evil and love righteousness. Theirs is the beauty of holiness.

Others, knowing how far they fall short (Rom. 3:23), have tender
hearts toward others. They rise up with understanding, compassion, and
kindness when others fail. Theirs is the beauty of humility.

Finally, when acts of sin are freely and thoroughly forgiven it leads
to intimacy with the One who has shown mercy. Such sinners love much
for much has been forgiven (Luke 7:47). Theirs is the beauty of love.
