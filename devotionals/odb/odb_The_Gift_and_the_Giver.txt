The Gift and the Giver

Because of God’s tender mercy, the morning light from heaven is about
to break upon us.
Luke 1:78

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 1:67–79

It’s only a keychain. Five little blocks held together by a shoelace.
My daughter gave it to me years ago when she was seven. Today the lace
is frayed and the blocks are chipped, but they spell a message that
never grows old: “I ♥ DAD.”

The most precious gifts are determined not by what went into them, but
by who they are from. Ask any parent who ever received a bouquet of
dandelions from a chubby hand. The best gifts are valued not in money
but in love.

Zechariah understood that. We hear it in his prophetic song as he
praised God for giving him and his wife Elizabeth their son John when
they were well past their childbearing years (Luke 1:67–79). Zechariah
rejoiced because John was to be a prophet who would proclaim God’s
greatest gift to all people—the coming Messiah: “Because of God’s
tender mercy, the morning light from heaven is about to break upon us”
(Luke 1:78 nlt). Those words point to a gift given with so much love
that it will even “shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow
of death” (1:79).

The sweetest gift we can receive is God’s tender mercy—the forgiveness
of our sins through Jesus. That gift cost Him dearly at the cross, but
He offers it freely out of His deep love for us.
