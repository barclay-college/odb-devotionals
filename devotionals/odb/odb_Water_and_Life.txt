Water and Life

Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,
but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.”
John 4:13-14

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 4:1-15

As Dave Mueller reached down and turned the handle, water rushed from
the spigot into a blue bucket. Around him people applauded. They
celebrated as they saw fresh, clean water flowing in their community
for the first time. Having a clean source of water was about to change
the lives of this group of people in Kenya.

Dave and his wife, Joy, work hard to meet people’s needs by bringing
them water. But they don’t stop with H2O. As they help bring people
clean water, they also tell them about Jesus Christ.

Two thousand years ago, a man named Jesus stood at a Samaritan well
and talked with a woman who was there to get clean drinking water for
her physical health. But Jesus told her that what she needed even more
than that was living water for her spiritual health.

As history has marched on and humanity has become more sophisticated,
life still filters down to two truths: Without clean water, we will
die. More important, without Jesus Christ, the source of living water,
we are already dead in our sins.

Water is essential to our existence—both physically with H2O and
spiritually with Jesus. Have you tasted of the water of life that
Jesus, the Savior, provides?

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Jesus, for being our living water. Thank You for Your
willingness to die on the cross and for Your power to rise from the
dead in order to provide us that water.

Only Jesus has the living water to quench our spiritual thirst.
