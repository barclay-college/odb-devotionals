Quarantined by Fear

Seek his kingdom.
Luke 12:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 12:22–34

In 2020, an outbreak of the coronavirus left the world in fear. People
were quarantined, countries were put under lockdown, flights and large
events were canceled. Those living in areas with no known cases still
feared they might get the virus. Graham Davey, an expert in anxiety,
believes that negative news broadcasts are “likely to make you sadder
and more anxious.” A meme that circulated on social media showed a man
watching the news on TV, and he asked how to stop worrying. In
response, another person in the room reached over and flipped off the
TV, suggesting that the answer might be a shift in focus!

Luke 12 gives us some advice to help us stop worrying: “Seek his
kingdom” (v. 31). We seek God’s kingdom when we focus on the promise
that His followers have an inheritance in heaven. When we face
difficulty, we can shift our focus and remember that God sees us and
knows our needs (vv. 24–30).

Jesus encourages His disciples: “Do not be afraid, little flock, for
your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom” (v. 32). God
enjoys blessing us! Let’s worship Him, knowing He cares for us more
than the birds of the air and the flowers of the field (vv. 22–29).
Even in difficult times, we can read the Scriptures, pray for God’s
peace, and trust in our good and faithful God.
