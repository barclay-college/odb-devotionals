Fear And Love

What does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear [Him] . . .
and to love Him. —
Deuteronomy 10:12

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 10:12-17

Someone shared with me her observation about two bosses. One is loved
but not feared by his subordinates. Because they love their boss but
don’t respect his authority, they don’t follow his guidelines. The
other boss is both feared and loved by those who serve under him, and
their good behavior shows it.

The Lord desires that His people both fear and love Him too. Today’s
Bible passage, Deuteronomy 10, says that keeping God’s guidelines
involves both. In verse 12, we are told “to fear the Lord your God”
and “to love Him.”

To “fear” the Lord God is to give Him the highest respect. For the
believer, it is not a matter of feeling intimidated by Him or His
character. But out of respect for His person and authority, we walk in
all His ways and keep His commandments. Out of “love,” we serve Him
with all our heart and with all our soul—rather than merely out of
duty (v.12).

Love flows out of our deep gratitude for His love for us, rather than
out of our likes and dislikes. “We love Him because He first loved us”
(1 John 4:19). Our fear and love for God enable us to walk willingly
in obedience to God’s law.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You are holy and Your thoughts are much higher than mine. I bow
before You. Thank You for salvation in Jesus. I love You and want to
obey You with all of my heart, soul, mind, and strength. Amen.

If we fear and love God, we will obey Him.
