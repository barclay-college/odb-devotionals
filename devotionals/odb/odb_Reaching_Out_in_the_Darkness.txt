Reaching Out in the Darkness

The night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.
Psalm 139:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:7-12

Our old dog—a West Highland white terrier—sleeps curled up at the foot
of our bed. That’s been her place for 13 years.

Normally she doesn’t move or make a sound, but lately she’s been
pawing us gently in the middle of the night. At first we thought she
wanted to go outside, so we tried to accommodate her. But we realized
she just wants to know we are there. She’s nearly deaf and partially
blind now. She can’t see in the darkness and can’t hear us move or
breathe. Naturally, she gets confused and reaches out for reassurance.
So I just reach down and pat her on the head to assure her that I’m
there. That’s all she wants to know. She takes a turn or two, settles
down, and goes back to sleep.

“Where can I flee from your presence?” David asked God (Ps. 139:7).
David took this as an immense comfort. “If I settle on the far side of
the sea, even there your hand will guide me,” he noted. “Even the
darkness will not be dark to you” (vv. 9-12).

Lost in darkness? Grieving, fearful, guilty, doubting, discouraged?
Not sure of God? The darkness is not dark to Him. Though unseen, He is
at hand. He has said, “Never will I leave you; never will I forsake
you” (Heb. 13:5). Reach out your hand for His. He is there.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You promised never to leave us or forsake us. We know Your word
is true, but so often we see the obstacles and the challenges and lose
sight of You. Help us today to see more of You and less of our
problems.

Dark fears flee in the light of God’s presence.
