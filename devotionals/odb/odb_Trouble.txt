Trouble

In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have
overcome the world. —
John 16:33

Today's Scripture: John 16:25-33

I was glad to see the final days of the year draw to a close. It had
held so much sorrow, sickness, and sadness. I was ready to welcome
January with its very own brass band!

But as the first month of the new year arrived, so did one bit of sad
news after another. Several friends lost their parents. My dad’s
brother slipped away in his sleep. Friends discovered they had cancer.
A colleague’s brother and a friend’s son both died tragically and
abruptly. Rather than the sad times ceasing, the new year seemed to
bring a whole new tsunami of sorrow.

John 16:33 tells us, “In the world you will have tribulation.” Even
God’s children are not promised a life of ease, of prosperity, nor of
good health. Yet we are never alone in our trouble. Isaiah 43:2
reminds us that when we pass through deep waters, God is with us.
Although we don’t always understand God’s purposes in the trials we
experience, we can trust His heart because we know Him.

Our God is a God of abundant love and “neither death nor life. . . nor
things present nor things to come [will ever] separate us from the
love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 8:38-39). When
trouble comes, His presence is His promise.

Reflect & Pray

Swift cometh His answer, so clear and so sweet; “Yea, I will be with
thee, thy troubles to meet; I will not forget thee, nor fail thee, nor
grieve; I will not forsake thee, I never will leave.” —Flint

Faith is believing that God is present when all we hear is silence.
