On Time

When the set time had fully come, God sent his Son.
Galatians 4:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:25–38

Sometimes I joke that I’m going to write a book titled On Time. Those
who know me smile because they know I am often late. I rationalize
that my lateness is due to optimism, not to lack of trying. I
optimistically cling to the faulty belief that “this time” I will be
able to get more done in less time than ever before. But I can’t, and
I don’t, so I end up having to apologize yet again for my failure to
show up on time.

In contrast, God is always on time. We may think He’s late, but He’s
not. Throughout Scripture we read about people becoming impatient with
God’s timing. The Israelites waited and waited for the promised
Messiah. Some gave up hope. But Simeon and Anna did not. They were in
the temple daily praying and waiting (Luke 2:25–26, 37). And their
faith was rewarded. They got to see the infant Jesus when Mary and
Joseph brought Him to be dedicated (vv. 27–32, 38).

When we become discouraged because God doesn’t respond according to
our timetable, Christmas reminds us that “when the set time had fully
come, God sent his Son . . . that we might receive adoption to
sonship” (Gal. 4:4–5). God’s timing is always perfect, and it is worth
the wait.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, I confess that I become impatient and discouraged,
wanting answers to prayer in my own time and on my schedule. Help me
to wait patiently for Your timing in all things.

God’s timing is always right—wait patiently for Him.
