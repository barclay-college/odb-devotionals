Silent Helper

I will praise Your name, for You have done wonderful things.
Isaiah 25:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 25:1-9

The discovery of penicillin revolutionized health care. Prior to the
1940s, bacterial infections were often fatal. Since then, penicillin
has saved countless lives by killing harmful bacteria. The men who
recognized its potential and developed it for widespread use won a
Nobel Prize in 1945.

Long before the discovery of penicillin, other silent killers were at
work saving lives by destroying bacteria. These silent killers are
white blood cells. These hard workers are God’s way of protecting us
from disease. No one knows how many invasions they have stopped or how
many lives they have saved. They receive little recognition for all
the good they do.

The Lord gets similar treatment. He often gets blamed when something
goes wrong, but He seldom gets credit for all the things that go
right. Every day people get up, get dressed, drive to work or school
or the grocery store, and return safely to their families. No one
knows how many times God has protected us from harm. But when there is
a tragedy, we ask, “Where was God?”

When I consider all the wonderful things that God does silently on my
behalf each day (Isa. 25:1), I see that my list of praises is much
longer than my list of petitions.

In what ways does God’s goodness undergird your life? What are you
thanking Him for today?

God keeps giving us reasons to praise Him.
