Why They Are Grand

Older women . . . [are to] admonish the young women to love their
husbands, to love their children. —
Titus 2:3-4

Today's Scripture: Titus 2:1-5

Grandparents are great bridge-builders. My grandparents, farmers on
both sides of the family, were children of the 19th century and
relayed an important heritage of both history and faith through the
years.

Today, my children benefit from their grandparents’ faith because they
can see that my wife and I have personally accepted the faith modeled
for us. And our children have seen and heard their grandparents’
testimonies of faith for themselves.

In a sense, it seems strange that grandparents can have such far-
reaching influence. After all, they can be separated in age from their
grandchildren by 40 to 70 years. Yet they have an uncanny ability to
bridge that generation gap—sometimes even better than parents can.

Older Christians, including grandparents, have a unique responsibility
and opportunity—that of example and instruction—which either directly
or indirectly keeps the heritage of faith alive from generation to
generation.

Let’s be thankful for the strong heritage of faith, love, and family
that grandparents can leave to those who come after them. And
grandparents should seize every opportunity of relating to their
grandchildren, so that their faith will become the faith of their
children’s children.

Reflect & Pray

I do not ask for mighty words To leave them all impressed, But grant
my life may ring so true My family will be blessed. —Anon.

The richest inheritance a grandparent can leave is a godly example.
