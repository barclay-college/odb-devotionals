Asking Different Questions

Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? —
Job 38:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 38:1-11

When tragedy strikes, questions follow. Our loss of a loved one may
lead us to ask God any number of pointed questions: “Why did You let
this happen?” “Whose fault was this?” “Don’t You care about my pain?”
Believe me, as the grieving father of a teenager who died tragically I
have asked these very questions.

The book of Job records the questions Job asks as he sits down with
friends to lament his suffering. He had lost his family as well as his
health and possessions. At one point, he asks, “Why is light given to
him who is in misery, and life to the bitter of soul?” (3:20). Later,
he asks, “What strength do I have, that I should hope?” (6:11). And,
“Does it seem good to You that You should oppress?” (10:3). Many have
stood near a headstone placed too early and asked similar questions.

But when you read all the way to the end of the book, you get a
surprise. When God responds to Job (chs. 38–41), He does it in an
unexpected way. He turns the tables and asks Job questions—different
questions that show His wisdom and sovereignty. Questions about His
magnificent creation—the earth, stars, and sea. And the questions all
point to this: God is sovereign. God is all-powerful. God is love. And
God knows what He is doing.

Reflect & Pray

We comprehend Him not, Yet earth and heaven tell, God sits as
sovereign on the throne, And ruleth all things well. —Gerhardt

Our greatest comfort in sorrow is to know that God is in control.
