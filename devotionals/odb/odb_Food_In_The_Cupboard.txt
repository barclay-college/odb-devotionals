Food In The Cupboard

Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will
drink; nor about . . . what you will put on. —
Matthew 6:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:25-34

My friend Marcia, the director of the Jamaica Christian School for the
Deaf, recently illustrated an important way to look at things. In a
newsletter article she titled “A Blessed Start,” she pointed out that
for the first time in 7 years the school began the new year with a
surplus. And what was that surplus? A thousand dollars in the bank?
No. Enough school supplies for the year? No. It was simply this: A
month’s supply of food in the cupboard.

When you’re in charge of feeding 30 hungry kids on a shoestring
budget, that’s big! She accompanied her note with this verse from
1 Chronicles 16:34, “Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For
His mercy endures forever.”

Year after year Marcia trusts God to provide for the children and
staff at her school. She never has much—whether it’s water or food or
school supplies. Yet she is always grateful for what God sends, and
she is faithful to believe that He will continue to provide.

As we begin a new year, do we have faith in God’s provision? To do so
is to take our Savior at His word when He said, “Do not worry about
your life . . . . Do not worry about tomorrow” (Matt. 6:25,34).
