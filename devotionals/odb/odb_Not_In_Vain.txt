Not In Vain

Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move
you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you
know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
1 Corinthians 15:58

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 15:50–58

A financial advisor I know describes the reality of investing money by
saying, “Hope for the best and be prepared for the worst.” With almost
every decision we make in life there is uncertainty about the outcome.
Yet there is one course we can follow where no matter what happens, we
know that in the end it will not be a wasted effort.

The apostle Paul spent a year with the followers of Jesus in Corinth,
a city known for its moral corruption. After he left, he urged them in
a follow-up letter not to be discouraged or feel that their witness
for Christ was of no value. He assured them that a day is coming when
the Lord will return and even death will be swallowed up in victory (1
Cor. 15:52–55).

Remaining true to Jesus may be difficult, discouraging, and even
dangerous, but it is never pointless or wasted. As we walk with the
Lord and witness to His presence and power, our lives are not in vain!
We can be sure of that.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, in these days of uncertainty, we hold fast to Your promise that
our labor for You will accomplish Your purpose and be of great value
in Your eyes.

Our life and witness for Jesus Christ are not in vain.
