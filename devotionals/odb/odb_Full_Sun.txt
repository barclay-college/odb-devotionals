Full Sun

Live as children of light.
Ephesians 5:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 5:1-16

I know better, but I still keep trying. The instructions on the label
are clear: “Needs full sun.” Our yard has mostly shade. It is not
suitable for plants that need full sun. But I like the plant. I like
its color, the shape of the leaves, the size, the scent. So I buy it,
bring it home, plant it, and take really good care of it. But the
plant is not happy at my house. My care and attention are not enough.
It needs sunlight, which I cannot provide. I thought I could make up
for lack of light by giving the plant some other kind of attention.
But it doesn’t work that way. Plants need what they need.

And so do people. Although we can survive for a while in less-than-
ideal conditions, we can’t thrive. In addition to our basic physical
needs, we also have spiritual needs that can’t be met by any
substitute.

Scripture says that believers are children of light. This means that
we need to live in the full light of God’s presence to thrive (Ps.
89:15). If we try to live in darkness, we will produce nothing but
“fruitless deeds” (see Eph. 5:3-4, 11). But if we are living in the
light of Jesus, the Light of the world, we will produce the fruit of
His light, which is good, faithful, and true.
