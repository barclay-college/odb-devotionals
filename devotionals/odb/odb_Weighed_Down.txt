Weighed Down

Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares
us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. —
Hebrews 12:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 12:1-5

August 10, 1628, was a dark day in naval history. On that day the
royal warship Vasa set out on her maiden voyage. After taking 2 years
to build, being lavishly decorated and holding 64 cannons, the pride
of the Swedish navy sank only one mile out to sea. What went wrong?
The excessive load was too heavy to make her seaworthy. Excess weight
pulled the Vasa to the bottom of the ocean.

The Christian life can also be weighed down by excess baggage.
Encouraging us in our spiritual journey, the book of Hebrews says:
“Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares
us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith” (12:1-2).

Like the lavishly decorated ship, we may project to others an
impressive exterior. But if on the inside we are weighed down with
sin, our perseverance can be impaired. There is a remedy, however. By
relying on God’s guidance and the empowering of the Holy Spirit, our
load can be lightened and our perseverance buoyant.

Forgiveness and grace are always available to the spiritual traveler.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, too often I try to mask the burden and weight of sin
in my life with the outward activities of the Christian life. Forgive
me. Help me to set aside the things that keep me from running a good
race.

Perseverance is as much about a strong won’t as a strong will.
