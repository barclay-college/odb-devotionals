Acts Of Gratitude

What does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy, and
to walk humbly with your God? —
Micah 6:8

Today's Scripture: Micah 6:1-8

Few people knew me better as a boy than Francis Allen, the pastor who
led me to Jesus Christ. A fire-and-brimstone preacher in the pulpit,
he was a near-perfect example of the gentleness of God’s love outside
of it.

Early on, Francis recognized a tendency in me to try to “buy” approval
by working harder than expected and doing more than people asked.
“These are good traits to give as gifts to others,” he would tell me,
“but you should never use them to buy acceptance and love from
people—or from God.”

To help me understand this, he told me to read Jesus’ promise in
Matthew 11:30 that His “yoke is easy”—a statement that sometimes seems
too simple to be true. Then, pointing to Micah 6:6-8, he said: “Now
read this and ask yourself if there are any gifts you can give God
that He doesn’t already have.” The answer, of course, is no.

Then he went on to explain that God cannot be bought—the gift of grace
is free. Since this is true, what should be our response? “To do
justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God” (v.8). I
learned that these were acts of gratitude—not of purchase.

Let Micah 6 be a reminder that grace is free and that faithful living
is our grateful response.

Reflect & Pray

We’re saved by grace through faith alone, Good works can have no part;
But God rewards each loving deed That’s done with all our heart. —D.
De Haan

Good works are not the means of salvation but the result.
