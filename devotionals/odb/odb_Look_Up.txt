Look Up!

My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. —
Psalm 121:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 121

In a park near our home there’s a trail I enjoy walking on. Along one
section there’s a panoramic view of red sandstone rocks in the Garden
of the Gods with the majestic 14,115-foot Pikes Peak behind them. From
time to time, though, I find myself walking that section occupied with
some problem and looking down at the wide, smooth trail. If no one is
around, I may stop and say aloud, “David, look up!”

The psalms known as “Songs of Ascents” (Ps. 120–134) were sung by the
people of Israel as they walked the road up to Jerusalem to attend the
three annual pilgrim festivals. Psalm 121 begins, “I will lift up my
eyes to the hills. From whence comes my help?” (v. 1). The answer
follows, “My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth” (v.
2). The Creator is not an aloof being, but a companion who is always
with us, always awake to our circumstances (vv. 3-7), guiding and
guarding our journey through life “from this time forth, and even
forevermore” (v. 8).

Along life’s path, how we need to keep our eyes fixed on God, our
source of help. When we’re feeling overwhelmed and discouraged, it’s
all right to say aloud, “Look up!”
