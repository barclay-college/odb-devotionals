Knowing God’s Will

. . . that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect
will of God. —
Romans 12:2

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 5:17-21

A young man facing the future and unsure of what the next year would
bring, concluded, “Nobody knows what God’s will is.” Is he right? Does
a lack of certainty about the future translate into not knowing God’s
will?

The concept of knowing God’s will is often limited to discerning what
specific situation we will be in at some future time. Although seeking
God’s specific leading is part of it, another aspect that is just as
vital is to follow the clearly defined elements of God’s will each and
every day.

For instance, it is God’s will for us to be good citizens as a
challenge to those opposed to Christ (1 Peter 2:15), to give God
thanks no matter what (1 Thess. 5:18), to be sanctified sexually,
avoiding immorality (1 Thess. 4:3), to live under the Holy Spirit’s
control (Eph. 5:18), to sing to Him (v.19), and to submit to other
believers (v.21).

As we submit to God in these and other areas, we are more likely to
live in what Romans 12:2 calls God’s “good and acceptable and perfect
will.” Living with God’s smile of approval leads to His guidance for
the future.

As we seek to know God’s will for the future, we must also act on what
we already know now.
