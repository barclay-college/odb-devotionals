As White As Snow

Your sins . . . shall be as white as snow. —
Isaiah 1:18

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 1:1-4,12-18

Iwas driving my son home from school one day when snow began to fall.
The cottony fluff came down steadily and quickly. Eventually, we
slowed to a stop, boxed in by traffic. From inside our vehicle, we
watched a transformation take place. Dark patches of soil turned
white. Snow softened the sharp outlines of buildings; it coated the
cars around us, and accumulated on every tree in sight.

That snowfall reminded me of a spiritual truth: Just as that snow
covered everything in sight, God’s grace covers our sin. But grace
doesn’t just cover sin, grace erases sin. Through the prophet Isaiah,
God appealed to the Israelites, saying, “Come now, and let us reason
together . . . though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as
white as snow” (Isa. 1:18). When God made this promise, His children
had a painful problem with sin. God compared them to a physical body
plagued with “wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or
bandaged or soothed with oil” (v.6 niv).

As bad as their sin was, God was willing to extend His grace to them.
As His children today, we have the same assurance. Sin may stain our
lives, but when we repent and confess it, we have “the forgiveness of
sins, according to the riches of [God’s] grace” (Eph. 1:7).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give me courage to confess, To bare my sinful heart to Thee;
Forgiving love You long to show And from my sin to set me free. —D.

The weight of sin is balanced only by the blood of Christ.
