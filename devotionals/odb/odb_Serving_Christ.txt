Serving Christ

Obey [your earthly masters] . . . as slaves of Christ, doing the will
of God from your heart.
Ephesians 6:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 6:5–9

“I’m a secretary,” a friend told me. “When I tell people this, they
sometimes look at me with a certain pity. But when they find out who I
am secretary for, they open their eyes with admiration!” In other
words, society often defines some jobs as less important than others,
unless those jobs happen to relate in some way to rich or famous
people.

For the child of God, however, any occupation, regardless of the
earthly boss, can be held proudly because we serve the Lord Jesus.

In Ephesians 6, Paul talks to servants and masters. He reminds both
groups that we serve one Master who is in heaven. So we need to do
everything with sincerity of heart, integrity, and respect because we
are serving and working for Christ Himself. As the apostle Paul
reminds us, “Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord,
not people” (Eph. 6:7).

What a privilege to serve God in everything we do, whether answering a
phone or driving a car or doing housework or running a business. Let
us work with a smile today, remembering that no matter what we are
doing, we are serving God.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, I want to serve You in everything I do. Help me, as I
begin each day, to remember this.

Serving shows our love for God.
