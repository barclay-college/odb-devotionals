Hawks And Lions

The devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
—
1 Peter 5:8

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 5:5-11

One morning, I watched a rabbit nibble grass in my backyard. He was on
the small side, with brown flecked fur and a cotton-puff tail.
Suddenly, a hawk sliced through the air as fast and precise as
lightning. With talons outstretched, he snatched for his prey. But the
rabbit recognized the approaching danger and sped to safety, just
inches ahead of the hawk.

Like the rabbit that spotted its predator and scurried away, we as
Christians need to be watchful so that we can evade our enemy. “The
devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour”
(1 Peter 5:8). Satan wants to devour us by winning us over to his
ways; he does this by toying with the truth (John 8:44) and trying to
deceive us (Gen. 3:1).

The devil’s schemes reflect his dishonest nature, and his tricks are
meant to catch us off guard. In response, Christians should be alert
and clear-headed (1 Peter 5:8). Living in this state of active
readiness helps us discern false teaching (1 John 4:1-3; 2 John
1:7-11) and overcome temptation (Matt. 26:41).

Today, watch out for your spiritual predator. What kind of lies is he
whispering? How is he tempting you? Resist him, and he will flee
(James 4:7).

Reflect & Pray

The devil is cunning, deceptive, and sly; He’s clever; he tricks us to
swallow his lie. But his crafty methods we’re sure to discern If we
make God’s warnings our daily concern. —D. De Haan

The first step on the way to victory is to recognize the enemy.
