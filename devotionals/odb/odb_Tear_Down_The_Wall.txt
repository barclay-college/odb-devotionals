Tear Down The Wall

He comforted them and spoke kindly to them. —
Genesis 50:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 50:15-21

The years following World War II were labeled the Cold War as nations
exchanged threats and jockeyed for power. The Berlin Wall, built in
August 1961, stood for almost 3 decades as one of the most powerful
symbols of the smoldering animosity. Then, on November 9, 1989, it was
announced that citizens could cross freely from East to West Berlin.
The entire wall was demolished the following year.

The familiar Old Testament story of Joseph follows a favorite son
whose brothers hated him (Gen. 37–50). Yet Joseph refused to build a
wall of hatred between himself and his brothers who sold him into
slavery. When a famine brought them face to face after many years,
Joseph treated his brothers with kindness, saying, “You meant evil
against me; but God meant it for good . . . . And he comforted them
and spoke kindly to them” (50:20-21), helping to restore the
relationship between them.

Twenty-five years ago today, an oppressive man-made barrier was
opened, offering freedom and reuniting families and friends.

If we’ve built walls of anger and separation between ourselves and
others, the Lord is willing and able to help us begin tearing them
down today.

By:  David C. McCasland

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, examine my heart; reveal to me where I have erected
walls in relationships. Show me the way to start tearing them down
that there might be reconciliation.

Anger builds walls; love breaks them down.
