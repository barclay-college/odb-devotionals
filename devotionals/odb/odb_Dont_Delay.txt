Don’t Delay

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that
whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
John 3:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 9:57-62

For many years I spoke to my distant cousin about our need of a
Savior. When he visited me recently and I once again urged him to
receive Christ, his immediate response was: “I would like to accept
Jesus and join the church, but not yet. I live among people of other
faiths. Unless I relocate, I will not be able to practice my faith
well.” He cited persecution, ridicule, and pressure from his peers as
excuses to postpone his decision.

His fears were legitimate, but I assured him that whatever happened,
God would not abandon him. I encouraged my cousin not to delay but to
trust God for care and protection. He gave up his defenses,
acknowledged his need of Christ’s forgiveness, and trusted Him as his
personal Savior.

When Jesus invited people to follow Him, they too offered excuses—all
about being busy with the cares of this world (Luke 9:59-62). The
Lord’s answer to them (vv. 60-62) urges us not to let excuses deprive
us of the most important thing in life: the salvation of our souls.

Do you hear God calling you to commit your life to Him? Do not delay.
“Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation”

Come to the Savior, make no delay—here in His Word He’s shown us the
way; here in our midst He’s standing today, tenderly saying, “Come!”
