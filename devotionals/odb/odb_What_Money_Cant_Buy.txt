What Money Can’t Buy

In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of His grace. —
Ephesians 1:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 1:3-14

“There are some things money can’t buy—but these days, not many”
according to Michael Sandel, author of What Money Can’t Buy. A person
can buy a prison-cell upgrade for $90 a night, the right to shoot an
endangered black rhino for $250,000, and your doctor’s cell phone
number for $1,500. It seems that “almost everything is up for sale.”

But one thing money can’t buy is redemption—freedom from the
stranglehold of sin. When the apostle Paul began writing about the
rich nature of God’s plan of salvation through Jesus, his heart
erupted in praise: “In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace which He
made to abound toward us” (Eph. 1:7-8).

Jesus’ death on the cross was the high cost of delivering us from sin.
And only He could pay that price because He was the perfect Son of
God. The natural response to such free but costly grace is spontaneous
praise from our hearts and commitment to the God who bought us through
Jesus (1:13-14).

Praise to our loving God—He has come to set us free!

Reflect & Pray

What amazing love You have for us, heavenly Father! That You gave Your
Son who willingly died in our place. It seems too good to be true.
Thank You!

Only Jesus’ death could purchase our freedom.
