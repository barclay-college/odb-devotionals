God’s Sandpaper

As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.
Proverbs 27:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 27:5–17

My friend’s words stung. Trying to sleep, I battled to stop mulling
over her pointed comments about my strong opinions. As I lay there, I
asked for God’s wisdom and peace. Several weeks later, still concerned
about the matter, I prayed, “I hurt, Lord, but show me where I need to
change. Show me where she’s right.”

My friend had acted as God’s sandpaper in my life. My feelings felt
rubbed raw, but I sensed that how I responded would lead to the
building of my character—or not. My choice was to submit to the
smoothing process, confessing my pride and stubborn stance. I sensed
that my bumps and imperfections didn’t glorify the Lord.

King Solomon knew that life in community could be difficult, a theme
he addressed in the book of Proverbs. In chapter 27, we see his wisdom
applied to relationships. He likens the sharp words between friends as
iron sharpening iron: “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens
another” (v. 17), shaving off the rough edges in each other’s
behavior. The process may bring about wounds, such as the hurt I felt
from my friend’s words (see v. 6), but ultimately the Lord can use
these words to help and encourage us to make needed changes in our
attitude and behavior.

How might the Lord be smoothing out your rough edges for His glory?

Reflect & Pray

Lord, this shaping process hurts, but I want to submit to the process.
Mold me and smooth me.

The Lord allows our rough edges to be smoothed over through the
sandpaper of life.
