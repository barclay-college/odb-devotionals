Making Preparations

If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to
be with me that you also may be where I am.
John 14:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:1–6

As we viewed my father-in-law’s body in his casket at the funeral
home, one of his sons took his dad’s hammer and tucked it alongside
his folded hands. Years later, when my mother-in-law died, one of the
children slipped a set of knitting needles under her fingers. Those
sweet gestures brought comfort to us as we remembered how often they
had used those tools during their lives.

Of course, we knew that they wouldn’t actually need those items in
eternity. We had no illusions, as the ancient Egyptians did, that
tools or money or weapons buried with someone would better prepare
them for the next life. You can’t take it with you! (Ps. 49:16–17; 1
Tim. 6:7).

But some preparation for eternity had been necessary for my in-laws.
That preparation had come years before when they trusted Jesus as
their Savior.

Planning for the life to come can’t begin at the time of our death.
Each of us prepares our heart by accepting the gift of salvation made
possible by Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross.

At the same time, God has made preparations as well: “If I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me
that you also may be where I am” (John 14:3). He has promised to
prepare a place for us to spend eternity with Him.
