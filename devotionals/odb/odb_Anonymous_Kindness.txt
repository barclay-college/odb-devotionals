Anonymous Kindness

When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your
right hand is doing.
Matthew 6:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:1–4

When I first graduated from college, I found myself needing to adopt a
strict grocery budget—twenty-five dollars a week, to be exact. One
day, while entering the checkout line, I suspected the groceries I’d
selected cost slightly more than my remaining money. “Just stop when
we reach twenty dollars,” I told the cashier, and I was able to
purchase everything I’d selected but a bag of peppers.

As I was about to drive home, a man stopped by my car. “Here’s your
peppers, ma’am,” he said, handing the bag to me. Before I had time to
thank him, he was already walking away.

Remembering the simple goodness of this act of kindness still warms my
heart and brings to mind Jesus’s words in Matthew 6. Criticizing those
who made a show of giving to the needy (v. 2), Jesus taught His
disciples a different way. Instead of making giving all about them and
their generosity, He urged that giving should be done so secretly it’s
like their left hand isn’t even aware their right is giving (v. 3)!

As one person’s anonymous kindness reminded me, giving should never be
about us. We give only because of what our generous God has so
lavishly given us (2 Corinthians 9:6–11). As we give quietly and
generously, we reflect who He is—and God receives the thanksgiving
only He deserves (v. 11).
