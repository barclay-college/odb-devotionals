Golden Eagle

I will meditate . . . on Your wondrous works. —
Psalm 145:5

Today's Scripture: Psalm 145:1-7

My son Mark and I were leaving the Clyde Peterson Ranch in Wyoming to
head back to Michigan. In the distance we spotted a huge bird sitting
in a solitary tree overlooking a steep canyon. As we approached, the
golden eagle leaped from the tree and soared out over the canyon, the
golden streaks in its feathers shimmering in the morning sun. Its
immense size and beauty filled us with wonder. We felt privileged to
witness this magnificent demonstration of God’s awesome creativity.

Creation displays God’s “wondrous works” (Ps. 145:5). And when we stop
to meditate on those works, we can’t help but be awed as our minds and
spirits are moved to reflect on the character of the God who created
them.

That golden eagle told my son and me a story of the creative genius of
our mighty God. So does the flitting songbird, the doe with her
playful fawn, the pounding surf, and delicate little flowers such as
bachelor’s-button and spring beauty. In the most unexpected moments
and out-of-the-way places the Lord shines His glory in this world in
order to reveal Himself to us. Those serendipitous moments are
opportunities to “meditate . . . on [His] wondrous works” (v.5).
