Is God There?

I will wait for the Lord . . . . I will put my trust in him.
Isaiah 8:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 8:16–18

Lela was dying of cancer, and her husband, Timothy, couldn’t
understand why a loving God would let his wife suffer. She had served
Him faithfully as a Bible teacher and mentor to many. “Why did You let
this happen?” he cried. Yet Timothy continued to be faithful in his
walk with God.

“So why do you still believe in God?” I asked him frankly. “What keeps
you from turning away from Him?”

“Because of what has happened before,” Timothy replied. While he
couldn’t “see” God now, he recalled the times when God had helped and
protected him. These were signs that God was still there caring for
his family. “I know the God I believe in will come through in His own
way,” he said.

Timothy’s words echo Isaiah’s expression of trust in Isaiah 8:17. Even
when he couldn’t feel God’s presence as his people braced for trouble
from their enemies, he would “wait for the Lord .” He trusted in God
because of the signs He’d given of His continuing presence (v. 18).

There are times when we might feel as if God isn’t with us in our
troubles. That’s when we depend on what we can see of His works in our
lives, in the past and present. They’re the visible reminder of an
invisible God—a God who is always with us and will answer in His own
time and way.

Reflect & Pray

What signs can you see of God working in your life? How can they
remind you that you can still look to Him for hope and comfort?

Father, thank You for always being there for me. Give me the strength
to trust in You even when I don’t understand what’s going on.
