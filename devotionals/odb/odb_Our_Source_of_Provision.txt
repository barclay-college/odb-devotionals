Our Source of Provision

The Lord is near to all who call on him.
Psalm 145:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:9–15

In August 2010, the attention of the world was focused on a mine shaft
near Copiapó, Chile. Thirty-three miners huddled in the dark, trapped
2,300 feet underground. They had no idea if help would ever arrive.
After seventeen days of waiting, they heard drilling. Rescuers
produced a small hole in the mine shaft ceiling, and that hole was
followed by three more, establishing a delivery path for water, food,
and medicine. The miners depended on those conduits to the surface
above ground, where rescuers had the provisions they would need to
survive. On day sixty-nine, rescuers pulled the last miner to safety.

None of us can survive in this world apart from provisions that are
outside of ourselves. God, the Creator of the universe, is the one who
provides us with everything we need. Like the drill holes for those
miners, prayer connects us to the God of all supply.

Jesus encouraged us to pray, “Give us today our daily bread” (Matt.
6:11). In His day, bread was the basic staple of life and pictured all
the daily needs of the people. Jesus was teaching us to pray not only
for our physical needs but also for everything we need—comfort,
healing, courage, wisdom.

Through prayer we have access to Him at any moment, and He knows what
we need before we even ask (v. 8). What might you be struggling with
today? “The Lord is near to all who call on him” (Ps. 145:18).
