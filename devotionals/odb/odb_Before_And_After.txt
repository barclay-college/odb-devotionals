Before And After

Give ear to my prayer, O God . . . . My heart is severely pained
within me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me. —
Psalm 55:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 55:1-8,16-17

What changes take place in a life of faith after severe testing? I
thought of this as I read the tragic story of a Jamaican dad who
accidentally shot and killed his 18-year-old daughter while trying to
protect his family from intruders.

News reports said he went to church (as was his habit) the next
day—distraught but still seeking God’s help. Faith in God guided him
before, and he knew God could sustain him after.

I thought about this in regard to my own life—having also lost a
teenage daughter. To review how I viewed life and faith before
Melissa’s death, I dug into my computer archives to read the last
article I had written before we lost her in June 2002. How would what
I said then correspond to what I know now? Had severe testing changed
my view of faith in God? In May of that year, I had written this:
“David was not afraid to go boldly to God and tell Him what was on his
heart. . . . We don’t have to be afraid to tell God what is on our
heart.”

Before I went through tough times, I went to God and He listened to
me. After, I discovered that He still listens and comforts and
sustains. So I continue to pray in faith. Our faith remains intact and
is strengthened because He is the God of the before and the after.

Reflect & Pray

God is still on the throne, He never forsaketh His own; His promise is
true, He will not forget you, God is still on the throne. — Suffield

What we know of God encourages us to trust Him in all we do not know.
