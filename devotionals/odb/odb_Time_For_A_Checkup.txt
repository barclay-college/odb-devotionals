Time For A Checkup

Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink
of the cup. —
1 Corinthians 11:28

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 11:27-29

Every year I have a physical—that periodic visit to the doctor’s
office where I’m poked and prodded, screened and studied. It is
something that can be easy to dread, and even to fear. We aren’t sure
what the tests will show or what the doctors will say. Still, we know
that we need this evaluation to understand our physical well-being and
what is needed as we move forward.

The same is true spiritually in the life of the Christ-follower. We
need to pause from time to time and reflect on the condition of our
hearts and lives.

One place for an important self-study is at the Lord’s Table. Paul
wrote to the Corinthians, some of whom were eating in an unworthy
manner: “Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread
and drink of the cup” (1 Cor. 11:28). In the remembrance of Christ’s
death for us, there can be a sobering clarity of thought and
understanding, for as we consider the price Jesus paid for us, it is
the best time to consider the condition of our heart and our
relationships. Then, with honest understanding of our spiritual well-
being, we can turn to Him for the grace we need to move forward in His
name.

Is it time for your checkup?

Reflect & Pray

Search me, O God, my heart discern; Try me, my inmost thoughts to
learn. Help me to keep from sin, I pray, Guarding my mind throughout
this day. —Anon.

Self-examination is one test from which no Christian is excused.
