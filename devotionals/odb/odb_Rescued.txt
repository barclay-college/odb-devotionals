Rescued

Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved. —
Acts 16:31

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, 20-25

Manuel Gonzalez was the first rescue worker to reach the 33 miners
trapped for 69 days in a Chilean mine explosion in 2010. At great risk
to his own life, he went underground more than 2,000 feet to bring the
trapped men back to the surface. The world watched in amazement as one
by one each miner was rescued and transported to freedom.

The Bible tells us of an even more amazing rescue. Because of Adam and
Eve’s disobedience, all of mankind is trapped in sin (Gen. 2:17;
3:6,19; Rom. 5:12). Unable to break free, everyone faces certain
death—physically and eternally. But God has provided a Rescuer—Jesus
Christ, the Son of God. Everyone who accepts the free gift of
salvation offered through His death and resurrection is freed from
sin’s grip and its resulting death penalty (Rom. 5:8-11; 10:9-11; Eph.
2:1-10).

Jesus Christ is the “firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1
Cor. 15:20). He was the first to be raised from the dead, never to die
again. Likewise, all will be given life who put their faith in Christ
(Rom. 8:11).

Are you still trapped in your sins? Accept Jesus’ gift of salvation
and enjoy the freedom of life in Christ and eternity with Him (Acts
16:31; Eph. 2:1; Col. 2:13).

Reflect & Pray

Thinking It Over What keeps you from calling out to God for spiritual
rescue? Do you fear that you are too bad for God’s grace? Read and
think about Romans 3:23-26.

Through His cross, Jesus rescues and redeems.
