Our Source Of Help

My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. —
Psalm 121:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 121

Twenty-year-old Lygon Stevens, an experienced mountaineer, had reached
the summits of Mt. McKinley, Mt. Rainier, four Andean peaks in
Ecuador, and 39 of Colorado’s highest mountains. “I climb because I
love the mountains,” she said, “and I meet God there.” In January
2008, Lygon died in an avalanche while climbing Little Bear Peak in
southern Colorado with her brother Nicklis, who survived.

When her parents discovered her journals, they were deeply moved by
the intimacy of her walk with Christ. “Always a shining light for
Him,” her mother said, “Lygon experienced a depth and honesty in her
relationship with the Lord, which even seasoned veterans of faith long
to have.”

In Lygon’s final journal entry, written from her tent 3 days before
the avalanche, she said: “God is good, and He has a plan for our lives
that is greater and more blessed than the lives we pick out for
ourselves, and I am so thankful about that. Thank You, Lord, for
bringing me this far and to this place. I leave the rest—my future—in
those same hands and say thank You.”

Lygon echoed these words from the psalmist: “My help comes from the
Lord, who made heaven and earth” (Ps. 121:2).
