Consider The Lilies

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His
handiwork. —
Psalm 19:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 19:1-6

I enjoy nature and giving praise to its Creator, but I sometimes
wrongly feel guilty for admiring it too much. Then I remember that
Jesus used nature as a teaching tool. To encourage people not to
worry, He used simple wildflowers as an example. “Consider the
lilies,” He said, and then reminded people that even though flowers do
no work at all, God dresses them in splendor. His conclusion? If God
clothes something temporary in such glory, He surely will do much more
for us (Matt. 6:28-34).

Other portions of Scripture indicate that creation is one of the ways
God uses to tell us about Himself:

“The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His
handiwork,” wrote David. “Day unto day utters speech, and night unto
night reveals knowledge” (Ps. 19:1-2).

“Let the heavens declare His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge,”
Asaph said (50:6).

And Paul wrote, “For since the creation of the world His invisible
attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without
excuse” (Rom. 1:20).

God so loves us and wants us to know Him that He put evidence of
Himself everywhere we look.

Reflect & Pray

Father, Your love is overwhelmingly evident, yet so often we miss it.
Thank You for the unfailing reminders of Your grace, love, and mercy.
Give us eyes to see Your beauty in Your creation.

In God’s pattern book of nature we can trace many valuable lessons.
