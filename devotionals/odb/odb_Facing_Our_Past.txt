Facing Our Past

He tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and
did not believe that he was a disciple. —
Acts 9:26

Today's Scripture: Acts 9:20-30

Chuck Colson, founder of Prison Fellowship, spent 40 years helping
people hear and understand the gospel of Jesus Christ. When he died in
April 2012, one newspaper article carried the headline, “Charles
Colson, Nixon’s ‘dirty tricks’ man, dies at 80.” It seemed surprising
that a man so transformed by faith should be identified with things he
did as a politically ruthless presidential aide decades earlier before
he knew the Savior.

The apostle Paul’s conversion and his early Christian witness were
greeted with skepticism and fear. When he began preaching that Jesus
is the Son of God, people said, “Is this not he who destroyed those
who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that
purpose?” (Acts 9:21). Later when Paul went to Jerusalem and tried to
join the disciples, they were afraid of him (v.26). In years to come,
Paul never ignored his past, but spoke of it as evidence of the mercy
of God (1 Tim. 1:13-14).

Like Paul, we don’t need to parade our failures or to pretend they
didn’t happen. Instead, we can thank the Lord that through His grace
and power, our past is forgiven, our present is changed, and our
future is bright with hope for all He has prepared for us.
