Our Best Friend

12 Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name,
he gave the right to become children of God
John 1:12

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 10:19–23

When I was twelve years old our family moved to a town in the desert.
After gym classes in the hot air at my new school, we rushed for the
drinking fountain. Being skinny and young for my grade, I sometimes
got pushed out of the way while waiting in line. One day my friend
Jose, who was big and strong for his age, saw this happening. He
stepped in and stuck out a strong arm to clear my way. “Hey!” he
exclaimed, “You let Banks get a drink first!” I never had trouble at
the drinking fountain again.

Jesus understood what it was like to face the ultimate unkindness of
others. The Bible tells us, “He was despised and rejected by mankind”
(Isa. 53:3). But Jesus was not just a victim, He also became our
advocate. By giving His life, Jesus opened a “new and living way” for
us to enter into a relationship with God (Heb. 10:20). He did for us
what we could never do for ourselves, offering us the free gift of
salvation when we repent of our sins and trust in Him.

Jesus is the best friend we could ever have. He said, “Whoever comes
to me I will never drive away” (John 6:37). Others may hold us at
arm’s length or even push us away, but God has opened His arms to us
through the cross. How strong is our Savior!

Reflect & Pray

Love’s redeeming work is done, fought the fight, the battle won. Death
in vain forbids him rise; Christ has opened paradise. Charles Wesley

God’s free gift to us cost Him dearly.
