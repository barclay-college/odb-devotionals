East Meets West

Who are you to judge someone else’s servant?
Romans 14:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 14:1–12

When students from Southeast Asia met a teacher from North America,
the visiting instructor learned a lesson. After giving his class their
first multiple-choice test, he was surprised to find many questions
left unanswered. While handing back the corrected papers, he suggested
that, next time, instead of leaving answers blank they should take a
guess. Surprised, one of the students raised their hand and asked,
“What if I accidentally get the answer right? I would be implying that
I knew the answer when I didn’t.” The student and teacher had a
different perspective and practice.

In the days of the New Testament, Jewish and Gentile converts were
coming to Christ with perspectives as different as East and West.
Before long they were disagreeing over matters as diverse as worship
days and what a Christ-follower is free to eat or drink. The apostle
Paul urged them to remember an important fact: None of us is in a
position to know or judge the heart of another.

For the sake of harmony with fellow believers, God urges us to realize
that we are all accountable to our Lord, to act according to His Word
and our conscience. However, He alone is in a position to judge the
attitudes of our heart (Rom. 14:4–7).

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, please have mercy on us for presuming to judge the
heart of those who see so many things differently than we do.

Be slow to judge others but quick to judge yourself.
