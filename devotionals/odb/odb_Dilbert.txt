Dilbert

. . . not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of
Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. —
Ephesians 6:6

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 6:1-6

Cartoonist Scott Adams has become famous for his humorous cartoon
strip “Dilbert.” He also wrote a book in the 1990s called The Dilbert
Principle. In it he mocks technology, leadership fads, and incompetent
managers. Many laugh out loud at the connections the book makes with
their own work-a-day world.

Regarding employee laziness and deceit, the author writes: “When it
comes to avoiding work, it is fair to say I studied with the masters.
After nine years . . . I learned just about everything there is to
know about looking busy without actually being busy.”

Believers, however, have a much higher calling when it comes to
dealing with employers. In the Scriptures, we are encouraged to
exhibit a respectful attitude toward those who supervise us:
“Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to
the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to
Christ; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of
Christ, doing the will of God from the heart” (Eph. 6:5-6).

The right work ethic begins with a heart of sincerity in which we
consider Jesus Christ our employer. We please Him when we diligently
serve our boss and others in the workplace.
