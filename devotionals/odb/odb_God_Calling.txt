God Calling

This is how God showed his love . . . : He sent his one and only Son
into the world.
1 John 4:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 3:1–10

One morning my daughter gave her eleven-month-old son her cell phone
for a moment to entertain him. Less than a minute later my phone rang,
and as I picked it up I heard his little voice. He had somehow hit the
“speed dial” to my number, and what followed was a “conversation” I
will long remember. My grandson can only say a few words, but he knows
my voice and responds to it. So I talked to him and told him how much
I love him.

The joy I felt at the sound of my grandson’s voice was a reminder to
me of God’s deep desire for a relationship with us. From the very
beginning, the Bible shows God actively pursuing us. After Adam and
Eve sinned by disobeying God and then hid from Him in the garden, “the
Lord God called” to Adam (Gen. 3:9).

God continued to pursue humanity through Jesus. Because God desires a
relationship with us, He sent Jesus to earth to pay the penalty for
our sin by His death on the cross. “This is how God showed his love .
. . . He sent his Son as a sacrifice to clear away our sins and the
damage they’ve done to our relationship with God” (1 John 4:9–10 The
Message).

How good it is to know that God loves us and wants us to respond to
His love through Jesus. Even when we don’t quite know what to say, our
Father longs to hear from us!
