Stand Or Go?

Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the
salvation of the Lord”—
Exodus 14:13

Today's Scripture: Exodus 14:5-22

The Israelites were trapped. Soon after leaving slavery and Egypt
behind, they looked up and saw a distressing sight. A cloud of dust
was moving their way, and in that dust was a massive army. Pharaoh’s
“disease” had returned—hardening of the heart (Ex. 14:8). As a result,
he sent his chariots after Moses and his people.

Once the Egyptian army caught up with the Israelites, all seemed lost.
They were trapped between a wall of soldiers and a sea of water. In
panic, they cried out to both Moses and God.

Both of them responded with instructions. Moses said, “Stand still,
and see the salvation of the Lord. ” (14:13). And God told them, “Go
forward” (v.15). While that may seem to be contradictory advice, both
commands were from God and right. First, the people had to “stand
still” or “firm” long enough to get instructions from God. What if
they had rushed headlong into the Red Sea without consulting the Lord?
But in standing still, they heard God’s instructions, which included
both what they were to do—move on, and what Moses was to do—stretch
out his hand over the sea in obedience and God would part the waters.

Do circumstances have you trapped? Stand still. Take time to consult
God and His Word. Then, using His instructions, move ahead and let God
guide you.

It matters not how dark the way, How thick the clouds from day to day,
God will direct in all we do If we take time to pray it through. —Mead
