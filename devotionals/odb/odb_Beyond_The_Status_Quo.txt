Beyond The Status Quo

But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life. —
John 5:40

Today's Scripture: John 5:35-47

Dr. Jack Mezirow, professor emeritus at Columbia Teachers College,
believes that an essential element in adult learning is to challenge
our own ingrained perceptions and examine our insights critically. Dr.
Mezirow says that adults learn best when faced with what he calls a
“disorienting dilemma”—something that “helps you critically reflect on
the assumptions you’ve acquired” (Barbara Strauch, The New York
Times). This is the opposite of saying, “My mind is made up—don’t
confuse me with the facts.”

When Jesus healed on the Sabbath, He challenged the deeply held
beliefs of many religious leaders, and they sought to silence Him
(John 5:16-18). Jesus said to them: “You search the Scriptures, for in
them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify
of Me. But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life”
(vv.39-40).

Oswald Chambers observed, “God has a way of bringing in facts which
upset a man’s doctrines if these stand in the way of God getting at
his soul.”

Unsettling experiences that cause us to question our assumptions about
the Lord can also lead us to a deeper understanding and trust in
Him—if we’re willing to think it through and come to Him.
