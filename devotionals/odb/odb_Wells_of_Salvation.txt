Wells of Salvation

With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
Isaiah 12:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 12

When people drill holes deep into the earth, it is normally for
pulling up core samples of rock, accessing oil, or finding water.

In Isaiah 12, we learn that God wanted His people, who were living in
a spiritual desert as well as a geographical desert, to discover His
“wells of salvation.” The prophet Isaiah compared God’s salvation to a
well from which the most refreshing of all waters can be drawn. After
many years of turning their back on God, the nation of Judah was
destined for exile as God allowed foreign invaders to conquer the
nation, scattering the people. Yet, said the prophet Isaiah, a remnant
would eventually return to their homeland as a sign that God was with
them (Isa. 11:11-12).

Isaiah 12 is a hymn, praising God for His faithfulness in keeping His
promises, especially the promise of salvation. Isaiah encouraged the
people that deep in God’s “wells of salvation” they would experience
the cool water of God’s grace, strength, and joy (vv. 1-3). This would
refresh and strengthen their hearts and cause praise and gratitude to
God (vv. 4-6).

God wants each of us to discover through confession and repentance the
deep, cool waters of joy found in the everlasting well of His
salvation.
