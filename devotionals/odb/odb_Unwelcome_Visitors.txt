Unwelcome Visitors

My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. —
James 1:2-3

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 1:2-12

Recently my wife, Marlene, and I received a panicky phone call from
our son and his wife. The night before, they had found two bats in
their house. I know bats are an important part of the ecosystem, but
they are not my favorite among God’s creatures, especially when they
are flying around inside.

Yet Marlene and I were thankful we could go over to our kids’ house
and help. We helped them to plug the holes that might have been used
by these unwelcome visitors to enter their house.

Another unwelcome visitor that often intrudes into our lives is
suffering. When trials come, we can easily panic or lose heart. But
these difficult circumstances can become the instruments our loving
heavenly Father uses to make us more like Christ. That’s why James
wrote, “My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various
trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But
let patience have its perfect work” (James 1:2-4).

We are not expected to enjoy trials or to celebrate suffering. But
when these unwelcome visitors arrive, we can look for God’s hand in
them and trust that He can use them to make us more like His Son.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, that You give to us each day what You know is best.
We’re thankful that we can trust Your heart, which is kind beyond all
measure.

Trials may visit us, but our God is always with us.
