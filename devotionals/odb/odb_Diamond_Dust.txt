Diamond Dust

Wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
Psalm 51:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 1:18-20; Psalm 51:7

During a bitterly frigid winter in our part of Michigan, there were
many mixed emotions about the weather. As the snowy winter season
pressed on into March, most people had long before fallen out of love
with snow and were bemoaning long-range forecasts of low temperatures.

Yet the majestic beauty of the snow continued to amaze me. Even as I
threw endless shovelsful of it from my driveway onto the over-my-head
snowbanks, I was enthralled with the white stuff. One particular day,
ice crystals filtered down from the sky to fall atop old snow. As my
wife and I took a walk through this sparkling scene, it looked as if
diamond dust had been sprinkled across the landscape.

In Scripture, snow seems to have varied purposes. God sends it as an
indicator of His creative greatness (Job 37:6; 38:22-23). Snow-capped
mountains irrigate the arid valleys below. But more significantly, God
gives snow as a picture of our forgiveness. The gospel of Jesus
provides a way for us to be cleansed of our sins and for our hearts to
be made much “whiter than snow” (Ps. 51:7; Isa. 1:18).

The next time you see snow—in life or in photos—thank God for the
forgiveness and the freedom from sin’s penalties that this beautiful,
natural gift pictures for all who have put their trust in our Savior.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You for forgiving us and for turning our filthiness into the
beauty of forgiveness. Help us to display the beauty of our
forgiveness to all we encounter.

When Christ forgives us, our hearts are as clean as new-fallen snow.
