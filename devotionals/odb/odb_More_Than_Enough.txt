More Than Enough

[The Lord] crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies. —
Psalm 103:4

Today's Scripture: Psalm 103:1-11

When I entertained a large group in my home, I feared that the menu I
planned wouldn’t be enough to serve all the guests. I shouldn’t have
worried though. Several friends unexpectedly brought additional items
and all of us were able to enjoy the surprise surplus. We had more
than enough and were able to share out of the abundance.

We serve a God of abundance who is consistently “more than enough.” We
can see God’s generous nature in the way He loves His children.

In Psalm 103, David lists the many benefits our Father bestows on us.
Verse 4 says that He redeems our life from destruction and crowns us
with lovingkindness and tender mercies.

The apostle Paul reminds us that God “has blessed us with every
spiritual blessing” and “is able to do exceedingly abundantly above
all that we ask or think” (Eph. 1:3; 3:20).

Because of His great love, we are called children of God (1 John 3:1),
and His grace gives us “sufficiency in all things” that we “may have
an abundance for every good work” (2 Cor. 9:8).

God’s love and grace, spilled over into our lives, enables us to share
them with others. The God of power and provision is always the God of
“more than enough”!

Reflect & Pray

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven; To His feet your tribute bring.
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Evermore His praises sing. —Lyte

We always have enough when God is our supply.
