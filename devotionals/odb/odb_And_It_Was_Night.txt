“And It Was Night”

Having received the piece of bread, [Judas] then went out immediately.
And it was night. —
John 13:30

Today's Scripture: John 13:21-30

During a business trip to Philadelphia, I attended an evening service
on the Thursday before Easter—a service of Communion and Tenebrae
(darkness) held in a small chapel lit by candles. Following the bread
and the cup, a passage was read aloud from the gospel of John, one
candle was extinguished, and we sang a verse from a hymn about Jesus’
journey to the cross. This was repeated 14 times until the chapel was
completely dark. In silence we knelt in prayer and then left one by
one without speaking.

The darkness of this type of service can remind us of the dark
elements surrounding Jesus’ death. Think of His last meal with the
disciples (John 13:21-30) as He explained that one of them would
betray Him. Only Jesus knew it was Judas. “Having received the piece
of bread, [Judas] then went out immediately. And it was night” (v.30).

On the darkest evening of Jesus’ life, He agonized in prayer in the
Garden, faced a wrongful arrest, endured humiliation at the hands of
religious leaders, and winced at Peter’s denials. Yet He moved
faithfully toward the cross where He would die for our sins.

Jesus endured darkness and death to give us light and life. Praise Him
for what He went through for us!

Reflect & Pray

See, from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love flow mingled
down; Did e’er such love and sorrow meet, Or thorns compose so rich a
crown? —Watts

Calvary reveals the vileness of our sin and the vastness of God’s
love.
