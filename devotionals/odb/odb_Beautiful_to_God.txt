Beautiful to God

What is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you
care for them?
Psalm 8:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 8:4–9

When Denise began dating her boyfriend, she attempted to maintain a
slim figure and dress stylishly, believing she would be more
attractive to him in that way. After all, it was what all the women’s
magazines advised. It was only much later that she discovered what he
really thought: “I liked you just as much when you were heavier and
didn’t worry about what you wore.”

Denise realized then how subjective “beauty” was. Our view of beauty
is so easily influenced by others. It’s often focused on the external,
forgetting the value of inner beauty. But God sees us in only one
way—as His beautiful, beloved children. I’d like to think that when
God created the world, He left the best for last—us! Everything He
created was good, but we’re extra special because we’re made in the
image of God (Genesis 1:27).

God considers us beautiful! No wonder the psalmist was filled with awe
as he compared the greatness of nature with humans. “What is mankind,”
he asked, “that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care
for them?” (Psalm 8:4). Yet God chose to give mortals a glory and
honor that nothing else had (v. 5).

This truth gives us an assurance and reason to praise Him (v. 9). No
matter what others think of us—or what we think of ourselves—know
this: We are beautiful to God.

Reflect & Pray

How do you see yourself? How do you think God sees you?

Father, You know how insecure we can feel about ourselves. Thank You
for the assurance that You love us!
