The Catcher

If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you
to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. —
John 14:3

Today's Scripture: John 14:1-6

Life is a risky enterprise. Sometimes we fly high, enjoying great
success. But then suddenly we fall into deep disappointments and the
haunting reality of failure, leaving our hearts wondering if there is
anything worth looking forward to.

At a funeral recently, the pastor told the story about a trapeze
artist. The performer admitted that although he is seen as the star of
the show, the real star is the catcher—the teammate who hangs from
another trapeze bar to grab him and guarantee a safe landing. The key,
he explained, is trust. With outstretched arms, the flyer must trust
that the catcher is ready and able to grab him. Dying is like trusting
in God as the catcher. After we have flown through life, we can look
forward to God reaching out to catch His followers and to pull us
safely to Himself forever. I like that thought.

This reminds me of Jesus’ comforting words to His disciples: “Let not
your heart be troubled . . . . I go to prepare a place for you. And .
. . I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am,
there you may be also” (John 14:1-3).

Life is indeed a risky business, but be encouraged! If you have put
your faith in Jesus Christ, the Catcher is waiting at the end to take
you safely home.
