Heavenly Perspective

The things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not
seen are eternal. —
2 Corinthians 4:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 4:16-18

Fanny Crosby lost her sight as an infant. Yet, amazingly, she went on
to become one of the most well-known lyricists of Christian hymns.
During her long life, she wrote over 9,000 hymns. Among them are such
enduring favorites as “Blessed Assurance” and “To God Be the Glory.”

Some people felt sorry for Fanny. A well-intentioned preacher told
her, “I think it is a great pity that the Master did not give you
sight when He showered so many other gifts upon you.” It sounds hard
to believe, but she replied: “Do you know that if at birth I had been
able to make one petition, it would have been that I was born blind? .
. . Because when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever
gladden my sight will be that of my Savior.”

Fanny saw life with an eternal perspective. Our problems look
different in light of eternity: “For our light affliction, which is
but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen,
but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen
are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal” (2 Cor.
4:17-18).

All our trials dim when we remember that one glorious day we will see
Jesus!

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, please help us to see this life from a heavenly perspective.
Remind us that our trials, however difficult, will one day fade from
view when we see You face to face.

The way we view eternity will affect the way we live in time.
