The Ultimate Reunion

We who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them. —
1 Thessalonians 4:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18

I’ll never forget the vigil of sitting by my dad’s bed as he spent his
last few days with us before slipping into eternity. To this day the
moment of his passing continues to have a profound effect on me. My
dad was always there for me. I could call him whenever I needed
counsel. I have great memories of our days fishing together; we would
talk about God and the Bible, and I would prompt him to tell those fun
stories from his youth on the farm.

But when Dad took his last breath, I became aware of the irreversible
finality of death. He was gone from this world. And my heart had a
vacancy sign hung on its door.

Yet, even in the midst of such loss and grief, God’s Word speaks
encouragingly into the emptiness. The apostle Paul teaches us that at
the coming of the Lord Jesus, those who have gone on before will rise
first and we “shall be caught up together with them . . . . And thus
we shall always be with the Lord” (1 Thess. 4:17). Now that’s a
reunion I’m really looking forward to! Not only to be reunited with my
dad, but to be with Jesus forever.

C. S. Lewis said, “Christians never say goodbye.” I’m eagerly awaiting
that ultimate reunion!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, in the midst of our sorrow and loss, remind us of the glorious
eternal reunion that is waiting for us. Comfort us in our grief and
fill our hearts with joyful anticipation of the day You will return!

O Death, where is your sting? —1 Corinthians 15:55
