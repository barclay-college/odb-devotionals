Lord, Help!

Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we
may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
Hebrews 4:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 4:14–16

I was so happy for my friend when she told me she was going to be a
mum! Together we counted the days until the birth. But when the baby
suffered a brain injury during delivery, my heart broke and I didn’t
know how to pray. All I knew was who I should pray to—God. He is our
Father, and He hears us when we call.

I knew that God was capable of miracles. He brought Jairus’s daughter
back to life (Luke 8:49-55) and in so doing also healed the girl of
whatever disease had robbed her of life. So I asked Him to bring
healing for my friend’s baby too.

But what if God doesn’t heal? I wondered. Surely He doesn’t lack the
power. Could it be He doesn’t care? I thought of Jesus’s suffering on
the cross and the explanation that “God demonstrates his own love for
us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom.
5:8). Then I remembered the questions of Job and how he learned to see
the wisdom of God as shown in the creation around him (Job 38–39).

Slowly I saw how God calls us to Him in the details of our lives. In
God’s grace, my friend and I learned together what it means to call on
the Lord and to trust Him—whatever the outcome.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, to whom can I go but You! I trust You with my life and the lives
of my loved ones. I’m grateful You always hear my cry.

When life knocks you down, you’re in the perfect position to pray!
