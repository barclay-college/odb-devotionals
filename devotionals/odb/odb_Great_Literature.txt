Great Literature

How sweet are your words . . . , sweeter than honey to my mouth!
Psalm 119:103

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:97-104

Recently I came across an article describing what constitutes great
literature. The author suggested that great literature “changes you.
When you are done reading, you’re a different person.”

In that light, the Word of God will always be classified as great
literature. Reading the Bible challenges us to be better. Stories of
biblical heroes inspire us to be courageous and persevering. The
wisdom and prophetic books warn of the danger of living by our fallen
instincts. God spoke through various writers to pen life-changing
psalms for our benefit. The teachings of Jesus shape our character to
become more like Him. The writings of Paul orient our minds and lives
to holy living. As the Holy Spirit brings these Scriptures to our
minds, they become powerful agents for change in our lives.

The writer of Psalm 119 loved God’s Word for its transforming
influence in his life. He recognized that the ancient Scriptures
handed down from Moses made him wise and more understanding than his
teachers (v. 99). It kept him from evil (v. 101). No wonder he
exclaimed, “Oh, how I love your law! I meditate on it all day long,”
and “How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my
mouth!” (vv. 97, 103).

Welcome to the joy of loving great literature, especially the life-
changing power of God’s Word!
