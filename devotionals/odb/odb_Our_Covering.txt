Our Covering

Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are
covered.
Psalm 32:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 3:21–26

When talking about faith in Jesus, we sometimes use words without
understanding or explaining them. One of those words is righteous. We
say that God has righteousness and that He makes people righteous, but
this can be a tough concept to grasp.

The way the word righteousness is pictured in the Chinese language is
helpful. It is a combination of two characters. The top word is lamb.
The bottom word is me. The lamb covers or is above the person.

When Jesus came to this world, John the Baptist called Him “the Lamb
of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29). We need our
sin taken care of because it separates us from God whose character and
ways are always perfect and right. Because His love for us is great,
God made His Son Jesus “who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in
him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Cor. 5:21). Jesus,
the Lamb, sacrificed Himself and shed His blood. He became our
“cover.” He makes us righteous, which places us in right relationship
with God.

Being right with God is a gift from Him. Jesus, the Lamb, is God’s way
to cover us.
