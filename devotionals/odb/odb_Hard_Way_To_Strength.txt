Hard Way To Strength

My strength is made perfect in weakness. —
2 Corinthians 12:9

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 12:1-10

Diamonds are beautiful and valuable gemstones, but their beginning is
common carbon—black, dirty, and combustible. Through years of intense
heat and high pressure, they become pure and strong. This makes them a
good metaphor for spiritual strength; God uses intense outside forces
to rid us of impurities and to perfect His strength in us.

God’s strength is made perfect in our weakness, says the apostle Paul
(2 Cor. 12:9). I wish this were not true because I hate being weak.
Chemotherapy and radiation treatments taught me more than I ever
wanted to know about physical weakness. Then a minor event plunged me
into a state of emotional weakness that caught me off guard. After
losing 3 feet of hair and being bald for nearly a year, one bad
haircut should not have been a big deal. But it was, and I felt silly
for being so weak. Some of us are able to create an illusion of
strength and self-sufficiency. But sudden loss of health, employment,
or a treasured relationship is a startling reminder of our total
dependence on God.

When we experience the fiery furnace of suffering—whether physical or
emotional, whether persecution from without or humiliation from
within—God’s loving purpose is to make us pure and strong.

Reflect & Pray

God uses testing in our lives To rid us of impurity And teach us that
our strength’s in Him And not in self-sufficiency. —Sper

Suffering is the fire that God uses to purify and strengthen us.
