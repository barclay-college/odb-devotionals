Embarrassing Moments

Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.” —
John 8:11

Today's Scripture: John 8:1-11

The flashing lights of the police car drew my attention to a motorist
who had been pulled over for a traffic violation. As the officer,
ticket book in hand, walked back to his car, I could clearly see the
embarrassed driver sitting helplessly behind the wheel of her car.
With her hands, she attempted to block her face from the view of
passersby—hoping to hide her identity. Her actions were a reminder to
me of how embarrassing it can be when we are exposed by our choices
and their consequences.

When a guilty woman was brought before Jesus and her immorality was
exposed, the crowd did more than just watch. They called for her
condemnation, but Jesus showed mercy. The only One with the right to
judge sin responded to her failure with compassion. After dispatching
her accusers, “Jesus said to her, ‘Neither do I condemn you; go and
sin no more’” (John 8:11). His compassion reminds us of His forgiving
grace, and His command to her points to His great desire that we live
in the joy of that grace. Both elements show the depth of Christ’s
concern for us when we stumble and fall.

Even in our most embarrassing moments of failure, we can cry out to
Him and find that His grace is truly amazing.

Reflect & Pray

Amazing grace — how sweet the sound —  That saved a wretch like me! I
once was lost, but now am found; Was blind, but now I see. — Newton

Jesus alone can supply the grace we need for each trial we face.
