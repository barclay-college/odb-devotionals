Learning to Count

How precious to me are your thoughts, God!
Psalm 139:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 139:14–18

My son is learning to count from one to ten. He counts everything from
toys to trees. He counts things I tend to overlook, like the
wildflowers on his way to school or the toes on my feet.

My son is also teaching me to count again. Often I become so immersed
in things I haven’t finished or things I don’t have that I fail to see
all the good things around me. I have forgotten to count the new
friends made this year and the answered prayers received, the tears of
joy shed and the times of laughter with good friends.

My ten fingers are not enough to count all that God gives me day by
day. “Many, Lord my God, are the wonders you have done, the things you
planned for us. None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of
your deeds, they would be too many to declare” (Ps. 40:5). How can we
even begin to count all the blessings of salvation, reconciliation,
and eternal life?

Let us join David as he praises God for all His precious thoughts
about us and all He has done for us, when he says, “How precious to me
are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them! Were I to count
them, they would outnumber the grains of sand” (139:17–18).

Let’s learn to count again!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, Your works are so many and good I can’t count them all. But I
thank You for each one.

Let’s thank God for His countless blessings.
