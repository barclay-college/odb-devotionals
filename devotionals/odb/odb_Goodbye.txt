Goodbye

When the people complained, it displeased the Lord; for the Lord heard
it, and His anger was aroused. —
Numbers 11:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Numbers 11:1-10

When Max Lucado participated in a half-Ironman triathlon, he
experienced the negative power of complaint. He said, “After the
1.2-mile swim and the 56-mile bike ride, I didn’t have much energy
left for the 13.1-mile run. Neither did the fellow jogging next to me.
He said, ‘This stinks. This race is the dumbest decision I’ve ever
made.’ I said, ‘Goodbye.’ ” Max knew that if he listened too long, he
would start agreeing with him. So he said goodbye and kept running.

Among the Israelites, too many people listened too long to complaints
and began to agree with them. This displeased God, and for good
reason. God had delivered the Israelites from slavery, and agreed to
live in their midst, but they still complained. Beyond the hardship of
the desert, they were dissatisfied with God’s provision of manna. In
their complaint, Israel forgot that the manna was a gift to them from
God’s loving hand (Num. 11:6). Because complaining poisons the heart
with ingratitude and can be a contagion, God had to judge it.

This is a sure way to say “goodbye” to complaining and ingratitude:
Each day, let’s rehearse the faithfulness and goodness of God to us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You have given us so much. Forgive us for our short memories and
bad attitudes. Help us to remember and be grateful for all that You
have provided. And help us to tell others of the good things You have
done for us.

Proclaiming God’s faithfulness silences discontentment.
