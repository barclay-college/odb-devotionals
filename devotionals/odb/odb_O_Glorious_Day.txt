O Glorious Day!

He is not here; for He is risen. —
Matthew 28:6

Today's Scripture: Matthew 27:27-31;28:1-6

It was the day after. My favorite team had just lost its final game
and the dream of a championship was now over. It was cold out and a
bit gloomy as I got in the car to go to work. None of this should have
mattered much, but it was shaping up to be a blue Monday.

But then a song came on the radio that transformed my perspective. It
was Casting Crowns singing “Glorious Day.” “One day they led [Christ]
up Calvary’s mountain, one day they nailed Him to die on a tree.”
Nothing encouraging yet. “Suffering anguish, despised and
rejected”—more bad news. But then the song describes the good news of
Christ’s resurrection and His victory over death.

Out of that worst of days—out of the noontime darkness on that
Jerusalem hillside—has come the only true hope for mankind. Because
Jesus “took the nails for me,” as the song says, “He carried my sins
far away.” And one day He’s coming back—“O glorious day!”

Perhaps today did not start out well for you. Maybe you face a host of
trouble that threatens to turn this into a day of despair. Turn your
attention to Jesus. Review what He did for you at Calvary and how He
conquered death by His resurrection: “He is not here; for He is
risen”! (Matt. 28:6). That can make any day a glorious day!

Reflect & Pray

Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me; Buried, He carried my sins
far away; Rising, He justified freely forever; One day He’s coming—O
glorious day! —Chapman

Christ’s empty tomb fills us with hope.
