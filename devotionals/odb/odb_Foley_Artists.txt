Foley Artists

Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. —
2 Corinthians 11:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 16:7-15

Crunch. Crunch. Whoosh! In the early days of film, Foley artists
created sounds to support the story’s action. Squeezing a leather
pouch filled with cornstarch made the sound of snow crunching, shaking
a pair of gloves sounded like bird wings flapping, and waving a thin
stick made a whoosh sound. To make movies as realistic as possible,
these artists used creative techniques to replicate sounds.

Like sounds, messages can be replicated. One of Satan’s most
frequently used techniques is that of replicating messages in
spiritually dangerous ways. Paul warns in 2 Corinthians 11:13-14, “For
such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves
into apostles of Christ. And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms
himself into an angel of light.” Paul is warning us about false
teachers who turn our attention away from Jesus Christ and the message
of His grace.

Jesus said that one purpose of the Holy Spirit living in us is that
“when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all
truth” (John 16:13). With the help and guidance of the Spirit, we can
find the safety of truth in a world of counterfeit messages.

Reflect & Pray

We need You, Holy Spirit, to help us discern truth from error. We can
be easily deceived by others or even by our own hearts. May we be open
to learn from You and not be led astray.

The Holy Spirit is our ever-present Teacher.
