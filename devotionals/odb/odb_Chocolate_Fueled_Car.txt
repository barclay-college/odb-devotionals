Chocolate-Fueled Car

The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. —
Psalm 19:7

Today's Scripture: 1 Kings 19:1-8

Many people like both the sweetness and the energy they get from
chocolate. Yet British auto technicians have found a surprising use
for this sweet food. Scientists at the University of Warwick have
built a racecar that runs on vegetable oils and chocolate. The fuel
provides energy so that the car can reach top speeds of 135 mph.

The Bible also records a surprising source of energy from a food. When
Elijah had been used by God on Mt. Carmel to call fire down from
heaven, this spiritual high was followed by persecution and
melancholy. In response to Elijah’s depression, God sent an angel to
provide food, drink, and rest for the weary prophet. The sustaining
power of that food from heaven was remarkable: “So he arose, and ate
and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and
forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God” (1 Kings 19:8).

Just as we need food to sustain our physical lives, we also need
nourishing food for our spiritual lives. God’s Word is “sweeter . . .
than honey and the honeycomb” (Ps. 19:10) and feeds our souls. It
makes “wise the simple” (v.7) and provides both nourishment and energy
for life’s long journey. Take time to feed on it.
