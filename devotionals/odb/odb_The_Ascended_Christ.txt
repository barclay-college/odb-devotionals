The Ascended Christ

We have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus
the Son of God. —
Hebrews 4:14

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 4:9-16

Today is Ascension Day—a day that is often neglected. Coming 40 days
after Easter, it marks the occasion when the risen Christ ascended to
the Father in glory.

W. H. Griffith Thomas writes in The International Standard Bible
Encyclopedia: “The ascension is not only a great fact of the New
Testament, but a great factor in the life of Christ and Christians,
and no complete view of Jesus Christ is possible unless the ascension
and its consequences are included.”

Thomas then summarizes what the ascension means to believers. It
speaks of an accomplished redemption (Heb. 8:1), the Savior’s high-
priestly work (Heb. 4:14), His lordship over the church (Eph. 1:22),
His intercession for us with His heavenly Father (1 Tim. 2:5), the
coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:33), the Lord’s
presence with us today (Matt. 28:20), and the expectation of His
return to this earth (1 Thess. 4:16).

Think of it! Jesus not only died, but He rose from the grave, went
back to the Father, and is interceding for us right now. And He is
coming again.

May this Ascension Day be a time for special rejoicing and
thanksgiving to God.

Reflect & Pray

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer, One day the stone
rolled away from the door; Then He arose, over death He had conquered;
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore. —Chapman

Jesus who died to save us now lives to keep us.
