Clothed by God

See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.
Zechariah 3:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Zechariah 3

When my kids were toddlers, they would play outside in our sodden
English garden and quickly become covered in mud and dirt. For their
good and the good of my floor, I’d remove their clothes at the door
and wrap them in towels before sticking them in the bath. They’d soon
move from dirty to clean with the addition of soap, water, and hugs.

In a vision given to Zechariah, we see Joshua, a high priest, covered
in rags that represent sin and wrongdoing (Zech. 3:3). But the Lord
makes him clean, removing his filthy clothes and covering him in rich
garments (3:5). The new turban and robe signify that the Lord has
taken his sins from him.

We too can receive God’s cleansing as we become free of our wrongdoing
through the saving work of Jesus. As a result of His death on the
cross, we can have the mud and sins that cling to us washed away as we
receive the robes of God’s sons and daughters. No longer are we
defined by what we’ve done wrong (whether lying, gossiping, stealing,
coveting, or other), but we can claim the names God gives to those He
loves—restored, renewed, cleansed, free.

Ask God to remove any filthy rags you’re wearing so you too can put on
the wardrobe He has reserved for you.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, through Your saving death on the cross we can find
acceptance and love. May we receive this gift for Your glory.

Who can wash away my sin? Jesus!
