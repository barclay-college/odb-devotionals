Second Chances

He has not stopped showing his kindness.
Ruth 2:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ruth 4:13–17

“How can you be so kind if you don’t even know me!”

By making some wrong decisions, Linda had ended up in jail in a
country not her own. For six years she remained in prison, and when
she was set free she didn’t have anywhere to go. She thought her life
was over! While her family gathered money to buy her ticket home, a
kind couple offered her lodging, food, and a helping hand. Linda was
so touched by their kindness that she willingly listened as they told
her the good news of a God who loves her and wants to give her a
second chance.

Linda reminds me of Naomi, a widow in the Bible who lost her husband
and two sons in a foreign land and thought her life was over (Ruth 1).
However, the Lord hadn’t forgotten Naomi, and through the love of her
daughter-in-law and the compassion of a godly man named Boaz, Naomi
saw God’s love and was given a second chance (4:13–17).

The same God cares for us today. Through the love of others we can be
reminded of His presence. We can see God’s grace in the helping hand
of people we may not even know well. But above all, God is willing to
give us a fresh start. We just need, like Linda and Naomi, to see
God’s hand in our everyday lives and realize He never stops showing us
His kindness.
