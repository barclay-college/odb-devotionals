A Double Promise

In perfect faithfulness you have done wonderful things, things planned
long ago.
Isaiah 25:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 25:1–9

Since she suffered with cancer several years ago, Ruth has been unable
to eat, drink, or even swallow properly. She has also lost a lot of
her physical strength, and numerous operations and treatments have
left her a shadow of what she used to be.

Yet Ruth is still able to praise God; her faith remains strong, and
her joy is infectious. She relies on God daily, and holds on to the
hope that she will recover fully one day. She prays for healing and is
confident that God will answer—sooner or later. What an awesome faith!

Ruth explained that what keeps her faith strong is the secure
knowledge that God will not only fulfill His promises in His time, but
will also sustain her until that happens. This was the same hope that
God’s people had as they waited for Him to complete His plans (Isaiah
25:1), deliver them from their enemies (v. 2), wipe away their tears,
remove their disgrace, and “swallow up death forever” (v. 8).

In the meantime, God gave His people refuge and shelter (v. 4) as they
waited. He comforted them in their ordeals, gave them strength to
endure, and gave them assurance that He was there with them.

This is the double promise we have—the hope of deliverance one day,
plus the provision of His comfort, strength, and shelter throughout
our lives.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for Your wonderful gift of hope. You have promised to
save me and to walk with me every day of my life.

Trusting God’s faithfulness can dispel our fearfulness.
