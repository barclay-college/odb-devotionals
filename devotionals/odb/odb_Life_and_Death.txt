Life and Death

I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid.
Genesis 50:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 50:22–26

I will never forget sitting at the bedside of my friend’s brother when
he died; the scene was one of the ordinary visited by the
extraordinary. Three of us were talking quietly when we realized that
Richard’s breathing was becoming more labored. We gathered around him,
watching, waiting, and praying. When he took his last breath, it felt
like a holy moment; the presence of God enveloped us in the midst of
our tears over a wonderful man dying in his forties.

Many of the heroes of our faith experienced God’s faithfulness when
they died. For instance, Jacob announced he would soon be “gathered to
[his] people” (Gen. 49:29–33). Jacob’s son Joseph also announced his
impending death: “I am about to die,” he said to his brothers while
instructing them how to hold firm in their faith. He seems to be at
peace, yet eager that his brothers trust the Lord (50:24).

None of us knows when or how we will breathe our last breath, but we
can ask God to help us trust that He will be with us. We can believe
the promise that Jesus will prepare a place for us in His Father’s
house (John 14:2–3).

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, Your dwelling place will be with Your people, and You will
be our God, wiping away our tears and banishing death. May it be so!

The Lord will never abandon us, especially at the time of our death.
