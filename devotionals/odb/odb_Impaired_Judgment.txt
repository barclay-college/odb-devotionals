Impaired Judgment

Do not judge, or you too will be judged.
Matthew 7:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 7:1–6

I’ve been quick to judge anyone I saw walking in the street while
staring at a phone. How could they be so oblivious to the cars about
to hit them? I’ve told myself. Don’t they care about their own safety?
But one day, while crossing the entrance to an alleyway, I was so
engrossed in a text message, that I missed seeing a car at my left.
Thankfully, the driver saw me and came to an abrupt stop. But I felt
ashamed. All of my self-righteous finger-pointing came back to haunt
me. I had judged others, only to do the same thing myself.

My hypocrisy is the kind of thinking that Jesus addressed in the
Sermon on the Mount: “First take the plank out of your own eye, and
then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye”
(Matthew 7:5). I had a huge “plank”—a blind spot through which I
judged others with my own impaired judgment.

“For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged,” Jesus also
said (7:2). Recalling the disgusted look on the driver’s face that
day, after having to make an abrupt stop when I walked in front of the
car, I’m reminded of the disgusted looks I gave others engrossed in
their phones.

None of us is perfect. But sometimes I forget that in my haste to
judge others. We’re all in need of God’s grace.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, please help me be quicker to console or encourage,
and slower to judge someone else.

Be slow to judge others.
