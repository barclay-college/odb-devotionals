The Angel Of Music

Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. —
2 Corinthians 11:14

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 6:10-18

In Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical The Phantom of the Opera, a young
chorus girl named Christine Daae receives voice training from a
mysterious musician she calls the “Angel of Music.” Christine believes
this is the angel her dying father had promised to send to complete
her musical training.

As the plot thickens, we find that her mysterious mentor is really a
demented man who wants to carry her away into a bizarre underworld
beneath the opera house. What the girl thinks is a supernatural agent
sent by her beloved father is really a madman who wants to possess her
for his own ends. The “Angel of Music” is evil masquerading as good.

The believer in Christ also faces an evil one who masquerades. One of
Satan’s key strategies is to look like someone who is good. Paul told
us, “Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light” (2
Corinthians 11:14). The Greek word translated as “transforms” means
“to change appearance, masquerade, or disguise oneself.”

In preparing us to face the evil strategies of the devil, God has
provided all the equipment we need to stand our ground. Protecting
ourselves with the armor of God unmasks the evil that opposes us and
stabilizes our spiritual walk (Ephesians 6:10-18).

Reflect & Pray

When you’re making a decision, Evil sometimes wears a mask; Trust the
Lord for true discernment— He’ll give wisdom if you ask.  —Hess

God’s armor is tailor-made for us, but we must put it on.
