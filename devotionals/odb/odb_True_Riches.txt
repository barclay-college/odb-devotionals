True Riches

For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
Luke 12:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 12:22–34

At the memorial service for my friend’s dad, someone said to her,
“Until I met your father, I didn’t know a person could have fun while
helping others.” Her dad contributed his part in helping to build the
kingdom of God through serving people, laughing and loving, and
meeting strangers who became friends. When he died, he left a legacy
of love. In contrast, my friend’s aunt—her father’s older
sister—viewed her possessions as her legacy, spending her latter years
worrying about who would protect her heirlooms and rare books.

In His teaching and by His example, Jesus warned His followers to
avoid hoarding possessions, to give to the poor, and to value what
will not rust or decay. “For where your treasure is,” Jesus said,
“there your heart will be also” (Luke 12:34).

We might think our things give meaning to our life. But when the
latest gadget breaks or we misplace or lose something valuable, we
begin to realize that it is our relationship with the Lord that
satisfies and endures. It is our love and care for others that does
not wither and fade away.

Let’s ask the Lord to help us see clearly what we value, to show us
where our heart is, and to help us seek His kingdom above all (12:31).

Reflect & Pray

What do you value? Read the story about the manna in the wilderness in
Exodus 16. Consider how this story relates to Jesus’s words to the
crowds in Luke 12.

What we value reveals the state of our heart.
