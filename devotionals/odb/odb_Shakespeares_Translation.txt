Shakespeare’s Translation?

No prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation. —
2 Peter 1:20

Today's Scripture: 2 Peter 1:16-2:3

Some have speculated that William Shakespeare helped translate the
King James Bible. They say that he inserted a cryptogram (a message
written in code) while he translated Psalm 46. In this psalm, the 46th
word from the beginning is shake and the 46th word from the end is
spear. Furthermore, in 1610, while the King James Bible was being
translated, Shakespeare would have been 46 years old. Despite these
coincidences, no serious evidence supports this theory.

Some people also claim to have found hidden meanings when interpreting
the Bible. Certain cults will cite a verse out of context, only to
lead someone into heretical doctrine. Some quote John 14:16, for
example, and say that the “Helper” refers to their “new revelation.”
When compared with other Scripture, however, the Helper whom Jesus
sent to us is obviously the Holy Spirit (John 16:7-14; Acts 2:1-4).

The apostle Peter wrote, “No prophecy of Scripture is of any private
interpretation” (2 Peter 1:20). To interpret a biblical passage
accurately, we must always consider the context and compare it with
other Scripture. This respects the clear meaning of the Bible without
trying to find hidden meaning in it.

God’s Word does not have secret codes That need a special key; It’s
understandable and clear, With truth for all to see.  —Sper

The best interpreter of Scripture is Scripture itself.
