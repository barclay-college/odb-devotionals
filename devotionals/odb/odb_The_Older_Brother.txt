The Older Brother

[They] muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”
Luke 15:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 15:11–13; 17–24

Author Henri Nouwen recalls his visit to a museum in St. Petersburg,
Russia, where he spent hours reflecting on Rembrandt’s portrayal of
the prodigal son. As the day wore on, changes in the natural lighting
from a nearby window left Nouwen with the impression that he was
seeing as many different paintings as there were changes of light.
Each seemed to reveal something else about a father’s love for his
broken son.

Nouwen describes how, at about four o’clock, three figures in the
painting appeared to “step forward.” One was the older son who
resented his father’s willingness to roll out the red carpet for the
homecoming of his younger brother, the prodigal. After all, hadn’t he
squandered so much of the family fortune, causing them pain and
embarrassment in the process? (Luke 15:28–30).

The other two figures reminded Nouwen of the religious leaders who
were present as Jesus told His parable. They were the ones who
muttered in the background about the sinners Jesus was attracting (vv.
1–2).

Nouwen saw himself in all of them—in the wasted life of his youngest
son, in the condemning older brother and religious leaders, and in a
Father’s heart that’s big enough for anyone and everyone.

What about us? Can we see ourselves anywhere in Rembrandt’s painting?
In some way, every story Jesus told is about us.

Reflect & Pray

How might you reflect again on the story Jesus told and on the
Rembrandt painting? As the light changes, where do you find yourself?

Father, help me to see myself for how much You love me.
