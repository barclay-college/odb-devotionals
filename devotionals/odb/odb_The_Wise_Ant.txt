The Wise Ant

[The ant] provides her supplies in the summer, and gathers her food in
the harvest. —
Proverbs 6:8

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 6:6-11

Every year I do something special to celebrate the arrival of spring
—I buy ant traps. Those little invaders continually march into our
kitchen in search of any crumb left on the floor. They aren’t picky; a
shard of potato chip, a grain of rice, or even a speck of cheese will
do.

Although ants may be a nuisance, Solomon praised them for their
steadfast work ethic (Prov. 6:6-11). He pointed out that ants are
self-directed. They have “no captain, overseer, or ruler” (v.7), yet
they are very productive. The ants also keep busy even when it’s not
immediately necessary, providing supplies in the summer and gathering
food in the harvest (v.8). By the time winter arrives, they’re not
worried about what they will eat. Little by little, these hard workers
have saved up enough to sustain themselves.

We can learn from the ant. When God gives us times of plenty, we can
prepare for times when resources may be low. God is the provider of
all that we have, including our ability to work. We are to work
diligently, be wise stewards of what He has provided, and then rest in
the promise of His care (Matt. 6:25-34).

Let’s remember Solomon’s advice: “Go to the ant . . . . Con-sider her
ways and be wise” (Prov. 6:6).
