The Valley of Vision

I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you.
Jonah 2:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jonah 2:1-10

The Puritan prayer “The Valley of Vision” speaks of the distance
between a sinful man and his holy God. The man says to God, “Thou hast
brought me to the valley of vision . . . ; hemmed in by mountains of
sin I behold Thy glory.” Aware of his wrongs, the man still has hope.
He continues, “Stars can be seen from the deepest wells, and the
deeper the wells the brighter Thy stars shine.” Finally, the poem ends
with a request: “Let me find Thy light in my darkness, . . . Thy glory
in my valley.”

Jonah found God’s glory during his time in the ocean’s depths. He
rebelled against God and ended up in a fish’s stomach, overcome by his
sin. There, Jonah cried to God: “You cast me into the deep . . . . The
waters surrounded me, even to my soul” (Jonah 2:3,5 nkjv). Despite his
situation, Jonah said, “I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to
you” (v. 7). God heard his prayer and caused the fish to free him.

Although sin creates distance between God and us, we can look up from
the lowest points in our lives and see Him—His holiness, goodness, and
grace. If we turn away from our sin and confess it to God, He will
forgive us. God answers prayers from the valley.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, in the daytime stars can be seen from deepest wells, and the
deeper the wells the brighter Your stars shine; let me find Your light
in my darkness.

The darkness of sin only makes the light of God’s grace shine
brighter.
