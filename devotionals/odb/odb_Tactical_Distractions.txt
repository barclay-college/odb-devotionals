Tactical Distractions

The Lord replied, “Is it right for you to be angry?”
Jonah 4:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jonah 4

It became painfully clear the first time my wife and I collaborated on
a writing project that procrastination was going to be a major
obstacle. Her role was to edit my work and keep me on schedule; my
role seemed to be to drive her crazy. Most times, her organization and
patience outlasted my resistance to deadlines and direction.

I promised to have a certain amount of writing done by the end of one
day. For the first hour, I plugged away diligently. Satisfied with
what I’d accomplished so far, I decided to take a break. Before I knew
it, my time was up. In trouble for sure, I thought of a way out. I set
about doing a couple of chores my wife despised and which always
netted me praise when I did them.

My plan failed.

I sometimes play the same games with God. He brings specific people
into my life He wants me to serve or tasks He wants me to accomplish.
Like Jonah, who went another way when God gave Him an assignment
(Jonah 4:2), I need to set aside my own feelings. I often try to
impress God with good deeds or spiritual activity when what He really
wants is obedience to His priorities. Inevitably, my plan fails.

Are you dodging duties God makes clear He wants you to tackle? Trust
me: Real contentment comes from doing it in His strength and in His
way.

Reflect & Pray

Loving Father, help us to recognize our busyness and distractions for
what they so often are—disobedience and inattention to the work You
have given us to do.

Obedience pleases God.
