Faith in Action

Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my
deeds.
James 2:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 2:14–26

As a friend drove to the grocery store, she noticed a woman walking
along the side of the road and felt she should turn the car around and
offer her a ride. When she did, she was saddened to hear that the
woman didn’t have money for the bus so was walking home many miles in
the hot and humid weather. Not only was she making the long journey
home, but she had also walked several hours that morning to arrive at
work by 4 a.m.

By offering a ride, my friend put into practice in a modern setting
James’s instruction for Christians to live out their faith with their
deeds: “Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead”
(v. 17). He was concerned that the church take care of the widows and
the orphans (James 1:27), and he also wanted them to rely not on empty
words but to act on their faith with deeds of love.

We are saved by faith, not works, but we live out our faith by loving
others and caring for their needs. May we, like my friend who offered
the ride, keep our eyes open for those who might need our help as we
walk together in this journey of life.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus Christ, You did the ultimate deed by dying on the cross for
me. May I never forget the sacrifice that gives me life.

We live out our faith through our good deeds.
