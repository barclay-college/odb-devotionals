The Unknown Giver

When you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what
your right hand is doing. —
Matthew 6:3

Today's Scripture: Matthew 6:1-4

I don’t know about you, but I tend to enjoy getting credit when I do
stuff for others. And I don’t think I’m alone in appreciating thank
you cards and words of gratitude.

I also know, however, that there’s something to be said for anonymity.
This must be a good way to give, because Jesus endorsed it.

That’s why I was impressed with a gift that arrived anonymously on our
front porch one day. We had been out of town; and when we returned,
there stood several flower pots—each holding a blooming sunflower. We
knew the reason—they were left on our doorstep on the birthday of our
late daughter, Melissa, who loved sunflowers. Someone was telling us,
“We remember Mell.” By giving anonymously, they focused completely on
our family rather than on themselves.

Imagine a world in which we all gave generously and selflessly. Jesus
mentioned secret giving in Matthew 6. He said, “When you do a
charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand
is doing, that your charitable deed may be in secret” (vv.3-4).

Realistically, we can’t always give anonymously. But our giving should
always be marked with the same spirit of selfless humility and God-
directed charity.
