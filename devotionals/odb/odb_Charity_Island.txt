Charity Island

The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who
trust in him.
Nahum 1:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 107:23–32

Charity Island is the largest island in Saginaw Bay in the Michigan
waters of Lake Huron. For many years the island has provided a
lighthouse for navigational aid and a safe harbor for those sailing
these waters. The island received its name because sailors believed it
was there “through the charity of God.”

Sometimes in life we have to navigate through seas of troubling
circumstances. Like those sailors we need guidance and a place of
safety; we might wish for our own Charity Island. The psalmist
understood that God is the one who can bring tranquility to troubled
waters and guide us to safe harbors. He wrote, “He stilled the storm
to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed. They were glad when it
grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven” (Ps. 107:29-30).

While no one asks for the storms of life, they can multiply our
appreciation for the guidance and refuge God provides. He offers the
light of His Spirit and His Word to guide us. It is the safe harbor of
His love that we long for. He alone can be our ultimate “Charity
Island.”
