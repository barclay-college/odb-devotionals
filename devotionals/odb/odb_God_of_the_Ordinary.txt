God of the Ordinary

He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.
1 Corinthians 10:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 12:1–4; 17:1–2

Hearing testimonies about how God did something spectacular in someone
else’s life can challenge us. While we may rejoice to hear about
answers to prayer, we may also wonder why God hasn’t done anything
amazing for us lately.

It’s easy to think that if God showed up in astonishing ways for us
like He did for Abraham, then we would be more inspired to be faithful
servants of God. But then we remember that God showed up for Abraham
every 12 to 14 years, and most of Abraham’s journey was rather
ordinary (see Gen. 12:1–4; 15:1–6; 16:16–17:12).

God’s work is usually done behind the scenes in the ordinary things of
life. As 1 Corinthians 10 says, “He will not let you be tempted beyond
what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a
way out.” Every day God is busy shielding us from devastating
onslaughts of Satan that would otherwise leave us helplessly defeated.
And when temptation hits, He is making exit ramps for us so we can
escape.

When we put our head on the pillow at night, we should pause to thank
God for the amazing things He has done for us that day in the midst of
our ordinary lives. So, instead of longing for Him to do something
spectacular for you, thank Him! He already has.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to be constantly aware that Your power and presence are
with me even in the ordinary times in my life. Thank You for Your
amazing work on my behalf that I know nothing about.

God is always in control behind the scenes, even on “ordinary” days.
