Nobody Likes Me

No one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my
life.
Psalm 142:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 142

As a child, when I felt lonely, rejected, or sorry for myself, my
mother would sometimes attempt to cheer me up by singing a popular
ditty: “Nobody likes me, everybody hates me. I think I’ll go eat
worms.” After a smile came from my downcast face, she’d help me see
the many special relationships and reasons for gratitude I truly did
have.

When I read that David felt no one cared for him, that ditty rings in
my ears. Yet David’s pain wasn’t at all exaggerated. Where I had
feelings of loneliness typical for my age, David actually had good
reason to feel abandoned. He wrote these words in the dark depths of a
cave where he hid from Saul, who pursued him with murderous plans (1
Samuel 22:1; 24:3–10). David had been anointed as Israel’s future king
(16:13), had spent years in Saul’s service, but now he lived “on the
move,” always fearing for his life. In the midst of the loneliness
David felt, he cried out to God as his “refuge” and “portion in the
land of the living” (Psalm 142:5).

Like David, we can cry out to God when we feel alone, giving voice to
our feelings in the safety of His love. God never minimizes our
loneliness. He wants to be our companion in the dark caves of our
lives. Even when we think no one cares for our life, God cares!
