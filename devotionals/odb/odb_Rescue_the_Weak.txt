Rescue the Weak

Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the
wicked.
Psalm 82:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 82:3–4

Which would you choose—a skiing holiday in Switzerland or rescuing
children from danger in Prague? Nicholas Winton, just an ordinary man,
chose the latter. In 1938, war between Czechoslovakia and Germany
seemed on the horizon. After Nicholas visited refugee camps in Prague,
where many Jewish citizens lived in horrible conditions, he felt
compelled to come up with a plan to help. He raised money to transport
hundreds of children safely out of Prague to Great Britain to be cared
for by British families before the onset of World War II.

His actions exemplified those called for in Psalm 82: “Uphold the
cause of the poor and the oppressed” (v. 3). Asaph, the writer of this
psalm, wanted to stir his people to champion the cause of those in
need: “Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of
the wicked” (v. 4). Like the children Nicholas worked tirelessly to
rescue, the psalmist spoke for those who couldn’t speak for
themselves—the poor and the widowed who needed justice and protection.

Everywhere we look today we see people in need due to war, storms, and
other hardships. Although we can’t solve every problem, we can
prayerfully consider what we can do to help in the situations God
brings into our lives.
