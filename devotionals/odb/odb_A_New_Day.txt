A New Day

This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
—
Psalm 118:24

Today's Scripture: Psalm 118:19-29

In a morning meeting I recently attended, the person who opened the
gathering began by praying, “Lord, thanks for today. It is the
beginning of a new day we have never seen before.” Although the idea
seemed obvious, that prayer got me thinking about a couple of
different things. First, because each day is a new opportunity, it
will be filled with things we cannot anticipate or even prepare for.
Therefore, it’s important that we recognize our limitations and lean
heavily on God—intentionally choosing to live in His grace and
strength rather than relying on our own resources.

The second thing that occurred to me is that the newness of each day
is a gift worth celebrating. Perhaps this concept was what prompted
the psalmist to declare, “This is the day the Lord has made; we will
rejoice and be glad in it” (Ps. 118:24).

Of course, we face many unknowns today—and some could be difficult.
But the treasure of each brand-new day is so special that Moses was
led to write, “Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart
of wisdom” (90:12). Every new day is a precious gift. May we
thankfully embrace each one with confident trust and humble
celebration.

Reflect & Pray

He whose heart is kind beyond all measure Gives unto each day what He
deems best— Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure, Mingling toil
with peace and rest. —Berg

Each new day gives us new reasons to praise the Lord.
