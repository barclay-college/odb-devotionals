Slowing Down Time

Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
Psalm 90:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 90:4, 12–15

A lot has changed since the electric clock was invented in the 1840s.
We now keep time on smart watches, smart phones, and laptops. The
entire pace of life seems faster—with even our “leisurely” walking
speeding up. This is especially true in cities and can have a negative
effect on health, scholars say. “We’re just moving faster and faster
and getting back to people as quickly as we can,” Professor Richard
Wiseman observed. “That’s driving us to think everything has to happen
now.”

Moses, the writer of one of the oldest of the Bible’s psalms,
reflected on time. He reminds us that God controls life’s pace. “A
thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or
like a watch in the night,” he wrote (Psalm 90:4).

The secret to time management, therefore, isn’t to go faster or
slower. It’s to abide in God, spending more time with Him. Then we get
in step with each other, but first with Him—the One who formed us
(139:13) and knows our purpose and plans (v. 16).

Our time on earth won’t last forever. Yet we can manage it wisely, not
by watching the clock, but by giving each day to God. As Moses said,
“Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom”
(90:12). Then, with God we’ll always be on time, now and forever.

Reflect & Pray

What’s your pace in life? How could you spend more time with God,
getting in step with Him?

Gracious God, when we fall out of step with You, draw us closer to
abide in You.
