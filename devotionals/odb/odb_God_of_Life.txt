God of Life

Lord my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and
majesty.
Psalm 104:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 104:1–12, 24–30

A few winters ago, my hometown experienced an unusually long blast of
bone-chilling temperatures that finally gave way to the warmer weather
of spring. For two weeks straight, the outside thermometer dipped well
below the sub-zero degree mark (-20 C; -5 F).

On one particularly bitter cold morning, the sound of chirping birds
broke the silence of night. Dozens, if not hundreds, sang their hearts
out. If I didn’t know any better, I could have sworn the little
creatures were crying out to their Creator to please warm things up!

Bird experts tell us that the multitude of birdsongs we hear during
late winter mornings are mostly male birds, attempting to attract
mates and claim their territories. Their chirping reminded me that God
fine-tuned His creation to sustain and flourish life—because He is a
God of life.

In a psalm that marvels at God’s flourishing earth, the author begins,
“Let all that I am praise the Lord ” (Psalm 104:1 nlt ). He went on to
write, “The birds of the sky nest by the waters; they sing among the
branches” (v. 12).

From singing and nesting birds to a vast ocean “teeming with creatures
beyond number” (v. 25), we see reasons to praise the Creator for the
lengths He’s gone to ensure that all of life thrives.

Reflect & Pray

Thank God for the world He has made. List the parts of His creation
