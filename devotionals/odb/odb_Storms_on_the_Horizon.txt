Storms on the Horizon

What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!
Matthew 8:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 8:23-28

Our son, Josh, is a commercial salmon fisherman in Kodiak, Alaska.
Some time ago he sent me a photograph he took of a tiny vessel a few
hundred yards ahead of his boat moving through a narrow pass. Ominous
storm clouds loom on the horizon. But a rainbow, the sign of God’s
providence and loving care, stretches from one side of the pass to the
other, encircling the little boat.

The photograph reflects our earthly voyage: We sail into an uncertain
future, but we are surrounded by the faithfulness of God!

Jesus’ disciples were surrounded by a storm, and He used the
experience to teach them about the power and faithfulness of God
(Matt. 8:23-27). We seek answers for the uncertainties of life. We
watch the future growing closer and wonder what will happen to us
there. Puritan poet John Keble captured this in one of his poems in
which he watched the future as it drew near. But as he watched he was
“waiting to see what God will do.”

Whether young or old we all face uncertain futures. Heaven answers:
God’s love and goodness encircle us no matter what awaits us. We wait
and see what God will do!
