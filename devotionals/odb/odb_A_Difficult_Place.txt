A Difficult Place

I will never leave you nor forsake you. —
Hebrews 13:5

Today's Scripture: Acts 8:4-8,26-35

When a sudden change in technology made his job obsolete, a highly
trained scientist found himself working in a fast-food restaurant. One
evening after our Bible study he described the situation as difficult
and humbling. He said, “One good thing I can say is that the young
people there seem very interested in my faith.” A member of the group
responded, “I admire you for being humble. I know your faith must have
something to do with it.”

Like my acquaintance, Philip may have wondered why God would pull him
off an assignment in Samaria (Acts 8:4-8) and plop him in the middle
of the desert (v.26). But then he found that the Ethiopian needed help
understanding the Scriptures (vv.27-35), and his place made sense.

When Jesus promised He would never leave us alone (Matt. 28:20; Heb.
13:5), He meant in the hard times as well as in the good times. Our
mission in the difficult seasons of life is to work or serve
remembering we are doing it for God, and then to watch as God works to
accomplish His purposes.

Look for God in your difficult place and discover what He’s doing in
and through you there.

Reflect & Pray

Disappointment—His appointment, No good thing will He withhold; From
denials oft we gather Treasures of His love untold. —Young

What’s better than answers to our why questions? Trusting a good God
who has His reasons.
