Start Afresh

His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your
faithfulness.
Lamentations 3:22-23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 86:5-15

When I was growing up, one of my favorite books was Anne of Green
Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery. In one amusing passage, young Anne, by
mistake, adds a skin medication instead of vanilla to the cake she is
making. Afterward, she exclaims hopefully to her stern-faced guardian,
Marilla, “Isn’t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no
mistakes in it yet?”

I like that thought: tomorrow is a new day—a new day when we can start
afresh. We all make mistakes. But when it comes to sin, God’s
forgiveness is what enables us to start each morning with a clean
slate. When we repent, He chooses to remember our sins no more (Jer.
31:34; Heb. 8:12).

Some of us have made wrong choices in our lives, but our past words
and deeds need not define our future in God’s eyes. There is always a
fresh start. When we ask for His forgiveness, we take a first step
toward restoring our relationship with Him and with others. “If we
confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our
sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).

God’s compassion and faithfulness are new every morning (Lam. 3:23),
so we can start afresh each day.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You for this new day, Lord. Forgive me for doing those things in
the past that I shouldn't have done, and for not doing those things
that I should have done. Set my feet on Your right path today.

Each new day gives us new reasons to praise the Lord.
