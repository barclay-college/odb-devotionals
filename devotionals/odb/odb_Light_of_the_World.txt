Light of the World

Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and
opens the door, I will come in.
Revelation 3:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 3:14–22

One of my favorite pieces of art hangs in the Keble College chapel in
Oxford, England. The painting, The Light of the World by English
artist William Holman Hunt, shows Jesus holding a lantern in His hand
and knocking on a door to a home.

One of the intriguing aspects of the painting is that the door doesn’t
have a handle. When questioned about the lack of a way to open the
door, Hunt explained that he wanted to represent the imagery of
Revelation 3:20, “Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone
hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in.”

The apostle John’s words and the painting illustrate the kindness of
Jesus. He gently knocks on the door of our souls with His offer of
peace. Jesus stands and patiently waits for us to respond. He does not
open the door Himself and force His way into our lives. He does not
impose His will on ours. Instead, He offers to all people the gift of
salvation and light to guide us.

To anyone who opens the door, He promises to enter. There are no other
requirements or prerequisites.

If you hear the voice of Jesus and His gentle knock on the door of
your soul, be encouraged that He patiently waits for you and will
enter if you welcome Him in.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for the gift of salvation and Your promise to enter
when we open the door. Please help me to respond to this gift and open
the door for You today.

Open the door to Jesus; He is patiently waiting for you.
