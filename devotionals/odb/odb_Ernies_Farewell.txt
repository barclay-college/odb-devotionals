Ernie’s Farewell

Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.

2 Corinthians 6:2

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:21-23

On September 30, 2009, columnist Mitch Albom sat on stage at the Fox
Theater in Detroit, Michigan, to interview Ernie Harwell, one of the
most beloved men in American sports. Harwell spent more than 50 years
as a radio play-by-play announcer, mostly for the Detroit Tigers
baseball team. His kindness, humility, and warmth as a broadcaster
left an indelible impression on all who met him.

When Albom interviewed him, Ernie was 91 years old and had just
announced that he had incurable cancer. But as Ernie talked, he wasn’t
about to let people feel sorry for him. Instead, he wanted to talk
about the night in 1961 when he trusted Jesus Christ as Savior. And,
during one of the final times this Hall of Fame announcer would be
able to speak publicly, he concluded, “I don’t know how many days I’ve
got left . . . [but] I can really know . . . whose arms I’m going to
end up in, and what a great, great thing heaven is going to be.”

Ernie was anticipating something special! He knew that God had a
glorious eternal home prepared for him (John 14:2-3; Phil. 1:21-23),
so he could look death in the face and praise God. Is that your
confidence? Do you know that His arms are waiting to welcome you home?
At the end, that’s really all that matters.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, when I take my final breath And see You face to face in death,
Then shall my heart forever sing The heavenly praises of my King.
—Raniville

For the Christian, death means heaven, happiness, and Him.
