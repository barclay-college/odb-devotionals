Purge Out The Old

Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly
are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for
us. —
1 Corinthians 5:7

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 5

Several days before their New Year celebration, many Chinese families
give their home a thorough cleaning. There’s a Cantonese saying that
goes: “Wash away the dirt on ninyabaat” (28th day of month 12). They
practice this tradition because it is believed the cleaning sweeps
away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready
for good luck.

When the apostle Paul wrote to the believers at Corinth, he asked them
to give their lives a thorough cleansing—not for good luck but to
please God. He told them to “purge out the old leaven” (1 Cor. 5:7).

Paul used the Jewish feasts of Passover and Unleavened Bread (Ex.
12:1-28) as a backdrop for this statement. Leaven (yeast) was a symbol
of sin and corruption and was to be removed from Jewish homes to
celebrate these festivals (Deut. 16:3-4). Because Jesus is the
Passover Lamb who cleanses us from sin, the Corinthians were to scour
their hearts and remove the leaven of sexual immorality, malice, and
wickedness from their lives and their assembly (1 Cor. 5:9-13).

Out of gratitude to Jesus for His sacrifice, let us purge out the sin
in our lives and celebrate the holiness that only He can bring.
