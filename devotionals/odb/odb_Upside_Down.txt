Upside Down

My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways. —
Isaiah 55:8

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 55:6-13

There are a lot of things that intrigue me about Jesus. One of the
aspects of His ministry that has always produced jaw-dropping, head-
scratching responses is His upside-down teaching about life.

As we journey through life, we may get to the point where we think
we’ve got it figured out and our thought patterns and responses for
navigating through life are deeply engrained. Yet Jesus interrupts us
in the midst of our routines and calls us to a new and better way. But
beware! This encounter with the ways of Jesus will be challenging.

Consider these paradoxical propositions: to live you must die (Mark
8:35); to gain you must give (Matt. 19:21); “blessed are those who
mourn” (5:4); to rule you must serve (Luke 22:26); and suffering has
purpose (Matt. 5:10-11).

It is pronouncements like these that make people think Christ is
strangely out of touch. But we are the ones out of touch. He is not
upside down, we are! We’re like children who think they know better
than their parents what is best.

No wonder God has told us, “My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are
your ways My ways” (Isa. 55:8). So, rather than relying on our mixed-
up instincts, let’s ask Him to help us reflect His ways.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You know what is best, and You desire to lead us in paths that
are right and good. Give us the courage to trust and to follow You in
the ways of righteousness for Your name’s sake. Amen.

What may seem upside down to us is right side up to God.
