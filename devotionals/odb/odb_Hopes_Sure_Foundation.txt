Hope’s Sure Foundation

My God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory
in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 11:1–6

Lessons on faith can come from unexpected places—like the one I
learned from my 110-pound, black Labrador retriever, “Bear.” Bear’s
large metal water bowl was located in a corner of the kitchen.
Whenever it was empty, he wouldn’t bark or paw at it. Instead, he
would lie down quietly beside it and wait. Sometimes he would have to
wait several minutes, but Bear had learned to trust that I would
eventually walk into the room, see him there, and provide what he
needed. His simple faith in me reminded me of my need to place more
trust in God.

The Bible tells us that “faith is confidence in what we hope for and
assurance about what we do not see” (Hebrews 11:1). The foundation of
this confidence and assurance is God Himself, who “rewards those who
earnestly seek him” (v. 6). God is faithful to keep His promises to
all who believe and come to Him through Jesus.

Sometimes having faith in “what we do not see” isn’t easy. But we can
rest in God’s goodness and His loving character, trusting that His
wisdom is perfect in all things—even when we have to wait. He is
always faithful to do what He says: to save our eternal souls and meet
our deepest needs, now and forever.
