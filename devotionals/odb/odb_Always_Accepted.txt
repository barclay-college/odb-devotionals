Always Accepted

The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.
Luke 19:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 19:1–10

After several years of struggling to keep up in her studies, Angie was
finally taken out of her elite primary school and transferred to a
“normal” one. In Singapore’s intensely competitive education
landscape, where being in a “good” school can improve one’s future
prospects, many would see this as a failure.

Angie’s parents were disappointed, and Angie herself felt as if she
had been demoted. But soon after joining her new school, the nine year
old realized what it meant to be in a class of average students.
“Mummy, I belong here,” she said. “I’m finally accepted!”

It reminded me of how excited Zacchaeus must have felt when Jesus
invited Himself to the tax collector’s home (Luke 19:5). Christ was
interested in dining with those who knew they were flawed and didn’t
deserve God’s grace (v. 10). Having found us—and loved us—as we were,
Jesus gives us the promise of perfection through His death and
resurrection. We are made perfect through His grace alone.

I’ve often found my spiritual journey to be one of constant struggle,
knowing that my life falls far short of God’s ideal. How comforting it
is to know that we are always accepted, for the Holy Spirit is in the
business of molding us to be like Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for loving me as I am, and for making me perfect
through Your Son’s sacrifice. Teach me to submit to Your daily
renewal.

We’re not perfect, but we’re loved.
