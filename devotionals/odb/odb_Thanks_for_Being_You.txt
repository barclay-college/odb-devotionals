Thanks for Being You!

Enter his gates with thanksgiving.
Psalm 100:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 100

When I served as my mom’s live-in caregiver at a cancer center, I got
to know Lori, another caregiver who lived down the hallway from us
with her husband, Frank. I would chat, laugh, vent, cry, and pray with
Lori in the shared living areas. We enjoyed supporting each other as
we cared for our loved ones.

One day, I missed the free shuttle that took residents to buy
groceries. Lori offered to drive me to the store later that evening.
With grateful tears, I accepted her offer. “Thanks for being you,” I
said. I truly appreciated her for who she was as a person, not just
for what she did for me as a friend.

Psalm 100 demonstrates an appreciation of God for who He is, not
simply for all He does. The psalmist invites “all the earth” (v. 1) to
“worship the Lord with gladness” (v. 2), being confident in knowing
“the Lord is God” (v. 3). Our Maker invites us into His presence to
“give thanks to him and praise his name” (v. 4). Yes, the Lord remains
worthy of our ongoing thankfulness because He “is good,” His “love
endures forever,” and His “faithfulness continues through all
generations” (v. 5).

God will always be the Creator and Sustainer of the universe and our
intimately loving Father. He deserves our genuine joy-filled
gratitude.
