Unexpected

Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life
for my sake will find it.
Matthew 10:39

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 10:35–42

In the midday heat of summer, while traveling in the American South,
my wife and I stopped for ice cream. On the wall behind the counter we
saw a sign reading, “Absolutely No Snowmobiling.” The humor worked
because it was so unexpected.

Sometimes saying the unexpected has the most effect. Think of this in
regard to a statement by Jesus: “Whoever finds their life will lose
it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it” (Matt.
10:39). In a kingdom where the King is a servant (Mark 10:45), losing
your life becomes the only way to find it. This is a startling message
to a world focused on self-promotion and self-protection.

In practical terms, how can we “lose our life”? The answer is summed
up in the word sacrifice. When we sacrifice, we put into practice
Jesus’s way of living. Instead of grasping for our own wants and
needs, we esteem the needs and well-being of others.

Jesus not only taught about sacrifice but He also lived it by giving
Himself for us. His death on the cross became the ultimate expression
of the heart of the King who lived up to His own words: “Greater love
has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends” (John
15:13).

Reflect & Pray

Loving Father, teach me the heart of Christ, that I might more fully
appreciate the sacrifice He has made for me and be willing to
sacrifice myself for others.

Nothing is really lost by a life of sacrifice.  Henry Liddon
