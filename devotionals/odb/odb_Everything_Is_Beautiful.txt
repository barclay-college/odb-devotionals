Everything Is Beautiful

I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten. —
Joel 2:25

Today's Scripture: Joel 2:18-27

The beauty of the black lacy design against the pastel purple and
orange background grabbed my attention. The intricacy of the fragile
pattern led me to assume that it had been created by a skilled artist.
As I looked more closely at the photo, however, I saw the artist
admiring his work from a corner of the photo. The “artist” was a worm,
and its work of art was a partially eaten leaf.

What made the image beautiful was not the destruction of the leaf but
the light glowing through the holes. As I gazed at the photo, I began
thinking about lives that have been eaten by the “worms” of sin. The
effects are ravaging. Sin eats away at us as we suffer the
consequences of our own bad choices or those of others. We are all its
victims.

But the photo also reminded me of the hope we have in God. Through the
prophet Joel, God said to Israel, “I will restore to you the years
that the swarming locust has eaten” (Joel 2:25). And from Isaiah we
learn that the Lord appointed him to “console those who mourn in Zion,
to give them beauty for ashes” (Isa. 61:3).

Satan does everything he can to make us ugly, but the Light of the
World can make us beautiful—despite Satan’s best efforts.

Reflect & Pray

Sin ravages a fruitful life When it is not addressed; But God restores
and makes us right Once sin has been confessed. —Sper

God doesn’t remove all of our imperfections, but He makes us beautiful
by shining through them.
