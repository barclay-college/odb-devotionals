Ant World

—
2 Timothy 4:10

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 4:9-18

One of the highlights of my work as a college president is
commencement. One year, while walking to the graduation ceremony, I
was excited by the thought that our graduates were ready to go out to
engage the world with the transforming power of the kingdom of Christ.
On my way, I noticed some industrious ants busily going about their
routine. I thought, There are much greater things happening than the
building of sand piles!

It’s easy for us to get lost in “ant world”—to be so busy with our
routines that we miss the joy of personally embracing the bigger
picture of God’s great work around the world. The work of the Spirit
is sweeping across South America, thousands in Africa are coming to
know Christ daily, persecuted Christians are thriving, and the Asian
Rim is throbbing with the pulse of the gospel! Do those thoughts ever
capture your heart? Your prayer life? Your checkbook?

Our preoccupation with lesser things reminds me of Paul’s report that
“Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world” (2 Tim.
4:10). I wonder if Demas regretted abandoning the gospel for the sand
piles of this world?

Let’s get out of “ant world” and engage our hearts and lives in
spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I love You and want to be a part of Your work around the world.
Give me an open heart to know which opportunities You want me to be a
part of and wisdom in knowing how to carry that out. Amen.

Don’t let smaller things distract you from the bigger work of God
around the world.
