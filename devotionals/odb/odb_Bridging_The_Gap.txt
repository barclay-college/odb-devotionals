Bridging The Gap

The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. —
John 1:14

Today's Scripture: John 1:10-18

When my kids were young, I thought they would be impressed with what
few accomplishments I may have had—that they would read my books and
be impressed by my speaking engagements. But then I discovered that
they hadn’t read any of my books and had no idea where I had been on a
speaking gig. When my oldest son finally read one of my books, he told
me that the only reason he read it was so that I would stop telling
people that my children have never read my books!

Let’s face it—for the most part, kids are not impressed with our
accomplishments. So the only way to bridge the gap is to meet them
where they are, to get into their world—like getting into a game of
Chutes and Ladders or playing catch in the backyard.

Jesus did this with us. John said of Jesus, “the Word became flesh and
dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory” (John 1:14). In other words,
He stooped down to our level when He came to this earth, which led to
His greatest accomplishment of all: bridging the gap between His world
and ours once and for all. Only then could we begin to understand how
worthy He is of our utmost adoration and praise!

Reflect & Pray

Our Lord is worthy all our days Of all our love and highest praise; He
died to take our sin and shame— Oh, bless the Savior’s holy name!

Jesus bridged the gap between the infinite God and finite man.
