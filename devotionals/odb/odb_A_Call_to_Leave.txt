A Call to Leave

At once they left their nets and followed him.
Matthew 4:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 4:18–22

As a young woman, I imagined myself married to my high school
sweetheart—until we broke up. My future yawned emptily before me and I
struggled with what to do with my life. At last I sensed God leading
me to serve Him by serving others and enrolled in seminary. Then the
reality crashed through that I’d be moving away from my roots,
friends, and family. In order to respond to God’s call, I had to
leave.

Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee when He saw Peter and his
brother Andrew casting nets into the sea, fishing for a living. He
invited them to “Come, follow me . . . and I will send you out to fish
for people” (Matthew 4:19). Then Jesus saw two other fishermen, James
and his brother John, and offered them a similar invitation (v. 21).

When these disciples came to Jesus, they also left something. Peter
and Andrew “left their nets” (v. 20). James and John “left the boat
and their father and followed him” (v. 22). Luke puts it this way: “So
they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him”
(Luke 5:11).

Every call to Jesus also includes a call from something else. Net.
Boat. Father. Friends. Home. God calls all of us to a relationship
with Himself. Then He calls each of us to serve.

Reflect & Pray

How could God’s call to follow Him also call you from something else?
In what ways can you trust Him with what you may be leaving?

Loving God, help me understand what I might need to leave in order to
respond to Your call.
