Waiting with the Turtle

I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry.
Psalm 40:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 40:1–5, 14–17

Every fall, when the painted turtle senses winter coming, she dives to
the bottom of her pond, burying herself in the muck and mud. She pulls
into her shell and goes still: her heart rate slows, almost stopping.
Her body temperature drops, staying just above freezing. She stops
breathing, and she waits. For six months, she stays buried, and her
body releases calcium from her bones into her bloodstream, so that she
slowly begins even to lose her shape.

But when the pond thaws, she will float up and breathe again. Her
bones will reform, and she will feel the warmth of the sun on her
shell.

I think of the painted turtle when I read the psalmist’s description
of waiting for God. The psalmist is in a “slimy pit” of “mud and
mire,” but God hears him (Psalm 40:2). God lifts him out, and gives
him a firm place to stand. God is “my help and my deliverer,” he sings
(v. 17).

Perhaps it feels like you’ve been waiting forever for something to
change—for a new direction in your career, for a relationship to be
restored, for the willpower to break a bad habit, or for deliverance
from a difficult situation. The painted turtle and the psalmist are
here to remind us to trust in God: He hears, and He will deliver.

Reflect & Pray

What do you need to trust God with? What might that look like today?

God, sometimes it’s hard to wait. But we trust in You and in Your
deliverance. Please give us patience, and allow Your greatness and
glory to be evident in our lives.
