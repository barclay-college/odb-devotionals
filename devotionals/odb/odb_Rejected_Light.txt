Rejected Light

I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me
should not abide in darkness. —
John 12:46

Today's Scripture: John 12:35-46

In the early hours of December 21, 2010, I witnessed an event that
last occurred in 1638—a total lunar eclipse on the winter solstice.
Slowly the shadow of the earth slipped across the bright full moon and
made it appear a dark red. It was a remarkable and beautiful event.
Yet it reminded me that while physical darkness is part of God’s
created design, spiritual darkness is not.

Scottish pastor Alexander MacLaren said: “Rejected light is the parent
of the densest darkness, and the man who, having the light, does not
trust it, piles around himself thick clouds of obscurity and gloom.”
Jesus described this self-imposed spiritual eclipse of heart and mind
when He said, “If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how
great is that darkness!” (Matt. 6:23).

The great invitation of Christmas is to open our hearts to the Savior
who came to end our darkness. Jesus said, “While you have the light,
believe in the light, that you may become sons of light. . . . I have
come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not
abide in darkness” (John 12:36,46).

The way out of our spiritual night is to walk in the light with Him.

Reflect & Pray

Come to the Light, ’tis shining for thee, Sweetly the Light has dawned
upon me; Once I was blind, but now I can see— The Light of the world
is Jesus. —Bliss

When we walk in the Light, we won’t stumble in the darkness.
