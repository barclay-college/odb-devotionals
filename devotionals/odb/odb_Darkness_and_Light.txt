Darkness and Light

You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, . . . nor of the
pestilence that walks in darkness. —
Psalm 91:5-6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 91:1-8

When I was a boy, I delivered newspapers to about 140 homes on two
streets that were connected by a cemetery. Since I delivered a morning
newspaper, I had to be out at 3:00 a.m. walking through that cemetery
in the darkness. Sometimes I would be so frightened that I would
actually run! I was afraid until I was standing safely under a
streetlight on the other side. The scary darkness was dispelled by the
light.

The psalmist understood the connection between fear and darkness, but
he also knew that God is greater than those fears. He wrote, “You
shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that
flies by day, nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness” (Ps.
91:5-6). Neither terrors of night nor evil in the darkness need to
drive us to fear. We have a God who sent His Son, the Light of the
World (John 8:12).

In the light of God’s love and grace and truth, we can find courage,
help, and strength to live for Him.
