Praising Through Problems

Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?
Job 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 1:13–22

“It’s cancer.” I wanted to be strong when Mom said those words to me.
But I burst into tears. You never want to hear those words even one
time. But this was Mom’s third bout with cancer. After a routine
mammogram and biopsy, Mom learned that she had a malignant tumor under
her arm.

Though Mom was the one with bad news, she had to comfort me. Her
response was eye-opening for me: “I know God is always good to me.
He’s always faithful.” Even as she faced a difficult surgery, followed
up by radiation treatments, Mom was assured of God’s presence and
faithfulness.

How like Job. Job lost his children, his wealth, and his health. But
after hearing the news, Job 1:20 tells us “he fell to the ground in
worship.” When advised to curse God, he said, “Shall we accept good
from God, and not trouble?” (2:10). What a radical initial response.
Though Job later complained, ultimately he accepted that God had never
changed. Job knew that God was still with him and that He still cared.

For most of us, praise is not our first response to difficulties.
Sometimes the pain of our circumstances is so overwhelming, we lash
out in fear or anger. But watching Mom’s response reminded me that God
is still present, still good. He will help us through hard times.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, prepare me for the times when praise is most difficult to utter.

Even at our lowest point, we can lift our eyes to the Lord.
