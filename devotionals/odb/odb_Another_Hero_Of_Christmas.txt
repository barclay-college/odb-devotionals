Another Hero Of Christmas

Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a
public example, was minded to put her away secretly. —
Matthew 1:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 1:18-25

For most of my life, I missed the importance of Joseph in the
Christmas story. But after I became a husband and father myself, I had
a greater appreciation for Joseph’s tender character. Even before he
knew how Mary had become pregnant, he decided that he wasn’t going to
embarrass or punish her for what seemed to be infidelity (Matt. 1:19).

I marvel at his obedience and humility, as he not only did what the
angel told him (v.24) but also refrained from physical intimacy with
Mary until after Jesus was born (v.25). Later we learn that Joseph was
willing to flee his home to protect Jesus (2:13-23).

Imagine the pressure Joseph and Mary must have felt when they learned
that Jesus would be theirs to raise and nurture! Imagine the
complexity and pressure of having the Son of God living with you every
moment of every day; a constant call to holiness by His very presence.
What a man Joseph must have been to be trusted by God for this task!
What a wonderful example for us to follow, whether we’re raising our
own children or those born to others who are now entrusted to us.

May God grant us the strength to be faithful like Joseph, even if we
don’t fully understand God’s plan.
