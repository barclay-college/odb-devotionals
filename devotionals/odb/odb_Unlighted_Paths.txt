Unlighted Paths

The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
Joshua 1:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Joshua 1:1–9

As we ventured home from a family vacation, the road took us through
some desolate parts of central Oregon. For nearly two hours after dusk
we drove through deep canyons and across desert plateaus. Fewer than
twenty sets of headlights punctuated the darkness. Eventually the moon
rose on the horizon, visible to us when the road crested hills but
eclipsed when we traveled through the lowlands. My daughter remarked
on its light, calling it a reminder of God’s presence. I asked whether
she needed to see it to know He was there. She replied, “No, but it
sure helps.”

After Moses’s death, Joshua inherited leadership of the Israelites and
was charged to take God’s chosen people into the Promised Land.
Despite his divine commission, Joshua must have felt challenged by the
daunting nature of his task. God graciously offered Joshua assurance
to be with him on the journey ahead (Josh. 1:9).

The road of life often travels through uncharted territory. We voyage
through seasons when the path ahead isn’t clearly visible. God’s plan
may not always be apparent to us, but He has promised to be with us
“always, to the very end of the age” (Matt. 28:20). What greater
assurance could we hope for, no matter what uncertainty or challenge
we might face? Even when the path is unlit, the Light is with us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for being near me even when I cannot see You. Please
comfort me with Your presence.

God is with us even when we can’t see Him.
