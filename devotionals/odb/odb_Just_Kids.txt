Just Kids

Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers. —
1 Timothy 4:12

Today's Scripture: 1 Timothy 4:9-16

After high school, Darrell Blizzard left the orphanage where he grew
up to join the US Army Air Corps. World War II was in full swing, and
soon he faced responsibilities usually given to older and more
experienced men. He told a reporter years later that a four-mule plow
team was the biggest thing he’d driven before he became the pilot of a
four-engine B-17. Now in his late eighties, he said, “We were all just
kids flying those things.”

In the Bible, we find accounts of many people who followed God
courageously when they were young. In a situation of corrupt spiritual
leadership, “Samuel ministered before the Lord, even as a child” (1
Sam. 2:18). David faced the giant Goliath in spite of being told, “You
are not able to go against this Philistine . . . for you are a youth”
(17:33). Mary, the mother of Jesus, was most likely very young when
she was told she would bear the Son of God. She responded to the
angel’s announcement by saying, “Let it be to me according to your
word” (Luke 1:38). Paul told the young pastor Timothy, “Let no one
despise your youth, but be an example to the believers” (1 Tim. 4:12).

God values each one in His family. In His strength, the young can be
bold in their faith, while those who are older can encourage those who
are “just kids.”

Reflect & Pray

O Lord of all the upward road, Keep strong our youth, we pray; May age
and youth together seek To follow in Thy way. —Niedermeyer

Encouraging the young should never become old.
