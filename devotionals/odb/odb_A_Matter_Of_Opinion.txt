A Matter Of Opinion?

[Jesus] said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” —
Matthew 16:15

Today's Scripture: Matthew 16:13-20

We live in an age dominated by all kinds of public opinion polls.
Decisions are being driven by the crowd, and some of that is good.
Surveys can inform us about people’s experiences with products,
helping us make wiser purchases. Opinion polls can give government
officials a sense of how their policy initiatives will be received.
While information gleaned is a matter of personal opinion, it can be
helpful in shaping decision-making on a variety of levels.

But when it comes to the most important question for all eternity, a
public opinion poll cannot give us the answer. We must answer for
ourselves. In Matthew 16, Jesus took His disciples to Caesarea
Philippi and asked a question about public opinion: “Who do men say
that I, the Son of Man, am?” (v.13). The answers were varied, and all
were complimentary—but none was adequate. That’s why Jesus then asked
His disciples, “But who do you say that I am?” (v.15). Peter got the
answer right: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (v.16).

Public opinion can help answer certain questions, but not the one
question that will determine your eternity: Who do you say that Jesus
is? If you agree with Scripture, and place your trust in Christ, you
will have eternal life.

Reflect & Pray

It doesn’t matter what the crowd Believes about the Lord. What matters
is: Do you believe What God says in His Word? —Sper

Opinion is no substitute for the truth of God’s Word.
