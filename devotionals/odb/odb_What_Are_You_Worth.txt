What Are You Worth?

It was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were
redeemed . . . but with the precious blood of Christ.
1 Peter 1:18–19

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 1:17–23

There is a story that in 75 bc a young Roman nobleman named Julius
Caesar was kidnapped by pirates and held for ransom. When they
demanded 20 talents of silver in ransom (about $600,000 today), Caesar
laughed and said they obviously had no idea who he was. He insisted
they raise the ransom to 50 talents! Why? Because he believed he was
worth far more than 20 talents.

What a difference we see between Caesar’s arrogant measure of his own
worth and the value God places on each of us. Our worth is not
measured in terms of monetary value but by what our heavenly Father
has done on our behalf.

What ransom did He pay to save us? Through the death of His only Son
on the cross, the Father paid the price to rescue us from our sin. “It
was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were
redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your
ancestors, but with the precious blood of Christ” (1 Peter 1:18–19).

God loved us so much that He gave up His Son to die on the cross and
rise from the dead to ransom and rescue us. That is what you are worth
to Him.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for the love You have shown to me and for the price
You paid for my forgiveness. Help my life to be an ongoing expression
of gratitude, for You are the One whose worth is beyond measure.

Our worth is measured by what God paid to rescue us.
