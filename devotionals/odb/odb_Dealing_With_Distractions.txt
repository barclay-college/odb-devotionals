Dealing With Distractions

The cares of this world . . . choke the word. —
Matthew 13:22

Today's Scripture: Matthew 13:14-22

A restaurant owner in the village of Abu Ghosh, just outside
Jerusalem, offered a 50-percent discount for patrons who turned off
their cell phones. Jawdat Ibrahim believes that smartphones have
shifted the focus of meals from companionship and conversation to
surfing, texting, and business calls. “Technology is very good,”
Ibrahim says. “But . . . when you are with your family and your
friends, you can just wait for half an hour and enjoy the food and
enjoy the company.”

How easily we can be distracted by many things, whether in our
relationship with others or with the Lord.

Jesus told His followers that spiritual distraction begins with hearts
that have grown dull, ears that are hard of hearing, and eyes that are
closed (Matt. 13:15). Using the illustration of a farmer scattering
seed, Jesus compared the seed that fell among thorns to a person who
hears God’s Word but whose heart is focused on other things. “The
cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word,
and he becomes unfruitful” (v.22).

There is great value in having times throughout each day when we turn
off the distractions of mind and heart and focus on the Lord.

Reflect & Pray

O Lord, help me to turn off all the distractions around me and focus
on You. May my heart be good soil for the seed of Your Word today.

Focusing on Christ puts everything else in perspective.
