A Multiplied Love

Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.
1 John 4:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:20–5:5

When a woman in Karen’s church was diagnosed with ALS (amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), things looked
bad. This cruel disease affects nerves and muscles, eventually leading
to paralysis. The family’s insurance wouldn’t cover home care, and the
stricken woman’s husband couldn’t bear the thought of putting her in a
nursing home.

As a nurse, Karen had the expertise to help and began going to the
woman’s home to care for her. But she soon realized she couldn’t take
care of her own family while meeting the needs of her friend, so she
started teaching others in the church to help. As the disease ran its
course over the next seven years, Karen trained thirty-one additional
volunteers who surrounded that family with love, prayer, and practical
assistance.

“Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister,” said
John the disciple (1 John 4:21). Karen gives us a shining example of
that kind of love. She had the skills, compassion, and vision to rally
a church family around a hurting friend. Her love for one person in
need became a multiplied love lived out by many.
