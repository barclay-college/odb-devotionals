Call It Good?

I have trusted in Your mercy. —
Psalm 13:5

Today's Scripture: Psalm 13

Can we really know whether to label life’s circumstances as good or
bad?

For instance, your car breaks down right before you are to take a
family road trip. But when you take the car to the shop, the mechanic
says, “Good thing you didn’t take this out on the road. It could have
caught fire.” Is that bad because of the inconvenience, or good
because of God’s protection?

Or perhaps your child decides to pursue interests that aren’t all that
interesting to you. You wanted her to play basketball and run track in
high school. But she wanted to sing and play the oboe. You feel
frustrated, but she excels and ends up with a music scholarship. Is
that bad because your dreams weren’t fulfilled, or good because God
directed her in ways you could not have predicted?

Sometimes it’s hard to see how God is working. His mysteries don’t
always reveal their secrets to us, and our journey is often redirected
by uncontrollable detours. Perhaps God is showing us a better route.

To make sure we benefit from what might seem bad, we must recognize
and trust God’s “unfailing love” (Ps. 13:5 NIV). In the end, we’ll be
able to say, “I will sing to the Lord, for He has been good to me”
(v.6 NIV).

Reflect & Pray

The circumstances in our lives Seem random and unplanned; But someday
we will surely see The order of God’s hand. —Sper

We may not be able to control events, but we can control our attitude
toward them.
