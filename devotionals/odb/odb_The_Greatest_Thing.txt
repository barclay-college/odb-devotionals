The Greatest Thing

Mary . . . sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word. —
Luke 10:39

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 10:38-42

During a church service I spotted an infant several rows ahead. As the
baby peeked over his father’s shoulder, his eyes were wide with wonder
as he looked at the members of the congregation. He grinned at some
people, drooled, and chewed his chunky fingers, but never quite found
his thumb. The pastor’s words grew distant as my eyes kept sliding
back to that sweet baby.

Distractions come in all shapes and sizes. For Martha, distraction
took the form of cooking and cleaning—trying to serve Christ instead
of listening to Him and talking with Him. Mary refused to be
sidetracked. “Mary . . . sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word” (Luke
10:39). When Martha grumbled because Mary wasn’t helping her, Jesus
said, “Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away
from her” (v. 42 niv).

Jesus’ words remind us that our relationship with Him is more
important than any of the good things that might temporarily capture
our attention. It has been said that good things are the enemies of
great things. For followers of Jesus, the greatest thing in this life
is to know Him and to walk with Him.

Reflect & Pray

What do you think Martha’s distractions were? Was she wanting to be
seen as a good host? Or was she jealous of her sister? What attitudes
cause you not to make Jesus your top priority?

Teach me, Lord, to get to know You, for that’s when I’ll learn to love
You more than anything.
