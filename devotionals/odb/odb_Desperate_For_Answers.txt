Desperate For Answers

When you come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you
shall not learn to follow the abominations of those nations. —
Deuteronomy 18:9

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 18:9-14

A popular afternoon television program a few years ago was hosted by a
self-proclaimed medium. He supposedly received messages from spirits
of the dead to give to their family members in his studio audience.
His readings prompted many people to believe in this occultic
practice.

We live in a culture where people are desperate to know their future,
and they’ll turn to psychics and mediums for answers—a practice
expressly forbidden in the Scriptures.

The ancient Israelites were desperate to know their future, and God
knew that they would be tempted to consult ungodly sources for
answers. So He warned them to stay away from mediums and those who
contact the dead (Lev. 19:26,31; 20:27; Deut. 18:9-14).

God knew that these practices would prevent ancient Israel from being
a holy, set-apart people who would be a blessing to all nations. The
future for Israel was determined by their faithfulness to God’s
covenant, not the words of soothsayers and psychics. Reliance on these
evil practices indicated a failure to trust the Lord with their lives.

When you are desperate for information about your future, turn to the
sovereign God of heaven. He is the only One who holds the answers you
seek.
