Praise in the Dark

Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice
of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name.
Hebrews 13:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 26:17–30

Even though my friend Mickey was losing his eyesight, he told me, “I’m
going to keep praising God every day, because He’s done so much for
me.”

Jesus gave Mickey, and us, the ultimate reason for such never-ending
praise. The twenty-sixth chapter of Matthew tells us about how Jesus
shared the Passover meal with His disciples the night before He went
to the cross. Verse 30 shows us how they concluded the meal: “When
they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.”

It wasn’t just any hymn they sang that night—it was a hymn of praise.
For millennia, Jews have sung a group of Psalms called “The Hallel” at
Passover (hallel is the Hebrew word for “praise”). The last of these
prayers and songs of praise, found in Psalms 113–118, honors the God
who has become our salvation (118:21). It refers to a rejected stone
that became a cornerstone (v. 22) and one who comes in the name of the
Lord (v. 26). They may very well have sung, “The Lord has done it this
very day; let us rejoice today and be glad” (v. 24).

As Jesus sang with His disciples on this Passover night, He was giving
us the ultimate reason to lift our eyes above our immediate
circumstances. He was leading us in praise of the never-ending love
and faithfulness of our God.

Reflect & Pray

You are always worthy of praise, Lord, even when I don’t feel like
praising You! Help me to learn to praise You more and more.

Praising God helps us recall His goodness that never ends.
