Mayday!

When I am in distress, I call to you, because you answer me.
Psalm 86:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 86:1–13

The international distress signal “Mayday” is always repeated three
times in a row—“Mayday-Mayday-Mayday”—so the situation will be clearly
understood as a life-threatening emergency. The word was created in
1923 by Frederick Stanley Mockford, a senior radio officer at London’s
Croydon Airport. That now-closed facility once had many flights to and
from Le Bourget Airport in Paris. According to the National Maritime
Museum, Mockford coined Mayday from the French word m’aidez, which
means, “help me.”

Throughout King David’s life, he faced life-threatening situations for
which there seemed to be no way out. Yet, we read in Psalm 86 that
during his darkest hours, David’s confidence was in the Lord. “Hear my
prayer, Lord; listen to my cry for mercy.  When I am in distress, I
call to you, because you answer me” (vv. 6–7).

David also saw beyond the immediate danger by asking God to lead his
steps: “Teach me your way, Lord, that I may rely on your faithfulness;
give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name” (v. 11). When
the crisis was past, he wanted to keep walking with God.

The most difficult situations we face can become doorways to a deeper
relationship with our Lord. This begins when we call on Him to help us
in our trouble, and also to lead us each day in His way.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, even as we call to You for help today, please help us to keep
walking with You when this crisis is over.

God hears our cries for help and leads us in His way.
