The Spotlight

We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ. —
Romans 5:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:1-11

I’ll never forget the Easter Sunday in 1993 when Bernhard Langer won
the Masters golf tournament. As he stepped off the 18th green to
receive the green jacket—one of golf’s most coveted prizes—a reporter
said, “This must be the greatest day of your life!” Without missing a
beat, Langer replied: “It’s wonderful to win the greatest tournament
in the world, but it means more to win on Easter Sunday—to celebrate
the resurrection of my Lord and Savior.”

Langer had an opportunity to boast about himself, but instead he
turned the spotlight on Jesus Christ. It’s exactly what Paul was
talking about when he said, “We also rejoice [boast] in God through
our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the
reconciliation” (Rom. 5:11).

It’s easy to look for ways to draw attention to our own
accomplishments, making mental lists of things that are “cool” about
ourselves. Even Paul admitted that he had a lot to brag about—but he
considered all of it “rubbish” for the sake of knowing Christ (Phil.
3:8). We would do well to follow his example.

So, if you really want something to boast about, boast about Jesus and
what He’s done for you. Look for opportunities to turn the spotlight
on Him.

Reflect & Pray

Naught have I gotten but what I received, Grace hath bestowed it since
I have believed; Boasting excluded, pride I abase— I’m only a sinner
saved by grace! —Gray

You can’t boast in Jesus while you’re preoccupied with yourself.
