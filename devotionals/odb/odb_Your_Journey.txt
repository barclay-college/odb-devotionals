Your Journey

I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
John 14:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:15-21

I grew up in the rebellious 1960s and turned my back on religion. I
had attended church all my life but didn’t come to faith until my
early twenties after a terrible accident. Since that time, I have
spent my adult years telling others of Jesus’s love for us. It has
been a journey.

Certainly “a journey” describes life in this broken world. On the way
we encounter mountains and valleys, rivers and plains, crowded
highways and lonely roads—highs and lows, joys and sorrows, conflict
and loss, heartache and solitude. We can’t see the road ahead, so we
must take it as it comes, not as we wish it would be.

The follower of Christ, however, never faces this journey alone. The
Scriptures remind us of the constant presence of God. There is nowhere
we can go that He is not there (Ps. 139:7–12). He will never leave us
or forsake us (Deut. 31:6; Heb. 13:5). Jesus, after promising to send
the Holy Spirit, told His disciples, “I will not leave you as orphans;
I will come to you” (John 14:18).

The challenges and opportunities we face on our journey can be met
confidently, for God has promised us His never-failing presence.

Reflect & Pray

Loving Lord, thank You that You not only know the path I take, You
walk it with me. Help me to rely on Your presence, help, and wisdom
every day of my journey through life.

Faith never knows where it is being led, but it loves and knows the
One who is leading. Oswald Chambers, My Utmost for His Highest.
