Christ In The Storm

Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith? —
Mark 4:40

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 4:33-41

At the age of 27, Rembrandt painted the seascape Christ in the Storm
on the Sea of Galilee based on the story in Mark 4. With its
distinctive contrast of light and shadow, Rembrandt’s painting shows a
small boat threatened with destruction in a furious storm. As the
disciples struggle against the wind and waves, Jesus is undisturbed.
The most unusual aspect, however, is the presence in the boat of a
13th disciple whom art experts say resembles Rembrandt himself.

Mark’s gospel describes the disciples’ vivid lesson about who Jesus is
and what He can do. While they were frantically trying to save a
sinking boat, Jesus was asleep. Didn’t He care that they were all
about to die? (v.38). After Jesus calmed the storm (v.39), He asked
the penetrating question, “Why are you so fearful? How is it that you
have no faith?” (v.40). Then they were even more afraid, exclaiming to
each other, “Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey
Him!” (v.41).

We could also put ourselves in this story and discover, just as Jesus’
disciples did, that to each person who trusts in Jesus Christ, He
reveals His presence, compassion, and control in every storm of life.

Reflect & Pray

Be still, my heart; for faithful is thy Lord, And pure and true and
tried His holy Word; Though stormy flood which rageth as the sea, His
promises thy stepping-stones shall be. —Anon.

God is a safe dwelling place in life’s storms.
