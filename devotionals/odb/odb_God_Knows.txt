God Knows

Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
Matthew 6:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:1–4

When Denise met a hurting young woman in her church, her heart went
out to her and she decided to see if she could help. Every week she
spent time counseling her and praying with her. Denise became her
mentor. However, some church leaders didn’t notice Denise’s efforts
and decided to assign a church staff member to mentor the woman. No
one, they commented, seemed to be taking care of her.

While she was not expecting any credit, Denise couldn’t help but feel
a little discouraged. “It’s as if I wasn’t doing anything at all,” she
told me.

One day, however, the young woman told Denise how grateful she was for
her comfort. Denise felt encouraged. It was as if God was telling her,
“I know you’re there for her.” Denise still meets with the woman
regularly.

Sometimes, we feel unappreciated when our efforts don’t get
recognized. Scripture, however, reminds us that God knows what we’re
doing. He sees what others don’t. And it pleases Him when we serve for
His sake—not for man’s praise.

Perhaps that’s why Jesus gave us an example by telling us to do our
giving “in secret,” so that “your Father, who sees what is done . . .
will reward you” (Matt. 6:4). We need not look to others for
recognition and praise; we can take heart that God knows when we’re
faithful in serving Him and others.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, forgive me for the times when I crave others’ recognition and
praise. Help me to serve for Your glory alone.

God sees everything we do for Him.
