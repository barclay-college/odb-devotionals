Bring Your Boats

Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your
power to act.
Proverbs 3:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 3:21–31

Hurricane Harvey brought catastrophic flooding to eastern Texas in
2017. The onslaught of rain stranded thousands of people in their
homes, unable to escape the floodwaters. In what was dubbed the “Texas
Navy,” many private citizens brought boats from other parts of the
state and nation to help evacuate stranded people.

The actions of these valiant, generous men and women call to mind the
encouragement of Proverbs 3:27, which instructs us to help others
whenever we are able. They had the power to act on behalf of those in
need by bringing their boats. And so they did. Their actions
demonstrate a willingness to use whatever resources they had at their
disposal for the benefit of others.

We may not always feel adequate for the task at hand; often we become
paralyzed by thinking we don’t have the skills, experience, resources,
or time to help others. In such instances, we’re quick to sideline
ourselves, discounting what we do have that might be of assistance to
someone else. The Texas Navy couldn’t stop the floodwaters from
rising, nor could they legislate government aid. But they used what
they had within their power—their boats—to come alongside the deep
needs of their fellow man. May we all bring our “boats”—whatever they
may be—to take the people in our paths to higher ground.
