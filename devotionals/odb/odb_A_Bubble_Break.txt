A Bubble Break

We fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.
2 Corinthians 4:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 4:7–18

A young boy showered my husband, Carl, and me with bubbles as he came
running by us on the Atlantic City boardwalk. It was a light and fun
moment on a difficult day. We had come to the city to visit our
brother-in-law in the hospital and to help Carl’s sister who was
struggling and having trouble getting to her doctors’ appointments. So
as we took a break and walked along the seaside boardwalk we were
feeling a bit overwhelmed by the needs of our family.

Then came the bubbles. Just bubbles blown at us whimsically by a
little boy in the ocean breeze—but they had a special significance to
me. I love bubbles and keep a bottle in my office to use whenever I
need the smile of a bubble break. Those bubbles and the vast Atlantic
Ocean reminded me of what I can count on: God is always close. He is
powerful. He always cares. And He can use even the smallest
experiences, and briefest moments, to help us remember that His
presence is like an ocean of grace in the middle of our heavy moments.

Maybe one day our troubles will seem like bubbles—momentary in light
of eternity for “what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is
eternal” (2 Cor. 4:18).
