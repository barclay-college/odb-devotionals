The Art of Forgiveness

While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled
with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him
and kissed him.
Luke 15:20

Today's Scripture: Luke 15:11–24

One afternoon I spent two hours at an art exhibit—The Father & His Two
Sons: The Art of Forgiveness—in which all of the pieces were focused
on Jesus’s parable of the prodigal son (see Luke 15:11–31). I found
Edward Riojas’s painting The Prodigal Son especially powerful. The
painting portrays the once wayward son returning home, wearing rags
and walking with his head down. With a land of death behind him, he
steps onto a pathway where his father is already running toward him.
At the bottom of the painting are Jesus’s words, “But when he was yet
a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion” (v. 20 kjv ).

I was deeply moved by realizing once more how God’s unchanging love
has altered my life. When I walked away from Him, He didn’t turn His
back, but kept looking, watching, and waiting. His love is undeserved
yet unchanging; often ignored yet never withdrawn.

We all are guilty, yet our heavenly Father reaches out to welcome us,
just as the father in this story embraced his wayward son. “Let’s have
a feast and celebrate,” the father told the servants. “For this son of
mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found” (vv.
23–24).

The Lord still rejoices over those who return to Him today—and that’s
worth celebrating!

Reflect & Pray

Father, as we receive Your love and forgiveness, may we also extend it
to others in Your name.

God’s love for us is undeserved yet unchanging.
