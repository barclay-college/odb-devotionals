Ring in a Dumpster

Seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
Matthew 7:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 13:44–46

In college, I woke up one morning to find Carol, my roommate, in a
panic. Her signet ring was missing. We searched everywhere. The next
morning we found ourselves picking through a dumpster.

I ripped open a trash bag. “You’re so dedicated to finding this!”

“I’m not losing a two-hundred-dollar ring!” she exclaimed.

Carol’s determination reminds me of the parable Jesus told about the
kingdom of heaven, which “is like treasure hidden in a field. When a
man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all
he had and bought that field” (Matthew 13:44). Certain things are
worth going great lengths to find.

Throughout the Bible, God promises that those who seek Him will find
Him. In Deuteronomy, He explained to the Israelites that they would
find Him when they turned from their sin and sought Him with all their
hearts (4:28–29). In the book of 2 Chronicles, King Asa gained
encouragement from a similar promise (15:2). And in Jeremiah, God gave
the same promise to the exiles, saying He would bring them back from
captivity (29:13–14).

If we seek God, through His Word, worship, and in our daily lives, we
will find Him. Over time, we’ll know Him on a deeper level. That will
be even better than the sweet moment when Carol pulled her ring out of
that trash bag!

Lord, help me to seek You with all my heart.

To find God, we must be willing to seek Him.
