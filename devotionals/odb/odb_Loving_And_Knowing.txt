Loving And Knowing

God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still
sinners, Christ died for us. —
Romans 5:8

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:6-11

In a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, one of the characters, speaking of
New York’s Empire State Building, said, “I know this building because
I love this building.”

That statement caused me to think about the relationship between love
and knowledge. Whenever we love something, we want to know everything
about it. When we love a place, we want to explore every inch of it.
When we love a person, we want to know every detail of his or her
life. We want to know what he likes, how she spends her time, where he
grew up, who her friends are, what he believes. The list is endless.
But some of us want to be loved without allowing ourselves to be
known. We’re afraid that we won’t be loved if we are truly known.

We don’t have to worry about that with God. His love is far superior
to ours: “God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8). Furthermore, He
makes Himself known to us. Through creation, Scripture, and Christ,
God reveals His character and His love. Because God loves us in spite
of our imperfections, we can safely confess our faults to Him. With
God, we need not fear being known. That’s why to know God is to love
Him.

Reflect & Pray

Be still and know that He is God For pathways steep and rough, Not
what He brings, but what He is Will always be enough. —Anon.

There is no greater joy than to know that God loves us.
