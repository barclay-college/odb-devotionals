The Blackness Of Midnight

They are . . . wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of
darkness forever. —
Jude 12-13

Today's Scripture: Revelation 20

When I was a young boy, our family visited an old abandoned copper
mine. Having descended into the mine, our guide suddenly turned off
his flashlight and we were enveloped by an oppressive blackness. It
seemed as though we could feel the darkness.

Through the years, the memory of our descent into that pit has
reminded me again and again of Jesus’ words concerning the lost, who
are “cast out into outer darkness” (Matthew 8:12). As terrifying as it
was to be in that cave for just a few moments, imagine what it would
be like for eternity!

We don’t hear much about hell these days. But that doesn’t mean there
is no such place.

Have you ever thought about where you will spend eternity? According
to the Scriptures, you will spend it in one of two places—either
heaven or hell.

If you have never made sure of heaven, why not pray something like
this right now: “Lord Jesus, I believe that You died on the cross for
my sins and rose again from the dead. I now receive You as my Savior.
I don’t want to be lost. I want to go to heaven. Save me!”

Jesus promised, “The one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out”
(John 6:37).

Reflect & Pray

Be not afraid of the darkness— Even the darkness of night; Trusting in
Christ brings salvation— You will be walking in light. —Hess

Every sinner must be pardoned or punished.
