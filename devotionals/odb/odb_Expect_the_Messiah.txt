Expect the Messiah

“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary?”
Matthew 13:55

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 13:53–58

The repairman looked young—too young to fix our problem, a car that
wouldn’t start. “He’s just a kid,” my husband, Dan, whispered to me,
showing his doubt. His disbelief in the young man sounded like the
grumbling in Nazareth where citizens doubted who Jesus was.

“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son?” they asked (Matthew 13:55) when
Jesus taught in the synagogue. Scoffing, they were surprised to hear
that someone they knew was healing and teaching, and asked, “Where did
this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” (v. 54).
Instead of trusting in Jesus, they were offended by the authority He
displayed (vv. 15, 58).

In this same way, we may struggle to trust in our Savior’s wisdom and
power, especially in the familiar and ordinary details of our daily
lives. Failing to expect His help, we may miss out on the wonder of
His life transforming our own (v. 58).

As Dan found, the help he needed stood right in front of him. Finally
agreeing to accept the young man’s aid, my husband allowed him to look
at our old car’s battery. By switching just one bolt, the mechanic had
the car running in seconds—engine humming and lights ablaze. “It lit
up like Christmas,” Dan said.

So too may we expect and experience the Messiah bringing fresh light,
life, and help into our daily journey with Him.
