Garlic And Sapphires

If you show partiality, you commit sin. —
James 2:9

Today's Scripture: James 2:1-9

In her fascinating book Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a
Critic in Disguise, Ruth Reichl reflects on her 6 years as a New York
Times restaurant critic. Because she was the most influential critic
in the country, top restaurants posted her photograph so their
employees could recognize her. Hoping to earn a high rating in the New
York Times, the staff intended to provide her with their top service
and best cuisine.

In response, Reichl developed a clever strategy. Hoping to be treated
as a regular patron, she disguised herself. On one occasion, she
dressed up as an old woman. The restaurant made her wait a long time
to be seated and then was unresponsive to her requests.

In the early church, James spoke out against favoritism: “[If] you pay
attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, ‘You sit
here in a good place,’ and say to the poor man, ‘You stand there,’ or,
‘Sit here at my footstool,’ have you not shown partiality among
yourselves?” (2:3-4).

When people attend our churches, are they treated impartially? Or do
we show favoritism to the wealthy or elite? God calls us to show
concern for and interest in all people, regardless of their social
status. Let’s welcome all to join us in worshiping the King!

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, You welcomed us into Your kingdom, not because of who we
are but because of who You are— our loving and merciful God. Help us
to open our arms of fellowship to all who enter in. Amen.

God lets us into His fellowship. Who are we to keep others out?
