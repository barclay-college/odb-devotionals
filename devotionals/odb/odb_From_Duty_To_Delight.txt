From Duty To Delight

I will delight myself in Your commandments, which I love. —
Psalm 119:47

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:41-48

Because of my wife’s busy schedule, sometimes she can commit only a
limited amount of time every week to each of our grandchildren. When
possible, however, she will rearrange her schedule to spend more time
with them—not out of duty, but because she loves them. When I see her
with them, I understand what the word delight means.

In Psalm 119, the psalmist tells of his “delight” in God’s Word. He
uses the word delight eight times (vv.16,24, 35,47,70,77,92,174). He
says: “I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your
Word. . . . I will delight myself in Your commandments, which I love”
(vv.16,47). The psalmist’s words, “I will delight,” indicate that it
is a deliberate act of his will. However, it is not a burden for him
to delight in God’s Word because he loves it. His close relationship
with God created in him a desire to know what his Beloved had to say.

In the same way, for us to move from duty to delight in God’s Word, we
need to strengthen our relationship with Him. When we remember how
much He loves and cherishes us, we will respond with love and we will
delight to spend time with Him. “Oh, how I love Your law! It is my
meditation all the day” (v.97).

Then let me love my Bible more And take a fresh delight By day to read
these wonders o’er And meditate by night. —Watts

Whether morning, noon, or night, make God’s Word your delight.
