My Way?

There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of
death. —
Proverbs 16:25

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 16:20-25

Think about the worst intellectual matchups possible. For instance,
what if we put Albert Einstein in a room with a first-grader to debate
the theory of relativity? Or how about George Washington Carver versus
a middle-schooler discussing biochemical engineering?

It’s silly to think of putting these pairs together for discussions.
One is the ultimate expert; the other would know little if anything
about the topic.

Here’s another one: God versus anyone arguing about His plan for
mankind. Now we’re talking mismatch! Yet we often hear of people
trying to explain away God’s matchless wisdom and how their way is
better than His.

I received a letter from a man in prison who said: “I came to the
point in my life where I finally accepted the fact that God is real
and the Creator of everything. I grew tired of trying to do things my
way. When I started humbling myself and accepting God’s Word, I found
the answer.”

How ridiculous to reject God’s plan of salvation because we think we
know better! Only by placing our trust in Christ for the forgiveness
of our sins can we be reconciled to God (John 14:6; Rom 3:23; 6:23).
Are you still trying to do things your own way, thinking you know
best? (Prov. 16:25). Agree with God and go His way.

Reflect & Pray

There aren’t many ways into heaven; The Bible says there’s only one:
Confessing Christ Jesus as Savior, Believing in God’s only Son. —Sper

Jesus is not one of many ways to approach God, nor is He the best of
several ways; He is the only way. —Tozer
