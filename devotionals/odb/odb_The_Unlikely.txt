The Unlikely

God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things
which are mighty. —
1 Corinthians 1:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 1:25-31

Fanny Kemble was a British actress who moved to America in the early
1800s and married a southern plantation owner named Pierce Butler.
Fanny enjoyed the life afforded by the wealth of the plantation, until
she saw the cost of that luxury—a cost paid by the slaves who worked
her husband’s plantations.

Having written a memoir of the cruel treatment slaves often suffered,
Kemble was eventually divorced from her husband. Her writings were
widely circulated among abolitionists and published in 1863 as Journal
of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839. Because of her
opposition to slavery, the former wife of a slave owner became known
as “The Unlikely Abolitionist.”

In the body of Christ, God often wonderfully surprises us. He
regularly uses the unlikely—people and circumstances—to accomplish His
purposes. Paul wrote, “But God has chosen the foolish things of the
world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of
the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base
things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen”
(1 Cor. 1:27-28).

This reminds us that God, in His grace, can use anyone. If we will
allow His work to be done in us, we might be surprised at what He can
do through us!
