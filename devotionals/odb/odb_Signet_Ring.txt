Signet Ring

“I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,” declares
the Lord.
Haggai 2:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Haggai 2:15–23

When I first made the acquaintance of a new friend from abroad, I
noticed his posh English accent and that he wore a ring on his little
finger. Later I learned that this wasn’t just jewelry; it revealed his
family’s history through the family crest engraved on it.

It was a bit like a signet ring—perhaps like the one in Haggai. In
this short Old Testament book, the prophet Haggai calls for the people
of God to restart the rebuilding of the temple. They had been exiled
and had now returned to their homeland and begun rebuilding, but enemy
opposition to their project had stalled them. Haggai’s message
includes God’s promise to Zerubbabel, Judah’s leader, that he had been
chosen and set apart as their leader, like a signet ring.

In ancient times, a signet ring was used as a means of identification.
Instead of signing their name, people would press their ring into hot
wax or soft clay to make their mark. As God’s children, we too make a
mark on the world as we spread the gospel, share His grace through
loving our neighbors, and work to end oppression.

Each of us has our own unique stamp that reveals how we’re created in
God’s image and expresses our particular mix of gifts, passions, and
wisdom. It’s our call and privilege to act as this signet ring in
God’s world.

Reflect & Pray

Father God, may I know my true identity as Your heir this day. (See
Luke 15.)

We are God’s heirs and ambassadors, sharing His love in the world.
