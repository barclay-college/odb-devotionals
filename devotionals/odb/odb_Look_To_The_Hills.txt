Look To The Hills

I will lift up my eyes to the hills—from whence comes my help? My help
comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. —
Psalm 121:1-2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 121

Atop Corcovado Mountain overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, stands Christ the Redeemer, one of the tallest statues of
Christ in the world. Standing 30 meters tall, with arms spreading 28
meters, this sculpture weighs 635 metric tons. It can be seen day or
night from almost anywhere in the city. One look to the hills brings
this figure of Christ the Redeemer into view.

The New Testament tells us that Christ is not only the Redeemer, but
He is also the Creator of the universe, and that Creator is in view in
Psalm 121. There the psalmist challenges us to lift our eyes to the
hills to see God, for our “help comes from the Lord, who made heaven
and earth” (vv.1-2). He alone is sufficient to be our strength and to
guide our steps as we make our way through a dangerous and troubled
world.

We lift our eyes to the One who keeps us (v.3), guards us (vv.5-6),
and overshadows us in the face of all types of danger. He preserves us
from evil and keeps us safely in His care for all eternity (vv.7-8).

In faith, we lift our eyes to the One who is our Redeemer and Creator.
He is our help and our hope and our eternal home.

Reflect & Pray

O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Our shelter
from the stormy blast, And our eternal home! —Watts

Christ was lifted up that He might lift us up.
