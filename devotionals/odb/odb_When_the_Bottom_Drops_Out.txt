When the Bottom Drops Out

Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we
may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
Hebrews 4:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Kings 17:15–24

During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, more people were looking for
work than there were jobs available. I was one of those job seekers.
After nine anxious months, I landed employment as a copywriter. But
the company soon fell on bad times and I was jobless again.

Ever been there? It seems like the worst is over when suddenly the
bottom drops out on you. The widow at Zarephath could relate (1 Kings
17:12). Due to a famine, she was preparing the last meal for herself
and her son when the prophet Elijah requested a bite to eat. She
reluctantly agreed and God provided a continuous supply of flour and
oil (vv. 10–16).

But then her son fell ill. His health declined until he stopped
breathing. The widow cried out, “What do you have against me, man of
God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?” (v. 18).

At times, we may want to respond like the widow—wondering if God is
punishing us. We forget that bad things can happen in this fallen
world.

Elijah took the concern to God, praying earnestly and honestly for the
boy, and God raised him up! (vv. 20–22).

When the bottom drops out on us, may we—like Elijah—realize that the
faithful One will not desert us! We can rest in God’s purposes as we
pray for understanding.
