The Gift of Welcome

Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers.
Hebrews 13:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 13:1–2

The dinner where we hosted families from five nations remains a
wonderful memory. Somehow the conversation didn’t splinter into twos,
but we all contributed to a discussion of life in London from the
viewpoints of different parts of the world. At the end of the evening,
my husband and I reflected that we had received more than we gave,
including the warm feelings we experienced in fostering new
friendships and learning about different cultures.

The writer of the book of Hebrews concluded his thoughts with some
exhortations for community life, including that his readers should
continue to welcome strangers. For in doing so, “some people have
shown hospitality to angels without knowing it” (13:2). He may have
been referring to Abraham and Sarah, who as we see in Genesis 18:1–12
welcomed three strangers, reaching out to them with generosity and
treating them to a feast, as was the custom in biblical times. They
didn’t know that they were entertaining angels who brought them a
message of blessing.

We don’t ask people into our homes in the hope of gaining from them,
but often we receive more than we give. May the Lord spread His love
through us as we reach out with His welcome.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, You are the source of all that we have. May we share what we
receive, that You may be glorified.

When we practice hospitality, we share God’s goodness and gifts.
