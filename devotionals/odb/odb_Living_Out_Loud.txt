Living Out Loud

In your hearts revere Christ as Lord.
1 Peter 3:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 3:8–16

While staying at a hotel in Austin, Texas, I noticed a card lying on
the desk in my room. It said:

Welcome Our prayer is that your stay here will be restful and that
your travels will be fruitful. May the Lord bless you and keep you,
and make His face shine upon you.

This card from the company that manages the hotel made me want to know
more, so I accessed their website and read about their culture,
strength, and values. In a winsome way, they seek to pursue excellence
and live out their faith in the workplace.

Their philosophy reminded me of Peter’s words to the followers of
Jesus scattered throughout Asia Minor. He encouraged them to
demonstrate their faith in Christ in the society where they lived.
Even as they faced threats and persecution, Peter told them not to be
afraid, “But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared
to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the
hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect” (1 Peter
3:15).

A friend of mine calls this “living a lifestyle that demands an
explanation.” No matter where we live or work, may we in God’s
strength live out our faith today—always ready to reply gently and
respectfully to everyone who asks the reason for our hope.
