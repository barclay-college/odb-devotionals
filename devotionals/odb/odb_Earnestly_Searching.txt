Earnestly Searching

You will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted.
Isaiah 62:12

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 62:1–12

Every Saturday our family lines the edges of the racecourse to cheer
on my daughter as she runs with her high school cross-country team.
After crossing the finish line, the athletes stream out to rejoin
their teammates, coaches, and parents. Crowds engulf the
finishers—often more than 300 of them—making it difficult to find one
person among so many. We scan the crowd excitedly until we find her,
eager to put our arms around the one athlete we came to watch: our
much-loved daughter.

After seventy years of captivity in Babylon, God returned the Jews to
Jerusalem and Judah. Isaiah describes the delight God has in them, and
the work of preparing the highways for their pilgrimage home and the
gates to receive them back. God reaffirms His calling of them as His
holy people and restores their honor with a new name, “Sought After,
the City No Longer Deserted” (Isa. 62:12). He sought them all from the
scattered reaches of Babylon to bring them back to Himself.

Like the children of Israel, we too are God’s beloved children,
earnestly sought after by Him. Though our sin once caused us isolation
from Him, Jesus’s sacrifice paves our way back to Him. He searches for
each of us intently among all the others, waiting expectantly to fold
us into a heartfelt embrace.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for seeking me while I was lost and returning me home
to You through Jesus Christ.

God seeks His beloved children.
