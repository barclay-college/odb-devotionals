“God Saved My Life”

When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the
father of lies.
John 8:44

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 8:42–47

When Aaron (not his real name) was 15, he began praying to Satan: “I
felt like he and I had a partnership.” Aaron started to lie, steal,
and manipulate his family and friends. He also experienced nightmares:
“I woke up one morning and saw the devil at the end of the bed. He
told me that I was going to pass my exams and then die.” Yet when he
finished his exams, he lived. Aaron reflected, “It was clear to me
that he was a liar.”

Hoping to meet girls, Aaron went to a Christian festival, where a man
offered to pray for him. “While he was praying, I felt a sense of
peace flood my body.” He felt something “more powerful, and more
liberating,” than what he felt from Satan. The man who prayed told
Aaron God had a plan and Satan was a liar. This man echoed what Jesus
said of Satan when He responded to some who opposed him: “He is a liar
and the father of lies” (John 8:44).

Aaron turned to Christ from Satanism and now “belongs to God” (v. 47).
He ministers in an urban community, sharing the difference following
Jesus makes. He’s a living testament of God’s saving power: “I can say
with confidence that God saved my life.”

God is the source of all that is good, holy, and true. We can turn to
Him to find truth.
