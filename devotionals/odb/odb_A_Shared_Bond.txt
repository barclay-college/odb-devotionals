A Shared Bond

You are all one in Christ Jesus. —
Galatians 3:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:11-18

When I needed a locksmith to get into my car, I had a pleasant
surprise. After he arrived and began opening my little Ford’s door, we
began chatting and I recognized his warm, familiar accent.

It turned out that my rescuer was originally from Jamaica—a land I’ve
visited often and have grown to love. This changed a negative event
into a positive one. We were in a small way kindred spirits because of
our shared love for that beautiful island nation.

This struck me as a reminder of an even greater camaraderie—the joy of
meeting someone new and discovering that he or she is also a believer
in Christ.

In some places, this is not unusual because there are many believers.
But in those lands where there are few believers, the joy of meeting
someone else who loves Jesus must be even greater. It’s thrilling to
share together the amazing reality of the freedom from sin we have
through Christ!

For all who know Jesus, there is a shared bond, a oneness in Christ
(Gal. 3:28), a joy of fellowship that can brighten even the darkest
day. Praise God that He brings a bond of unity to all who know Him as
Savior.

Reflect & Pray

What a miracle it is, dear Lord, that You can bring together people of
all tribes, tongues, and nations to be like-minded in Christ—to share
a bond of love and affection for Jesus.

Christian fellowship builds us up and binds us together.
