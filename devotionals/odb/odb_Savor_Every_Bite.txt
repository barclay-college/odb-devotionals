Savor Every Bite

How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
—
Psalm 119:103

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:97-104

My wife Martie often tells me, “Joe, you eat too fast! Slow down and
enjoy your meal.” I’m usually done long before she is, because she
takes the time to savor every bite.

I wonder how many of us rush through reading God’s Word without really
savoring it. The psalmist said about it, “How sweet are Your words to
my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!” (Ps. 119:103). That sounds
good to me!

What are the benefits of delighting in the rich food of Scripture? A
daily meal of God’s Word helps to keep anxiety, pride, fear, and
temptation from plaguing our undernourished hearts, and strengthens us
for a victorious journey. The Word gives us wisdom and understanding
(vv.98-100). And it helps restrain our feet from evil (v.101). Just as
our digestive system distributes nutrients to our bodies, God’s Word,
when digested, nourishes our minds, our emotions, and our will.

Rather than grabbing the Word on the run just before dashing out the
door, it’s important to read it at a time and in a place where we can
really fellowship with God.

Take the time and enjoy savoring the richness of God’s Word.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, for the gift of Your Word. Please forgive us for
the times when we’ve rushed through reading without taking the time to
savor the richness of its meaning. Help us to listen to Your voice.

God’s Word provides the ingredients we need to thrive spiritually.
