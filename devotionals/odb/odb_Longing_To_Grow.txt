Longing To Grow

As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow
thereby. —
1 Peter 2:2

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 1:22–2:3

The 2010 documentary film Babies followed four infants who were born
into very different circumstances in Namibia, Mongolia, Tokyo, and San
Francisco. There is no narration or dialogue from adults in the film,
only the sounds babies make as they begin to discover the world into
which they have been born. They coo and laugh when they’re happy; they
cry when they are hurt or hungry. And all of them like milk! The
fascination of the film lies in watching them grow.

As a baby craves milk, followers of Christ are to crave the “pure milk
of the Word” that leads to spiritual growth. The apostle Peter says,
“Long to grow up into the fullness of your salvation; cry for this as
a baby cries for his milk” (1 Peter 2:2 tlb). Peter wrote to encourage
a group of Christ-followers who had been scattered by persecution. He
urged them to set aside feelings of anger and jealousy toward each
other, along with talking one way and living another (v.1), and “as
newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow
thereby” (v.2).

The Lord invites us to drink all that we need from His bountiful
supply. He loves to watch His children grow!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I want to be more like You. Please give me a fervent desire to
drink of Your Word. Grow me into a person who resembles You in all I
say and do.

The more we dig into God’s Word, the more we grow.
