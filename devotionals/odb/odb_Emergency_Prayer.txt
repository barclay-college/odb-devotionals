Emergency Prayer

Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go.
Psalm 71:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 71:1–12

On September 11, 2001, Stanley Praimnath was working on the 81st floor
of the World Trade Center South Tower when he saw an airplane flying
directly toward him. Stanley prayed a quick prayer as he dove under a
desk for protection: “Lord, I can’t do this! You take over!”

The terrible impact of the plane crash trapped Stanley behind a wall
of debris. But as he prayed and cried for help, Brian Clark, a worker
from another office, heard and responded. Making their way through
rubble and darkness, the two found their way down 80 flights of stairs
to the ground floor and out.

When encountering terrible threats, David asked God for help. He
wanted to be assured of God’s nearness as he faced enemies in battle.
In a heartfelt petition David said, “Be my rock of refuge, to which I
can always go . . . . Do not be far from me, my God; come quickly,
God, to help me” (Ps. 71:3, 12).

We aren’t promised deliverance from every difficult situation we face.
But we can be confident that God hears our prayers and will walk
alongside us through everything.

Reflect & Pray

Whatever comes my way, please come near to me, Lord, to help. I cannot
make it through anything without You. Thank You.

Nearness to God is our conscious security. A child in the dark is
comforted by grasping its father’s hand. Charles Haddon Spurgeon
