Gifts from Above

The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call
him Immanuel.
Matthew 1:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 1:18–25

According to an old story, a man named Nicholas (born in ad 270) heard
about a father who was so poor that he couldn’t feed his three
daughters, much less provide for their future marriages. Wanting to
assist the father, but hoping to keep his help a secret, Nicholas
threw a bag of gold through an open window, which landed in a sock or
shoe drying on the hearth. That man was known as St. Nicholas, who
later became the inspiration for Santa Claus.

When I heard that story of a gift coming down from above, I thought of
God the Father, who out of love and compassion sent to earth the
greatest gift, His Son, through a miraculous birth. According to
Matthew’s gospel, Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecy that a
virgin would conceive and give birth to a son whom they would call
Immanuel, meaning “God with us” (1:23).

As lovely as Nicholas’s gift was, how much more amazing is the gift of
Jesus. He left heaven to become a man, died and rose again, and is God
living with us. He brings us comfort when we’re hurting and sad; He
encourages us when we feel downhearted; He reveals the truth to us
when we might be deceived.
