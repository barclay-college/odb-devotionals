Turn Off the Scoreboard

Forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
Ephesians 4:32

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:25-32

At his son’s wedding reception, my friend Bob offered advice and
encouragement to the newlyweds. In his speech he told of a football
coach in a nearby town who, when his team lost a game, kept the losing
score on the scoreboard all week to remind the team of their failure.
While that may be a good football strategy, Bob wisely advised, it’s a
terrible strategy in marriage. When your spouse upsets you or fails
you in some way, don’t keep drawing attention to the failure. Turn off
the scoreboard.

What great advice! Scripture is full of commands for us to love each
other and overlook faults. We are reminded that love “keeps no record
of wrongs” (1 Cor. 13:5) and that we should be ready to forgive one
another “just as in Christ God forgave you” (Eph. 4:32).

I am deeply grateful that God turns off the scoreboard when I fail. He
doesn’t simply forgive when we repent; He removes our sin as far as
the east is from the west (Ps. 103:12). With God, forgiveness means
that our sin is out of sight and out of mind. May He give us grace to
extend forgiveness to those around us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for not holding my sins against me and for granting me
a second chance. Help me today to forgive others just as You have so
freely forgiven me.

Forgive as God forgives you—don’t keep score.
