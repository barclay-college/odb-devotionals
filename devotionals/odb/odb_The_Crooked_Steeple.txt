The Crooked Steeple

My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
weakness.
2 Corinthians 12:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 12:1–10

Turns out that crooked church steeples make people nervous. When we
visited some friends, they shared how, after a fierce windstorm, their
church’s proud steeple was crooked, causing some alarm.

Of course, the church quickly repaired the flagging spire, but the
humorous image got me thinking. Often church is seen as a place where
everything is expected to look perfect; it’s not seen as a place where
we can show up crooked. Right?

But in a fallen, broken world, all of us are “crooked,” each with our
own collection of natural weaknesses. We might be tempted to keep our
vulnerabilities under wraps, but Scripture encourages the opposite
attitude. In 2 Corinthians 12, for example, Paul suggests that it’s in
our weaknesses—for him, an unnamed struggle he calls a “thorn in
my flesh” (v. 7)—that Christ is most likely to reveal His power. Jesus
had told Paul, “My power is made perfect in weakness” (v. 9). So Paul
concluded, “For Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in
hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then
I am strong” (v. 10).

We may not like our imperfections, but hiding them only denies Jesus’s
power to work within those aspects of ourselves. When we invite
Jesus into the crooked places in us, He gently mends and redeems in
ways our effort could never accomplish.

Reflect & Pray

What are some of the “crooked” places in your life? In what ways have
you seen God work through your imperfections?

Invite Jesus into your imperfections for His mending.
