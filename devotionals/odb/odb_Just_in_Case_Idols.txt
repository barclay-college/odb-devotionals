Just-in-Case Idols

They have followed other gods to serve them.
Jeremiah 11:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 11:9–13

Sam checks his retirement account twice each day. He saved for thirty
years, and with the boost of a rising stock market, finally has enough
to retire. As long as stocks don’t plunge. This fear keeps Sam
worrying about his balance.

Jeremiah warned about this: “You, Judah, have as many gods as you have
towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful
god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem” (11:13).

Judah’s idolatry is remarkable. They knew the Lord was God. How could
they worship anyone else? They were hedging their bets. They needed
the Lord for the afterlife, because only the true God could raise them
from the dead. But what about now? Pagan gods promised health, wealth,
and fertility, so why not pray to them too, just in case?

Can you see how Judah’s idolatry is also our temptation? It’s good to
have talent, education, and money. But if we’re not careful, we might
shift our confidence to them. We know we’ll need God when we die, and
we’ll ask Him to bless us now. But we’ll also lean on these lesser
gods, just in case.

Where is your trust? Back-up idols are still idols. Thank God for His
many gifts, and tell Him you’re not relying on any of them. Your faith
is riding entirely on Him.

Reflect & Pray

What good thing are you tempted to turn into an idol? How might you
use this gift while still depending fully on God?

Father, all my hope is in You. Help me trust in You alone, not in my
abilities and assets.
