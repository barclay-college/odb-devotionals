Turn It Off

Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.
Mark 6:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 6:30-32,45-47

When our kids were young, we took a trip to northern Wisconsin to
visit my grandparents. They didn’t get very good reception on their
television, but TV wasn’t much of a priority with them. After I had
seen our son Scott fiddling with the TV set for a while, he asked with
frustration, “What do you do if you can get only one channel and you
don’t like what’s on that one?”

“Try turning it off, ” I said with a smile. Not exactly the advice he
was hoping for. It’s even more difficult to do now, especially when
there are so many devices that entertain, inform, and distract us.

Sometimes we do need to just turn it all off and rest our minds for a
little while; we simply need to “unplug.” Jesus often drew aside for a
time—especially when He wanted to take time to pray (Matt. 14:13). He
encouraged the disciples to step away as well—even for a brief time
(Mark 6:31). That kind of solitude and time for reflection is
beneficial for each of us. In those moments we are able to draw near
to God.

Follow the example and wisdom of Christ. Get away by yourself and
“rest a while.” It will be good for your body, mind, and spirit.
