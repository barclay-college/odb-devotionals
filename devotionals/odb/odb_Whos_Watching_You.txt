Who’s Watching You?

The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous.
Psalm 34:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:15–22

No matter where the athletes of the 2016 Olympics go in the city of
Rio de Janeiro, they can see Jesus. Standing high above this Brazilian
city and anchored to a 2,310-foot-high mountain called Corcovado is a
100-foot-tall sculpture called Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer).
With arms spread wide, this massive figure is visible day and night
from almost anywhere in the sprawling city.

As comforting as this iconic concrete and soapstone sculpture may be
to all who can look up and see it, there is much greater comfort from
this reality: The real Jesus sees us. In Psalm 34, David explained it
like this: “The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears
are attentive to their cry” (v. 15). He noted that when the righteous
call out for His help, “The Lord hears them; he delivers them from all
their troubles. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those
who are crushed in spirit” (vv. 17–18).

Just who are the righteous? Those of us who place our trust in Jesus
Christ, who Himself is our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). Our God
oversees our lives, and He hears the cries of those who trust Him. He
is near to help in our greatest times of need.

Jesus has His eyes on you.

Reflect & Pray

Sometimes, Lord, life seems out of control and I don’t know exactly
which direction to take. Thank You for overseeing my life and
prompting me in the right way through Your Word and Your Spirit.

The Lord never lets us out of His sight.
