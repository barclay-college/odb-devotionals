Imitate The Good

Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does
good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God. —
3 John 1:11

Today's Scripture: 3 John

Most people would agree that life is a painful mixture of good and
bad. It’s true in marriage, friendship, family, work, and church. Yet
we are surprised and disappointed when self-centeredness takes the
stage within a fellowship of those who seek to worship and serve
Christ together.

When the apostle John wrote to his friend Gaius, he commended the
truthful living and generous hospitality of those in his church (3
John 1:3-8). In the same fellowship, however, Diotrephes, “who wants
to be head of everything” (v.9 Phillips), had created an atmosphere of
hostility.

John promised to deal personally with Diotrephes on his next visit to
the church. In the meantime, he urged the congregation: “Beloved, do
not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of
God, but he who does evil has not seen God” (v.11). John’s words echo
the instruction of Paul to the Christians in Rome: “Do not be overcome
by evil, but overcome evil with good” (Rom. 12:21).

In a heated conflict, we may be tempted to “fight fire with fire.” Yet
John urges us to turn away from what is bad and follow what is good.
This is the pathway that honors our Savior.

Reflect & Pray

For Further Study Be patient and humble in conflicts (Rom. 12:12-21;
Gal. 6:1). Follow the guidelines in Matthew 18:15-18 with the desire
to restore erring fellow Christians.

As light overcomes darkness, goodness can overcome evil.
