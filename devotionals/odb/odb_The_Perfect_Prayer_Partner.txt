The Perfect Prayer Partner

[Jesus] is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
Romans 8:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:31–34

Few sounds are as beautiful as hearing someone who loves you praying
for you. When you hear a friend pray for you with compassion and God-
given insight, it’s a little like heaven touching earth.

How good it is to know that because of God’s kindness to us our
prayers can also touch heaven. Sometimes when we pray we may struggle
with words and feelings of inadequacy, but Jesus taught His followers
that we “should always pray and not give up” (Luke 18:1). God’s Word
shows us that one of the reasons we can do this is that Jesus Himself
“is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us” (Rom.
8:34).

We never pray alone, because Jesus is praying for us. He hears us as
we pray, and speaks to the Father on our behalf. We don’t have to
worry about the eloquence of our words, because no one understands us
like Jesus. He helps us in every way, presenting our needs before God.
He also knows when the answers we ask for would not be good for us,
handling every request or concern with perfect wisdom and love.

Jesus is the perfect prayer partner—the friend who intercedes for us
with immeasurable kindness. His prayers for us are beautiful beyond
words, and should encourage us to always pray with thankfulness.
