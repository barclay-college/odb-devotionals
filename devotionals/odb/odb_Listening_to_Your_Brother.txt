Listening to Your Brother

Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from
death and cover over a multitude of sins.
James 5:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 18:15–20

“You need to listen to me, I’m your brother!” The plea came from a
concerned older brother in my neighborhood and was directed to a
younger sibling who was moving farther away from him than the older
child was comfortable with. Clearly the older child was better able to
judge what was best in the situation.

How many of us have resisted the wise counsel of a brother or sister?
If you’ve had to face the consequences of resisting the good advice of
someone more mature, you’re not alone.

One of the greatest resources we can have as believers in Jesus is a
family—those who are spiritually related because of a common faith in
Him. This family includes mature men and women who love God and each
other. Like the little brother in my neighborhood, we sometimes need a
word of caution or correction to get us back on track. This is
particularly true when we offend someone or someone offends us. Doing
what’s right can be difficult. Yet Jesus’s words in Matthew 18:15–20
show us what to do when offenses happen within our spiritual family.

Thankfully, our gracious heavenly Father places in our lives people
who are prepared to help us honor Him and others. And when we listen,
things go better in the family (v. 15).

Reflect & Pray

Father, we praise You for placing us in Your spiritual family. Help us
to learn and grow through the wise words and godly behavior of mature
believers.

Wisdom grows when we listen to the words of mature believers.
