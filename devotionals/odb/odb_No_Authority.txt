No Authority?

Consider [the ant’s] ways and be wise, which, having no . . . ruler,
provides her supplies . . . and gathers her food. —
Proverbs 6:6-8

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 6:6-11

When the deck behind our house began caving in, I knew its repair
would exceed my abilities. So I made some calls, got some bids, and
picked a builder to construct a new deck.

Once the contractor was done, I took a close look at his work and
noticed some problems. Seeking a second opinion, I called the local
building inspector and got a surprise. The deck guy had not obtained a
building permit. Working without official oversight, he had violated
many points of the building code.

This incident reminded me of an important truth (other than asking to
see the building permit): We often do less than our best if we don’t
have any accountability to the authority over us.

In Scripture, we see this principle explained in two of Jesus’
parables (Matt. 24:45-51; 25:14-30). In both cases, at least one
unsupervised worker failed when the master was gone. But then we see a
different approach in Proverbs 6. We see the example of the ant, which
does good work without a visible supervisor. It intrinsically does its
work without being monitored.

What about us? Do we do good work only when someone is watching? Or do
we recognize that all our service is for God, and so do our best at
all times—even when no human authority is watching?

Reflect & Pray

God sees and knows the work we do: Our faithfulness He will reward;
With His authority in view, Let’s do our best for Christ the Lord.

No matter who your boss is, you are really working for God.
