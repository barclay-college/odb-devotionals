How Long?

How long, O Lord? Will You forget me forever? —
Psalm 13:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 13

For 9 long years, Saul hounded David as “one hunts a partridge in the
mountains” (1 Sam. 26:20). “How long, O Lord? Will You forget me
forever?” David prayed. “How long will You hide Your face from
me? . . . How long will my enemy be exalted over me?” (Ps. 13:1-2).

Prolonged affliction often vexes us as well. We want a sudden
solution, a quick fix. But some things can’t be fixed. They can only
be borne.

But we can complain to God in our troubles. We have a heavenly Father
who wants us to engage with Him in our struggles. He understands His
children as no one else can.

When we turn to Him with our complaints, we come to our senses. In
David’s case, his thoughts went back to life’s certainty: God’s love.
David reminded himself: “I have trusted in Your mercy; my heart shall
rejoice in Your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, because He has
dealt bountifully with me” (vv.5-6). Sufferings may persist, but David
could sing in the midst of his trials, for he was God’s beloved child.
That’s all he needed to know.

A. W. Thorold writes, “The highest pinnacle of the spiritual life is
not happy joy in unbroken sunshine, but absolute and undoubting trust
in the love of God.”

Even in our troubles, God’s love can be trusted.

Reflect & Pray

O yes, He cares; I know He cares, His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long nights dreary, I know my Savior
cares! —Graeff

God’s love stands when all else fails.
