Dumb Sheep, Good Shepherd

As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so
will I look after my sheep.
Ezekiel 34:12

Today's Scripture: Ezekiel 34:7–16

My friend Chad spent a year as a shepherd in Wyoming. “Sheep are so
dumb that they’ll only eat what is right in front of them,” he told
me. “Even if they’ve eaten all the grass in front of them, they won’t
turn to look for a fresh patch—they’ll just start eating dirt!”

We laughed, and I couldn’t help but think about how often the Bible
compares humans to sheep. No wonder we need a shepherd! But since
sheep are so dumb, not just any shepherd will do. Sheep need a
shepherd who cares about them. When the prophet Ezekiel wrote to God’s
people in exile, captives in Babylon, he compared them to sheep led by
bad shepherds. Instead of caring for the flock, Israel’s leaders had
exploited them, profiting from them (v. 3) and then leaving them for
the wild animals to devour (v. 5).

But they were not without hope. God, the Good Shepherd, promised to
rescue them from the leaders who exploited them. He promised to bring
them home, put them in lush pastures, and give them rest. He would
heal the injured and go after the lost (vv. 11–16). He would banish
wild animals, so that His flock would be safe (v. 28).

Members of God’s flock are in need of tender care and direction. How
blessed we are to have a Shepherd who is always leading us to green
pastures! (v.14).
