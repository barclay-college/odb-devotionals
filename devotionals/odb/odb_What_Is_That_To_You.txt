What Is That To You?

What is that to you? You follow Me. —
John 21:22

Today's Scripture: John 21:15-22

When you attend a children’s choir concert, you’re not surprised when
the children look everywhere but at the director. They wiggle, squirm,
and poke each other. They stand on tiptoes to search for parents in
the audience. They raise their hands to wave when they see them. Oh,
yes, and they occasionally sing. We smile at their antics. The
behavior is cute in children. It’s not so cute when adult choir
members don’t watch the conductor. Good music depends on singers who
pay attention to the director so they can stay together as they sing.

Christians sometimes are like singers in a children’s choir. Instead
of looking at Jesus, the great Conductor of the symphony of life, we
are busy squirming or looking at each other or watching the audience.

Jesus admonished Peter for such behavior. After He told him what would
be required of him, Peter pointed to John and asked, “What about him?”
Jesus answered with a question: “What is that to you? You follow Me”
(John 21:22).

Sometimes we are distracted by what others are doing. We think God’s
plan for their life is better than His plan for ours. But God’s plan
for each of us is the same: Follow Jesus. When we watch Him intently,
we’ll not be distracted by God’s plan for anyone else.

Reflect & Pray

My times are in my Father’s hand; How could I wish or ask for more?
For He who has my pathway planned, Will guide me till my journey’s
o’er. — Fraser

Every child of God has a special place in His plan.
