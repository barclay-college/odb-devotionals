Anticipation

I will come again and receive you to Myself. —
John 14:3

Today's Scripture: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18

At the beginning of March, my friend began a countdown. Marked on the
calendar in her office were the 20 days left until the first day of
spring. One morning when I saw her, she volunteered, “Only 12 more
days!” A few days later, “Only 6!” Her enthusiasm started to rub off
on me, and I began to keep track as well. “Just 2 more days, Jerrie!”
“I know!” she beamed.

As believers, we have something to look forward to that is even more
exciting than the anticipation of budding flowers and lots of sunshine
after a long winter. God has made many promises in His Word, and each
one has been or will be fulfilled. But the certainty that Christ will
return is one of the greatest promises of all. “For the Lord Himself
will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel,
and with the trumpet of God. . . . Then we who are alive and remain
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
in the air,” and we’ll be with Him forever (1 Thess. 4:16-17).

Although no one can know the exact day, we have God’s promise that
Jesus will come back (Acts 1:7-11). As we celebrate the spring and
coming Easter season, let’s encourage each other in anticipation of
that day!

Reflect & Pray

He is coming! Oh, the rapture To behold His lovely face, And to tell
Him how I love Him, Who has saved me by His grace. —Dimmock

Christ is coming—perhaps today!
