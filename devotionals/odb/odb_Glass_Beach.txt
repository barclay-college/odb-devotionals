Glass Beach

“On the day when I act,” says the Lord Almighty, “they will be my
treasured possession.”
Malachi 3:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24

Early 20th-century residents of Fort Bragg, California, disposed of
their trash by throwing it over a cliff and onto a nearby beach. Cans,
bottles, tableware, and household garbage accumulated in huge,
disgusting piles. Even when residents stopped depositing trash on the
beach, it remained an embarrassment—a dump seemingly beyond
reclamation.

Over the years, however, wave action broke up the glass and pottery
and washed the rubbish out to sea. The pounding surf rolled and
tumbled the glass fragments in the sand on the ocean floor, frosting
and smoothing the surface and creating gemlike “sea glass,” which it
then deposited back onto the beach. The surf created a kaleidoscopic
beauty at which visitors to Glass Beach now stare in wonder.

Perhaps you feel as though your life has become a dump—a mess beyond
hope. If so, you need to know that there is someone who loves you and
waits to redeem and reclaim you. Give Jesus your heart and ask Him to
make you pure and clean. He may tumble you a bit, and it may take time
to smooth away the rough edges. But He will never give up on you. He
will make you into one of His jewels!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, when we have nothing left but You, we are right where You want
us. You can use any situation for Your glory and our good. You never
give up on us. Help us to relax in Your love.

God loves us too much to let us remain as we are.
