Perfect Peace

Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you.
John 14:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:25–31

A friend shared with me that for years she searched for peace and
contentment. She and her husband built up a successful business, so
she was able to buy a big house, fancy clothes, and expensive jewelry.
But these possessions didn’t satisfy her inner longings for peace, nor
did her friendships with influential people. Then one day, when she
was feeling low and desperate, a friend told her about the good news
of Jesus. There she found the Prince of Peace, and her understanding
of true peace and contentment was forever changed.

Jesus spoke words of such peace to His friends after their last supper
together (John 14), when He prepared them for the events that would
soon follow: His death, resurrection, and the coming of the Holy
Spirit. Describing a peace—unlike anything the world can give—He
wanted them to learn how to find a sense of well-being even in the
midst of hardship.

Later, when the resurrected Jesus appeared to the frightened disciples
after His death, He greeted them, saying, “Peace be with you!” (John
20:19). Now He could give them, and us, a new understanding of resting
in what He has done for us. As we do, we can find the awareness of a
confidence far deeper than our ever-changing feelings.

Heavenly Father, You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are
fixed on You. Help us to trust in You forever, for You are our Rock

Jesus came to usher peace into our lives and our world.
