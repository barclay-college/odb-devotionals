Longing for God

My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
Psalm 84:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:13–16

One day my daughter was visiting with our one-year-old grandson. I was
getting ready to leave the house on an errand, but as soon as I walked
out of the room my grandson began to cry. It happened twice, and each
time I went back and spent a moment with him. As I headed out the door
the third time, his little lip began to quiver again. At that point my
daughter said, “Dad, why don’t you just take him with you?”

Any grandparent could tell you what happened next. My grandson went
along for the ride, just because I love him.

How good it is to know that the longings of our hearts for God are
also met with love. The Bible assures us that we can “know and rely on
the love God has for us” (1 John 4:16). God doesn’t love us because of
anything we have or haven’t done. His love isn’t based on our
worthiness at all, but on His goodness and faithfulness. When the
world around us is unloving and unkind, we can rely on God’s
unchanging love as our source of hope and peace.

Our heavenly Father’s heart has gone out to us through the gift of His
Son and His Spirit. How comforting is the assurance that God loves us
with love that never ends!
