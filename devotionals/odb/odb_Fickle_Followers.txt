Fickle Followers

Behold, your King is coming, sitting on a donkey’s colt. —
John 12:15

Today's Scripture: John 12:12-19; 19:14-16

How quickly public opinion can change! When Jesus entered Jerusalem
for the Passover feast, He was welcomed by crowds cheering to have Him
made king (John 12:13). But by the end of the week, the crowds were
demanding that He be crucified (19:15).

I recognize myself in those fickle crowds. I love cheering for a team
that’s winning, but my interest wanes when they start losing. I love
being part of a movement that is new and exciting, but when the energy
moves to a new part of town, I’m ready to move on. I love following
Jesus when He is doing the impossible, but I slink away when He
expects me to do something difficult. It’s exciting to follow Jesus
when I can do it as part of the “in” crowd. It’s easy to trust Him
when He outsmarts the smart people and outmaneuvers the people in
power (see Matt. 12:10; 22:15-46). But when He begins to talk about
suffering and sacrifice and death, I hesitate.

I like to think that I would have followed Jesus all the way to the
cross—but I have my doubts. After all, if I don’t speak up for Him in
places where it’s safe, what makes me think I would do so in a crowd
of His opponents?

How thankful I am that Jesus died for fickle followers so that we can
become devoted followers.

Reflect & Pray

For Further Thought Read these Bible verses and ponder Jesus’ love for
you (Rom. 5:8; Rom. 8:37-39; Heb. 13:5-6,8; 1 John 3:1). Allow your
devotion to Him to grow.

Christ deserves full-time followers.
