City Of Refuge

I will sing of Your power; yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the
morning; for You have been my defense and refuge in the day of my
trouble. —
Psalm 59:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 59:10-17

As we entered a town in Australia, we were greeted by a sign that
declared: “We welcome all who are seeking refuge and asylum.” This
kind of welcome seems to resonate with the Old Testament concept of
the cities of refuge. In the Old Testament era, cities of refuge (Num.
35:6) were established to be a safe haven for people who had
accidentally killed someone and were needing protection. God had the
people establish such cities to provide that refuge.

This concept, however, was not intended to be simply a practice for
ancient Israel. More than that, cities of refuge reflected the heart
of God for all people. He Himself longs to be our safe haven and our
city of refuge in the failures, heartaches, and losses of life. We
read in Psalm 59:16-17, “I will sing of Your power; yes, I will sing
aloud of Your mercy in the morning; for You have been my defense and
refuge in the day of my trouble. To You, O my Strength, I will sing
praises; for God is my defense, my God of mercy.”

For the hurting heart of every generation, our “city of refuge” is not
a place. Our city of refuge is a Person—the God who loves us with an
everlasting love. May we find our refuge and rest in Him.

Reflect & Pray

How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe, I have fled to my
Refuge and breathed out my woe; How often, when trials like sea
billows roll, Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul. —Cushing

Refuge can be found in the Rock of Ages.
