Hand Me The Binoculars!

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows His
handiwork. —
Psalm 19:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 19:1-6

When I was in elementary school my friend Kent and I would often spend
time looking at the night sky with a pair of German-made binoculars.
We marveled at the stars in the sky and the mountains on the moon. All
throughout the evening we took turns saying, “Hand me the binocs!”

Centuries earlier a Jewish shepherd boy looked up at the night sky and
also marveled. He did not have a pair of binoculars or a telescope to
aid him. But he had something even more important—a personal
relationship with the living God. I imagine the sheep quietly bleating
in the background as David gazed skyward. Later he would write the
inspired text: “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the
firmament shows His handiwork. Day unto day utters speech, and night
unto night reveals knowledge” (Ps. 19:1-2).

In our busy schedules, we can so easily forget to stand in awe of the
heavenly beauty our Creator has prepared for our enjoyment and His
glory. When we set aside time to look at the night sky and marvel at
what is there, we gain a deeper understanding of God and His eternal
power and glory.
