Asking God

The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer.
Psalm 6:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 6:4–9

When my husband, Dan, was diagnosed with cancer, I couldn’t find the
“right” way to ask God to heal him. In my limited view, other people
in the world had such serious problems—war, famine, poverty, natural
disasters. Then one day, during our morning prayer time, I heard my
husband humbly ask, “Dear Lord, please heal my disease.”

It was such a simple but heartfelt plea that it reminded me to stop
complicating every prayer request, because God perfectly hears our
righteous cries for help. As David simply asked, “Turn, Lord , and
deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love” (Psalm 6:4).

That’s what David declared during a time of spiritual confusion and
despair. His exact situation isn’t explained in this psalm. His honest
pleas, however, show deep desire for godly help and restoration. “I am
worn out from my groaning,” he wrote (v. 6).

Yet, David didn’t let his own limits, including sin, stop him from
going to God with his need. Thus, even before God answered, David was
able to rejoice, “the Lord has heard my weeping. The Lord has heard my
cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer” (vv. 8–9).

Despite our own confusion and uncertainty, God hears and accepts the
honest pleas of His children. He’s ready to hear us, especially when
we need Him most.
