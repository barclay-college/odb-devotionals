No Fine Print

For this commandment which I command you today is not too mysterious
for you, nor is it far off. —
Deuteronomy 30:11

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 30:11-20

Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Missy Sullivan noted that many
user agreements, warranties, and disclaimers that come with products
are nearly unreadable. Intentionally set in very small type, they
actually discourage people from understanding them. Because of this,
many people don’t read all the terms of contracts before signing them.
A university professor of graphic communication pointed to a 32-page
user agreement that came with his new smartphone, and said of the
company, “They don’t want you to read it.”

In contrast, the Lord is always seeking to communicate with His people
in clear and compelling ways, with no attempt to confuse or deceive.
When Moses spoke to the Israelites just before they entered the
Promised Land, he said, “For this commandment which I command you
today is not too mysterious for you, nor is it far off. . . . I have
set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose
life, that both you and your descendants may live” (Deut. 30:11,19).

The Lord wants us to understand His plan and purpose clearly, so that
we may love, obey, and cling to Him—for He is our “life and the length
of [our] days” (v.20). That’s plain to see.

Reflect & Pray

Father, we want to learn and experience more of who You are in our
relationship with You. Teach us so that we will grow in our
understanding of You and Your plan for our lives.

There is no fine print in God’s communication with us.
