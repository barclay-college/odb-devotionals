Toxic Look-Alikes

Your heart is not right in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this
your wickedness. —
Acts 8:21-22

Today's Scripture: Acts 8:9-23

Our yard makes poison ivy happy. I learned this the hard way. Even
though I was being careful, I came in contact with the plant and ended
up with a nasty, itchy rash.

Poison ivy looks like many harmless plants, and it keeps company with
some beautiful ones. One gardener couldn’t figure out why she got
poison ivy whenever she pruned her roses. She later discovered that a
poison ivy vine was taking advantage of the tender loving care she
gave to her rosebush.

Some people are like toxic plants. They look harmless, and they blend
in with people who, like roses, are fragrant and beautiful.

Simon the sorcerer fit this description. He followed Philip and was
baptized, but then he asked to buy the ability to lay hands on people
so they could receive the Holy Spirit. Peter was appalled at his
request and urged him to repent (Acts 8:22).

Sometimes people use the favorable environment of a healthy church as
a network for selfish purposes. Like poison ivy among roses, they
cause much misery. Like Simon, anyone who does this needs to repent,
and everyone else needs to avoid contact with such a person. Spiritual
look-alikes appear good but their “fruit” is toxic.

Reflect & Pray

A Prayer: Help me, Lord, to be discerning and not let others lead me
astray with their falsehood. May the fruit of my life be an example of
a follower of Christ. Amen.

A false life belies a true faith.
