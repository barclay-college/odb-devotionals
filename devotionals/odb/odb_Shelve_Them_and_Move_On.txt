Shelve Them and Move On

Whoever heeds life-giving correction will be at home among the wise.
Proverbs 15:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 15:30–33

I’m reminded of some wise advice a radio broadcaster friend once gave
me. Early on in his career, as my friend struggled to know how to deal
with both criticism and praise, he felt that God was encouraging him
to shelve both. What’s the essence of what he took to heart? Learn
what you can from criticism and accept praise. Then shelve both and
humbly move on in God’s grace and power.

Criticism and praise stir in us powerful emotions that, if left
unchecked, can lead to either self-loathing or an overinflated ego. In
Proverbs we read of the benefits of encouragement and wise counsel:
“Good news gives health to the bones. . . .Those who disregard
discipline despise themselves, but the one who heeds correction gains
understanding” (15:30, 32).

If we’re on the receiving end of a rebuke, may we choose to be
sharpened by it. Proverbs states, “Whoever heeds life-giving
correction will be at home among the wise” (v. 31). And if we’re
blessed with words of praise, may we be refreshed and filled with
gratitude. As we walk humbly with God, He can help us learn from both
criticism and praise, shelve them, and then move on in Him (v. 33).

Reflect & Pray

Father God, thank You for the gift of praise and criticism. As I
humbly surrender to You, may I grow and be sharpened by both.

Learn from praise and criticism, then shelve them and move on.
