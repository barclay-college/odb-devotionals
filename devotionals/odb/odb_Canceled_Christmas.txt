Canceled Christmas

Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of
[Jesus]. —
Luke 2:33

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:36-38

We felt as if our Christmas was being canceled last year. Actually,
our flight to see family in Missouri was canceled due to snow. It’s
been our tradition for quite a few years to celebrate Christmas with
them, so we were greatly disappointed when we only got as far as
Minnesota and had to return home to Michigan.

On Sunday, in a message we would have missed, our pastor spoke about
expectations for Christmas. He caught my attention when he said, “If
our expectations for Christmas are gifts and time with family, we have
set our expectations too low. Those are enjoyable and things we’re
thankful for, but Christmas is the celebration of the coming of Christ
and His redemption.”

Simeon and Anna celebrated the coming of Jesus and His salvation when
Joseph and Mary brought Him to the temple as a baby (Luke 2:25-38).
Simeon, a man who was told by the Spirit that he would not die before
he saw the Messiah, declared: “My eyes have seen Your salvation”
(v.30). When Anna, a widow who served God, saw Jesus, she “spoke of
Him to all those who looked for redemption in Jerusalem” (v.38).

We may experience disappointments or heartache during the Christmas
season, but Jesus and His salvation always give us reason to
celebrate.

Reflect & Pray

How wonderful that we on Christmas morn Though centuries have passed
since Christ was born, May worship still the Living Lord of men, Our
Savior, Jesus, Babe of Bethlehem. —Hutchings

Jesus is always the reason to celebrate.
