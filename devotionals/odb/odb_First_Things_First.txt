First Things First

Know the God of your father, and serve Him with a loyal heart and with
a willing mind. —
1 Chronicles 28:9

Today's Scripture: 1 Chronicles 28:5-10

When our granddaughter Sarah was very young, she told us she wanted to
be a basketball coach like her daddy when she grew up. But she
couldn’t be one yet, she said, because first she had to be a player;
and a player has to be able to tie her shoelaces, and she couldn’t tie
hers yet!

First things first, we say. And the first thing in all of life is to
know God and enjoy Him.

Acknowledging and knowing God helps us to become what we were meant to
be. Here is King David’s counsel to his son Solomon: “Know the God of
your father, and serve Him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind”
(1 Chron. 28:9).

Remember, God can be known. He is a Person, not a logical or
theological concept. He thinks, wills, enjoys, feels, loves, and
desires as any person does. A. W. Tozer writes, “He is a person and
can be known in increasing degrees of intimacy as we prepare our
hearts for the wonder of it.” Ah, there’s the rub: We must “prepare
our hearts.”

The Lord is not playing hard to know; those who want to know Him can.
He will not foist His love on us, but He does wait patiently, for He
wants to be known by you. Knowing Him is the first thing in life.
