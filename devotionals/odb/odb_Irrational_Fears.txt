Irrational Fears

I will not forget you!
Isaiah 49:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 49:14–19

It makes no logical sense, but when my parents died within a three-
month period, I feared they would forget me. Of course they were no
longer on earth, but that left me with a large uncertainty. I was a
young, unmarried adult and wondered how to navigate life without them.
Feeling really single and alone, I sought God.

One morning I told Him about my irrational fear and the sadness it
brought (even though He knew it already). The Scripture passage that
came from the devotional I read that day was Isaiah 49: “Can a mother
forget the baby at her breast . . . ? Though she may forget, I will
not forget you!” (v. 15). God reassured His people through Isaiah that
He had not forgotten them and later promised to restore them to
Himself through sending His Son Jesus. But the words ministered to my
heart too. It’s rare for a mother or a father to forget their child,
yet it’s possible. But God? No way. “I have engraved you on the palms
of my hands,” He said.

God’s answer to me could have brought more fear. But the peace He gave
because of His own remembrance of me was exactly what I needed. It was
the start of discovering that God is even closer than a parent or
anyone else, and He knows the way to help us with everything—even our
irrational fears.
