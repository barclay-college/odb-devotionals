Taking Notice

“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?”
Job 38:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 40:1-14

When I clean my house for a special event, I become discouraged
because I think that guests won’t notice what I clean, only what I
don’t clean. This brings to mind a larger philosophical and spiritual
question: Why do humans more quickly see what’s wrong than what’s
right? We are more likely to remember rudeness than kindness. Crimes
seem to receive more attention than acts of generosity. And disasters
grab our attention more quickly than the profound beauty all around
us.

But then I realize I am the same way with God. I tend to focus on what
He hasn’t done rather than on what He has, on what I don’t have rather
than on what I have, on the situations that He has not yet resolved
rather than on the many He has.

When I read the book of Job, I am reminded that the Lord doesn’t like
this any more than I do. After years of experiencing prosperity, Job
suffered a series of disasters. Suddenly those became the focus of his
life and conversations. Finally, God intervened and asked Job some
hard questions, reminding him of His sovereignty and of everything Job
didn’t know and hadn’t seen (Job 38–40).

Whenever I start focusing on the negative, I hope I remember to stop,
consider the life of Job, and take notice of all the wonders God has
done and continues to do.
