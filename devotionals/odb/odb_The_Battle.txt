The Battle

But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.
Psalm 39:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 39:1–7

As artillery rounds fell around him with an earth-shaking whoomp, the
young soldier prayed fervently, “Lord, if you get me through this,
I’ll go to that Bible school Mom wanted me to attend.” God honored his
focused prayer. My dad survived World War II, went to Moody Bible
Institute, and invested his life in ministry.

Another warrior endured a different kind of crisis that drove him to
God, but his problems arose when he avoided combat. As King David’s
troops fought the Ammonites, David was back at his palace casting more
than just a glance at another man’s wife (see 2 Samuel 11). In Psalm
39, David chronicles the painful process of restoration from the
terrible sin that resulted. “The turmoil within me grew worse,” he
wrote. “The more I thought about it, the hotter I got” (vv. 2–3 nlt ).

David’s broken spirit caused him to reflect: “Show me, Lord , my
life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life
is” (v. 4). Amid his renewed focus, David didn’t despair. He had
nowhere else to turn. “But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is
in you” (v. 7). David would survive this personal battle and go on to
serve God.

What motivates our prayer life doesn’t matter as much as the focus of
our prayer. God is our source of hope. He wants us to share our heart
with Him.
