A Father Who Runs

The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost. —
Luke 19:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 15:11-24

Every day a father craned his neck to look toward the distant road,
waiting for his son’s return. And every night he went to bed
disappointed. But one day, a speck appeared. A lonesome silhouette
stood against the crimson sky. Could that be my son? the father
wondered. Then he caught sight of the familiar saunter. Yes, that has
to be my son!

And so while the son was “still a great way off, his father saw him
and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him” (Luke
15:20). It is remarkable that the family patriarch did something that
was considered undignified in Middle Eastern culture—he ran to meet
his son. The father was full of unbridled joy at his son’s return.

The son didn’t deserve such a reception. When he had asked his father
for his share of the inheritance and left home, it was as if he had
wished his father dead. But despite all that the son had done to his
father, he was still his son (v.24).

This parable reminds me that I’m accepted by God because of His grace,
not because of my merits. It assures me that I’ll never sink so deep
that God’s grace can’t reach me. Our heavenly Father is waiting to run
to us with open arms.

Reflect & Pray

Father, I’m so grateful for all Your Son did for me at the cross. I’m
thankful for grace. I offer You a heart that desires to be like
Jesus—merciful and gracious.

We deserve punishment and get forgiveness; we deserve God’s wrath and
get God’s love. —Philip Yancey
