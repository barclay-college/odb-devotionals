I Am With You

Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you.
Jeremiah 1:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 1:1–10

When I served as an intern for a Christian magazine, I wrote a story
about a person who had become a Christian. In a dramatic change, he
said goodbye to his former life and embraced his new Master: Jesus. A
few days after the magazine hit the street, an anonymous caller
threatened, “Be careful, Darmani. We are watching you! Your life is in
danger in this country if you write such stories.”

That was not the only time I have been threatened for pointing people
to Christ. On one occasion a man told me to vanish with the tract I
was giving him or else! In both cases, I cowered. But these were only
verbal threats. Many Christians have had threats carried out against
them. In some cases simply living a godly lifestyle attracts
mistreatment from people.

The Lord told Jeremiah, “You must go to everyone I send you to and say
whatever I command you” (Jer. 1:7), and Jesus told His disciples, “I
am sending you out like sheep among wolves” (Matt. 10:16). Yes, we may
encounter threats, hardships, and even pain. But God assures us of His
presence. “I am with you,” He told Jeremiah (Jer. 1:8), and Jesus
assured His followers, “I am with you always” (Matt. 28:20).

Whatever struggles we face in our attempt to live for the Lord, we can
trust in the Lord’s presence.
