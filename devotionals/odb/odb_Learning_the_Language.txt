Learning the Language

As I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I
even found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god.
Acts 17:23

Today's Scripture: Acts 17:22–32

I stood before the gathering at a small Jamaican church and said in my
best local dialect, “Wah Gwan, Jamaica?” The reaction was better than
I expected, as smiles and applause greeted me.

In reality, all I had said was the standard greeting, “What’s going
on?” in Patois [pa-twa], but to their ears I was saying, “I care
enough to speak your language.” Of course I did not yet know enough
Patois to continue, but a door had been opened.

When the apostle Paul stood before the people of Athens, he let them
know that he knew their culture. He told them that he had noticed
their altar to “an unknown god,” and he quoted one of their poets. Of
course, not everyone believed Paul’s message about Jesus’s
resurrection, but some said, “We want to hear you again on this
subject” (Acts 17:32).

As we interact with others about Jesus and the salvation He offers,
the lessons of Scripture show us to invest ourselves in others—to
learn their language, as it were—as a way to open the door to telling
them the good news (see also 1 Cor. 9:20–23).

As we find out “Wah Gwan?” in others’ lives, it will be easier to
share what God has done in ours.

Reflect & Pray

Show us, Lord, what is important to others. Help us to think of their
interests first, and allow opportunities to speak about the love of
Jesus.

Before you tell others about Christ, let them see how much you care.
