Wonders Of The Heart

By You I have been upheld from birth. —
Psalm 71:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 38:1-11

Our heart beats about 100,000 times every day, pumping blood to every
cell in our bodies. This adds up to about 35 million beats a year and
2.5 billion beats in an average lifetime. Medical science tells us
that every contraction is similar to the effort it would take for us
to hold a tennis ball in our palm and give it a good hard squeeze.

Yet as amazing as our heart is, it is only one example of a natural
world that is designed to tell us something about our Creator. This is
the idea behind the story of a man named Job.

Broken by a series of mounting troubles, Job felt abandoned. When God
finally spoke, He didn’t tell Job why he was suffering. Nor did the
Creator tell him that someday He would suffer for Job. Instead, He
drew Job’s attention to a series of natural wonders that are always
whispering to us—and sometimes shouting—about a wisdom and power far
greater than our own (Job 38:1-11).

So what can we learn from the complexity of this hardworking muscle,
the heart? The message may be similar to the sound of waves coming to
shore and stars quietly shining in the night sky. The power and wisdom
of our Creator give us reason to trust Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we are Yours, You are our God; We have been made so wondrously;
This human frame in every part Your wisdom, power, and love we see.

When we reflect on the power of God’s creation, we see the power of
His care for us.
