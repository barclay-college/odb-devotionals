Being Human Beings

All of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be
compassionate and humble.
1 Peter 3:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 2:11–17; 3:8–9

When asked to define his role in a community that was sometimes
uncooperative with law enforcement, a sheriff didn’t flash his badge
or respond with the rank of his office. Rather he offered, “We are
human beings who work with human beings in crisis.”

His humility—his stated equality with his fellow human beings—reminds
me of Peter’s words when writing to first-century Christians suffering
under Roman persecution. Peter directs: “All of you, be like-minded,
be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble” (1
Peter 3:8). Perhaps Peter was saying that the best response to humans
in crisis is to be human, to be aware that we are all the same. After
all, isn’t that what God Himself did when He sent His Son—became human
in order to help us? (Phil. 2:7).

Gazing only at the core of our fallen hearts, it’s tempting to disdain
our human status. But what if we consider our humanness to be part of
our offering in our world? Jesus teaches us how to live fully human,
as servants recognizing we are all the same. “Human” is how God made
us, created in His image and redeemed by His unconditional love.

Today we’re sure to encounter folks in various struggles. Imagine the
difference we might make when we respond humbly—as fellow humans who
work together with other humans in crisis.
