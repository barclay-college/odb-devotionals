With Us and in Us

I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help
you and be with you forever.
John 14:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:15-21

My son had just started nursery school. The first day he cried and
declared, “I don’t like school.” My husband and I talked to him about
it. “We may not be physically there, but we are praying for you.
Besides, Jesus is with you always.”

“But I can’t see Him!” he reasoned. My husband hugged him and said,
“He lives in you. And He won’t leave you alone.” My son touched his
heart and said, “Yes, Jesus lives in me.”

Kids are not the only ones who suffer from separation anxiety. In
every stage of life we face times of separation from those we love,
sometimes because of geographical distance and sometimes because of
death. However, we need to remember that even if we feel forsaken by
others, God hasn’t forsaken us. He has promised to be with us always.
God sent the Spirit of truth—our Advocate and Helper—to dwell with us
and in us forever (John 14:15-18). We are His beloved children.

My son is learning to trust, but so am I. Like my son, I can’t see the
Spirit, but I feel His power as each day He encourages me and guides
me as I read God’s Word. Let us thank God for His wonderful provision,
the Spirit of Christ who is with us and in us. We are certainly not
alone!
