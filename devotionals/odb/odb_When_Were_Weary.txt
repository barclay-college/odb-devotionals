When We’re Weary

Let us not become weary in doing good.
Galatians 6:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 6:1–10

Sometimes trying to do the right thing can be exhausting. We may
wonder, Do my well-intentioned words and actions make any difference
at all? I wondered this recently when I sent a prayerfully thought-out
email meant to encourage a friend, only to have it met with an angry
response. My immediate reaction was a mixture of hurt and anger. How
could I be so misunderstood?

Before I responded out of anger, I remembered that we won’t always see
the results (or the results we desire) when we tell someone about how
Jesus loves them. When we do good things for others hoping to draw
them to Him, they may spurn us. Our gentle efforts to prompt someone
to right action may be ignored.

Galatians 6 is a good place to turn when we’re discouraged by
someone’s response to our sincere efforts. Here the apostle Paul
encourages us to consider our motives—to “test our actions”—for what
we say and do (vv. 1–4). When we have done so, he encourages us to
persevere: “Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper
time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we
have opportunity, let us do good to all people” (vv. 9–10).

God wants us to continue living for Him, which includes praying for
and telling others about Him—“doing good.” He will see to the results.
