A Joyful Celebration

The wedding of the Lamb has come.
Revelation 19:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 19:1–9

My friend Sharon passed away one year prior to the death of my friend
Dave’s teenage daughter Melissa. They both had been tragically killed
in car accidents. One night both Sharon and Melissa were in my dream.
They giggled and talked as they hung streamers in a large banquet hall
and ignored me when I stepped into the room. A long table with white
tablecloths had been set with golden plates and goblets. I asked if I
could help decorate, but they didn’t seem to hear me and kept working.

But then Sharon said, “This party is Melissa’s wedding reception.”

“Who’s the groom?” I asked.

Neither responded but smiled and looked at each other knowingly.
Finally, it dawned on me—it’s Jesus!

“Jesus is the groom,” I whispered as I woke up.

My dream brings to mind the joyful celebration believers in Jesus will
share together when He returns. It’s portrayed in Revelation as a
lavish feast called “the wedding supper of the Lamb” (19:9). John the
Baptist, who prepared people for the first coming of Christ, had
called Him “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world”
(John 1:29). He also referred to Jesus as “the bridegroom” and to
himself as the “friend” (like the best man) who waited for Him (3:29).

On that banquet day and for all eternity we will enjoy unbroken
fellowship with Jesus, our groom, and with Sharon and Melissa and all
of God’s people.

Reflect & Pray

What does Jesus’ invitation to come to Him for forgiveness and eternal
life mean to you? Who could you tell your story to?

I look forward to that day of celebration and seeing You, Jesus. Come
quickly. Read more about Christ’s ultimate triumph in this study of
