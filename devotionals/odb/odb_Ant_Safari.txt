Ant Safari

Go to the ant . . . . Consider her ways and be wise. —
Proverbs 6:6

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 6:6-11

In his book Adventures Among Ants: A Global Safari with a Cast of
Trillions, Mark Moffett reflects on his early childhood fascination
with ants—an interest that didn’t die as he grew older. Moffett’s
preoccupation led to his earning a doctorate at Harvard and then
embarking on worldwide travel as an expert on the subject. His study
has given him marvelous insights about these industrious creatures.

Long before Moffett discovered some of the wonders of the ant world,
the Scriptures remarked on the ingenuity and work ethic of these tiny
insects. Ants are held up by wise King Solomon as an example of
industry for those who tend to be lazy: “Go to the ant, you sluggard!
Consider her ways and be wise, which, having no captain . . . provides
her supplies in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest”
(Prov. 6:6-8).

The marvels of God’s creation are beautifully illustrated as God uses
His creatures to instruct us. For instance, from the ant we can see
the importance of planning ahead and laying away provisions for the
future (30:25). God built spiritual lessons into nature itself, and we
can learn from creatures even as tiny as an ant.
