Fear Not

Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you
are Mine. —
Isaiah 43:1

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 43:1-4

My wife became seriously ill during her pregnancy with our second
child. As the doctors struggled to find the problem, she continued to
grow weaker—dangerously so.

Watching her suffer was a helpless and horrible feeling for me, and
there were days when it felt as if God were not hearing our prayers.
One Sunday, while I was looking for comfort from Scripture, my eyes
landed on the first verse in Isaiah 43.

“Fear not,” it begins, and ends with “you are Mine.” Instantly, the
Holy Spirit made the words personal. The intimate way God addresses
Israel reminded me of His always-present attention to us too: “When
you pass through the waters . . . through the rivers . . . through the
fire” (v.2). Each phrase rose up in crescendo, from the pages to my
heart.

Our comfort in that hour came not from promises of healing or
miracles, but from knowing we were never alone. We had many other
frightening times, including just after Ethan’s birth, when it looked
as if both he and Cheryl would be lost. But God had used His words to
comfort us and prepare us for those harder moments!

Let these words be a reminder to you that you are never alone.

Reflect & Pray

At times our fears may loom so large, We long for proof that God is
near; It’s then our Father says to us, “Have faith, My child, and do
not fear.” —D. De Haan

Never forget in the darkness, what you know to be true in the light.
