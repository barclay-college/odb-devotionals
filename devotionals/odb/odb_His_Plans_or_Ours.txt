His Plans or Ours?

“Who am I, Lord God . . . that you have brought me this far?”
1 Chronicles 17:16

Today's Scripture: 1 Chronicles 17:1-20

When my husband was 18 years old, he started a car-cleaning business.
He rented a garage, hired helpers, and created advertising brochures.
The business prospered. His intention was to sell it and use the
proceeds to pay for college, so he was thrilled when a buyer expressed
interest. After some negotiations, it seemed that the transaction
would happen. But at the last minute, the deal collapsed. It wouldn’t
be until several months later that his plan to sell the business would
succeed.

It’s normal to be disappointed when God’s timing and design for our
lives do not match our expectations. When David wanted to build the
Lord’s temple, he had the right motives, the leadership ability, and
the resources. Yet God said he could not undertake the project because
he had killed too many people in battle (1 Chron. 22:8).

David could have shaken his fist at the sky in anger. He could have
pouted or plowed ahead with his own plans. But he humbly said, “Who am
I, Lord God . . . that you have brought me this far?” (17:16). David
went on to praise God and affirm his devotion to Him. He valued his
relationship with God more than his ambition.

What is more important—achieving our hopes and dreams, or our love for
God?

Reflect & Pray

Dear heavenly Father, I commit all of my plans to You. Thank You for
bringing me this far. You mean more to me than anything in the world.

True satisfaction is found in yielding ourselves to the will of God.
