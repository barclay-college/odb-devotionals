Greater than the Mess

You, Lord, are my lamp; the Lord turns my darkness into light.
2 Samuel 22:29

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Samuel 22:26-37

A major theme of the Old Testament book of 2 Samuel could easily be
“Life is a mess!” It has all the elements of a blockbuster TV
miniseries. As David sought to establish his rule as king of Israel,
he faced military challenges, political intrigue, and betrayal by
friends and family members. And David himself was certainly not
without guilt as his relationship with Bathsheba clearly showed (chs.
11–12).

Yet near the end of 2 Samuel we find David’s song of praise to God for
His mercy, love, and deliverance. “You, Lord, are my lamp; the Lord
turns my darkness into light” (22:29).

In many of his difficulties, David turned to the Lord. “With your help
I can advance against a troop [run through a barricade]; with my God I
can scale a wall” (v. 30).

Perhaps we identify with David’s struggles because he, like us, was
far from perfect. Yet he knew that God was greater than the most
chaotic parts of his life.

With David we can say, “As for God, his way is perfect: the Lord’s
word is flawless; he shields all who take refuge in him” (v. 31). And
that includes us!

Life is messy, but God is greater than the mess.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we cannot read about the failures and difficulties of others
without being reminded of our own. We bring them all to You, seeking
forgiveness and Your power for a fresh start.

It’s not too late to make a fresh start with God.
