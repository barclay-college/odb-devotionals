Cape Tribulation

My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. —
James 1:2-3

Today's Scripture: James 1:1-8

On June 10, 1770, British navigator James Cook’s ship hit a reef off
the northeast coast of Australia. He sailed the ship out into deeper
water only to hit the reef again, and this time the collision almost
sank the ship. This experience moved Cook to write in the ship’s log:
“The north point [was named] Cape Tribulation because here began all
our troubles.”

Many of us have experienced a trial that has seemed to trigger a
string of other trials. The loss of a job, the death of a loved one,
an unwanted divorce, or a decline in health could all be part of the
list.

Even though a crisis may seem to be our “Cape Tribulation,” God is
still sovereign and He most certainly is in control. It is His purpose
to use tribulation to build resilience into us. James writes: “My
brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing
that the testing of your faith produces patience” (James 1:2-3). The
word translated “patience” means to have staying power or the ability
to endure.

In the midst of your life-changing trial, remember that God is still
at work. He wants to use your “Cape Tribulation” experience to build
your character. He has promised His grace to see you through (2 Cor.
12:9).
