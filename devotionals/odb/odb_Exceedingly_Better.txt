Exceedingly Better

He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his
throne forever.
1 Chronicles 17:12

Today's Scripture: 1 Chronicles 17:1–15

My birthday is the day after my mother’s. As an adolescent, I would
scramble to think of a gift that delighted my mom yet fit in my
budget. She always received my purchases with appreciation, and on the
following day, my birthday, she would present her gift to me. Without
fail, her gift vastly outshone mine. Her intention wasn’t to diminish
what I’d given her; she simply gave generously from her resources,
which far exceeded my own.

My desire to give to my mother reminds me of David’s wish to build a
home for God. Struck by the contrast between his palace and the tent
where God revealed Himself, David longed to build God a temple.
Instead of granting David’s wish to give, God responded by giving
David an exceedingly better gift. God promised that not only would one
of David’s children (Solomon) build the temple (1 Chron. 17:11), but
that He would build David a house, a dynasty. That promise began with
Solomon but found its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus, whose throne was
indeed “established forever” (v. 12). David wanted to give from his
finite resources, but God promised something infinite.

Like David, may we always be moved to give to God out of gratitude and
love. And may we always see how much more abundantly He has given to
us in Jesus.
