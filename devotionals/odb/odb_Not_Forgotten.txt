Not Forgotten

I will not forget you!
Isaiah 49:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 49:13-21

At her mother’s 50th birthday celebration with hundreds of people
present, firstborn daughter Kukua recounted what her mother had done
for her. The times were hard, Kukua remembered, and funds were scarce
in the home. But her single mother deprived herself of personal
comfort, selling her precious jewelry and other possessions in order
to put Kukua through high school. With tears in her eyes, Kukua said
that no matter how difficult things were, her mother never abandoned
her or her siblings.

God compared His love for His people with a mother’s love for her
child. When the people of Israel felt abandoned by God during their
exile, they complained: “The Lord has forsaken me, the Lord has
forgotten me” (Isa. 49:14). But God said, “Can a mother forget the
baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne?
Though she may forget, I will not forget you!” (v. 15).

When we are distressed or disillusioned, we may feel abandoned by
society, family, and friends, but God does not abandon us. It is a
great encouragement that the Lord says, “I have engraved you on the
palms of my hands” (v. 16) to indicate how much He knows and protects
us. Even if people forsake us, God will never forsake His own.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, that I am Yours forever. I’m thankful that I won’t
have to walk through any experience alone.

God never forgets us.
