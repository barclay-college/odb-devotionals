Able and Available

God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.
Psalm 46:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 46

My husband was at work when I received news about my mom’s cancer
diagnosis. I left him a message and reached out to friends and family.
None were available. Covering my face with trembling hands, I sobbed.
“Help me, Lord.” A resulting assurance that God was with me comforted
me through those moments when I felt utterly alone.

I thanked the Lord when my husband came home and support from friends
and family trickled in. Still, the calming awareness of God’s presence
I sensed in those first few hours of lonely grieving affirmed that God
is readily and faithfully available wherever and whenever I need help.

In Psalm 46, the psalmist proclaims God is our sanctuary, strength,
and steadfast supporter (v. 1). When it feels as if we’re surrounded
by chaos or everything we thought was stable crashes down around us,
we don’t have to fear (vv. 2–3). God doesn’t falter (vv. 4–7). His
power is evident and effective (vv. 8–9). Our eternal Sustainer gives
us confidence in His unchanging character (v. 10). The Lord, our
secure stronghold, remains with us forever (v. 11).

God created His followers to prayerfully support and encourage one
another. But He also affirms He is always able and available. When we
call on God, we can trust Him to keep His promises to provide for us.
He will comfort us through His people as well as through His personal
presence.
