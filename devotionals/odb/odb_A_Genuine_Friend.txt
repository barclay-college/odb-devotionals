A Genuine Friend

Two are better than one. —
Ecclesiastes 4:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Samuel 20:32-42

In the novel Shane, a friendship forms between Joe Starrett, a farmer
on the American frontier, and Shane, a mysterious man who stops to
rest at the Starrett home. The men first bond as they work together to
remove a giant tree stump from Joe’s land. The relationship deepens as
Joe rescues Shane from a fight and Shane helps Joe improve and guard
his farmland. The men share a sense of mutual respect and loyalty that
reflects what Scripture says: “Two are better than one . . . . If they
fall, one will lift up his companion” (Eccl. 4:9-10).

Jonathan and David modeled this principle as well. Circumstances
tested their friendship when David suspected that King Saul wanted him
dead. Jonathan doubted this, but David believed it to be true (1 Sam.
20:2-3). Eventually, they decided David would hide in a field while
Jonathan questioned his father about the matter. When Saul’s deadly
intent became clear, the friends wept together and Jonathan blessed
David as he fled (v.42).

You have a genuine friend in Jesus if you have accepted His offer of
salvation—a friend who is always loyal; one who lifts you when you
stumble. He has shown you the greatest love one friend can have for
another—love that led Him to sacrifice His life for you (John 15:13).
