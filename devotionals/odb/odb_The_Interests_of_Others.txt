The Interests of Others

In humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own
interests.
Philippians 2:3–4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:1–11

My friend Jaime works for a huge international corporation. In his
early days with the company, a man came by his desk, struck up a
conversation, and asked Jaime what he did there. After telling the man
about his work, Jaime asked the man his name. “My name is Rich,” he
replied.

“Nice to meet you,” Jaime answered. “And what do you do around here?”

“Oh, I am the owner.”

Jaime suddenly realized that this casual, humble conversation was his
introduction to one of the richest men in the world.

In this day of self-glorification and the celebration of “me,” this
little story can serve as a reminder of Paul’s important words in the
book of Philippians: “Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain
conceit” (2:3). People who turn their attention to others and not on
themselves have the characteristics Paul mentions.

When we “value others above [ourselves],” we demonstrate Christlike
humility (v. 3). We mirror Jesus, who came not “to be served, but to
serve” (Mark 10:45). When we take “the very nature of a servant”
(Phil. 2:7), we have the mindset of Jesus (v. 5).

As we interact with others today, let’s not look on our own interests
alone but also “to the interests of the others” (v. 4).

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, You gave us the model of humility when You left heaven’s
splendors to become a humble servant on earth. Help us practice
Christlike humility in everything we do.

Serve God by serving others.
