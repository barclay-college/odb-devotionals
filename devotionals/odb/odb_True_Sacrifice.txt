True Sacrifice

Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his
friends. —
John 15:13

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:1-11

Eric was one of the good guys. As a police officer, he saw his work as
service to his community and was fully committed to serving at all
costs. Evidence of this desire was seen on the door of Eric’s locker
at the police station, where he posted John 15:13.

In that verse, our Lord said, “Greater love has no one than this, than
to lay down one’s life for his friends.” Those words, however, were
not merely noble ideals. They expressed Eric’s commitment to his duty
as a police officer—a commitment that demanded the ultimate price when
he was killed in the line of duty. It was a real-life display of the
heart of true sacrifice.

Jesus Christ lived out the powerful words of John 15:13 within hours
of stating them. The upper room event where Jesus spoke of such
sacrifice was followed by communion with the Father at Gethsemane, a
series of illegal trials, and then crucifixion before a mocking crowd.

As the Son of God, Jesus could have avoided the suffering, torture,
and cruelty. He was utterly without sin and did not deserve to die.
But love, the fuel that drives true sacrifice, drove Him to the cross.
As a result, we can be forgiven if we will accept His sacrifice and
resurrection by faith. Have you trusted the One who laid down His life
for you?

Reflect & Pray

’Twas not a martyr’s death He died, The Christ of Calvary; It was a
willing sacrifice He made for you—for me. —Adams

Only Jesus, the perfect sacrifice, can declare guilty people perfect.
