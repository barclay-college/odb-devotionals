Put Down Your Burdens

Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you
rest.
Matthew 11:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 11:25–30

A man driving his pickup truck on a country track saw a woman carrying
a heavy load, so he stopped and offered her a lift. The woman
expressed her gratitude and climbed into the back of the truck.

A moment later, the man noticed a strange thing: the woman was still
holding onto her heavy load despite sitting in the vehicle!
Astonished, he pleaded, “Please, Madam, put down your load and take
your rest. My truck can carry you and your stuff. Just relax.”

What do we do with the load of fear, worry, and anxiety we often carry
as we go through life’s many challenges? Instead of relaxing in the
Lord, I sometimes behave like that woman. Jesus said, “Come to me, all
you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matt.
11:28), yet I’ve caught myself carrying burdens I should offload onto
Jesus.

We put down our burdens when we bring them to the Lord in prayer. The
apostle Peter says, “Cast all your anxiety on [Jesus] because he cares
for you” (1 Peter 5:7). Because He cares for us, we can rest and relax
as we learn to trust Him. Instead of carrying the burdens that weigh
us down and weary us, we can give them to the Lord and let Him carry
them.

Reflect & Pray

I’m tired, Lord. I bring You my burdens today. Please keep them and
carry them for me.

Prayer is the place where burdens change shoulders.
