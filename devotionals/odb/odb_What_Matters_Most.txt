What Matters Most

He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through
him.
1 John 4:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:7–19

As Jesus’s beloved disciple John grew older, his teaching became
increasingly narrowed, focusing entirely on the love of God in his
three letters. In the book Knowing the Truth of God’s Love, Peter
Kreeft cites an old legend which says that one of John’s young
disciples once came to him complaining, “Why don’t you talk about
anything else?” John replied, “Because there isn’t anything else.”

God’s love is certainly at the heart of the mission and message of
Jesus. In his earlier gospel account, John recorded the words, “For
God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).

The apostle Paul tells us that God’s love is at the core of how we
live, and he reminds us that “neither death nor life, neither angels
nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be
able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our
Lord” (Rom. 8:38–39).

God’s love is so strong, available, and stabilizing that we can
confidently step into each day knowing that the good things are gifts
from His hand and the challenges can be faced in His strength. For all
of life, His love is what matters most.
