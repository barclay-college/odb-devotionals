Worshiping with Questions

I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation.
Psalm 13:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 13

It’s not uncommon during a long (or short!) trip for someone in a
group of travelers to ask, “Are we there yet?” or “How much longer?”
Who hasn’t heard these universal queries coming from the lips of
children and adults eager to arrive at their destination? But people
of all ages are also prone to ask similar questions when wearied
because of life challenges that never seem to cease.

Such was the case with David in Psalm 13. Four times in two verses
(vv. 1–2), David—who felt forgotten, forsaken, and defeated—lamented
“How long?” In verse two, he asks, “How long must I wrestle with my
thoughts?” Psalms that include lament, like this one, implicitly give
us permission to worshipfully come to the Lord with questions of our
own. After all, what better person to talk to during prolonged times
of stress and strain than God? We can bring our struggles with
illness, grief, the waywardness of a loved one, and relational
difficulties to Him.

Worship need not stop when we have questions. The sovereign God of
heaven welcomes us to bring our worry-filled questions to Him. And
perhaps, like David, in due time our questions will be transformed
into petitions and expressions of trust and praise to the Lord (vv.
3–6).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You that I don’t have to stop worshiping when I have
questions; I can worship You with my questions.

Bring your questions to God.
