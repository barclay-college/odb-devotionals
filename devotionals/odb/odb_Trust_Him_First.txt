Trust Him First

Praise the Lord; praise God our savior! For each day he carries us in
his arms.
Psalm 68:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 46:3–13

“Don’t let go, Dad!”

“I won’t. I’ve got you. I promise.”

I was a little boy terrified of the water, but my dad wanted me to
learn to swim. He would purposefully take me away from the side of the
pool into a depth that was over my head, where he was my only support.
Then he would teach me to relax and float.

It wasn’t just a swimming lesson; it was a lesson in trust. I knew my
father loved me and would never let me be harmed intentionally, but I
was also afraid. I would cling tightly to his neck until he reassured
me all would be well. Eventually his patience and kindness won out,
and I began to swim. But I had to trust him first.

When I feel “over my head” in a difficulty, I sometimes think back on
those moments. They help me call to mind the Lord’s reassurance to His
people: “Even to your old age . . . I am he who will sustain you. I
have made you and I will carry you” (Isaiah 46:4).

We may not always be able to feel God’s arms beneath us, but the Lord
has promised that He will never leave us (Hebrews 13:5). As we rest in
His care and promises, He helps us learn to trust in His faithfulness.
He lifts us above our worries to discover new peace in Him.
