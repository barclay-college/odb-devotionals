A Place For You

If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you
to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. —
John 14:3

Today's Scripture: John 13:36–14:4

A couple who brought their elderly aunt to live with them were
concerned that she would not feel at home. So they transformed a room
in their house into an exact replica of her bedroom at the home she
left behind. When their aunt arrived, her furniture, wall hangings,
and other favorite things felt like a special “Welcome home!” to her.

In John 13:36–14:4, we read that at the Last Supper Jesus spoke to His
disciples and tried to prepare them for His death. When Simon Peter
asked, “Where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going you
cannot follow Me now, but you shall follow Me afterward” (13:36).
Jesus was still speaking directly to Peter (and also meant it for all
of His followers) when He said, “In My Father’s house are many
mansions [rooms]; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to
prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I
will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you
may be also” (14:2-3).

Heaven is a family gathering of believers from every tribe and nation,
but it is also our Father’s house—and in that house He is preparing a
room just for you.

When you arrive in heaven and Jesus opens the door, you’ll know you’re
home.

I have a home in heaven above From sin and sorrow free— A mansion

For the Christian, heaven is spelled H-O-M-E.
