Longing For Spring

Nothing is better for them than to rejoice, and to do good in their
lives. —
Ecclesiastes 3:12

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 3:1-13

It’s been a long, cold winter, and I am eager for warm weather. I’m
tired of seeing bare trees and lifeless brown leaves covering the
ground. I long to see wildflowers poke through the dead leaves and to
watch the woods turn green once more.

Yet even as I anticipate my favorite season, I hear my mother’s voice
saying, “Don’t wish your life away.”

If you’re like me, you sometimes hear yourself saying, “When such and
such happens, then I will . . . or, If only so and so would do this,
then I would do that . . . or, I would be happy if . . . or, I will be
satisfied when . . .”

In longing for some future good, we forget that every day—regardless
of the weather or our circumstances—is a gift from God to be used for
His glory.

According to author Ron Ash, “We are where we need to be and learning
what we need to learn. Stay the course because the things we
experience today will lead us to where He needs us to be tomorrow.”

In every season, there is a reason to rejoice and an opportunity to do
good (Eccl. 3:12). The challenge for each of us every day is to find
something to rejoice about and some good to do—and then to do both.

Reflect & Pray

Just as the winter turns to spring, Our lives have changing seasons
too; So when a gloomy forecast comes, Remember—God has plans for you.

Every season brings a reason to rejoice.
