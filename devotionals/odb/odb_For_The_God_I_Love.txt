For The God I Love

When you fast, do not be like the hypocrites. —
Matthew 6:16

Today's Scripture: Matthew 6:16-18

A couple of years ago in our church we did a sermon series on the Old
Testament tabernacle. Leading up to the message on the table of
showbread, I did something I had never done before—I fasted from food
for several days. I fasted because I wanted to experience the truth
that “man shall not live by bread alone; but man lives by every word
that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord” (Deut. 8:3). I wanted to
deny myself something I love, food, for the God I love more. As I
fasted, I followed Jesus’ teaching about fasting in Matthew 6:16-18.

Jesus gave a negative command: “When you fast, do not be like the
hypocrites, with a sad countenance” (v.16). Then He gave a positive
command about putting oil on your head and washing your face (v.17).
The two commands taken together meant that they should not draw
attention to themselves. Jesus was teaching that this was a private
act of sacrificial worship that should not provide any room for
religious pride. Finally, He gave a promise: Your Father who sees what
is done in secret will reward you (v.18).

Although fasting isn’t required, in giving up something we love, we
may have a deeper experience of the God we love. He rewards us with
Himself.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we desire to walk closely with You every day. Help us to seek
You diligently that we might know You intimately and follow You
obediently. Amen.

Moving away from the table can bring us closer to the Father.
