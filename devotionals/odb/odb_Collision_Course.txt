Collision Course

Be sure your sin will find you out. —
Numbers 32:23

Today's Scripture: 2 Samuel 12:1-15

My wife and I were driving on an expressway when we saw a driver turn
left into a median turnaround that was intended for emergency vehicles
only. He was planning to make a U-turn and head back the other way.

Looking to his right, the driver waited for an opening in oncoming
traffic, so he failed to notice that a police car was backing up
toward him on his left. Finally seeing an opening in traffic, the
U-turn driver pulled out and rammed into the back of the police car.

It’s not unusual for us to think we can get away with doing something
wrong. After King David committed adultery with Bathsheba, he too was
focused on “getting away with it.” But he was on a collision course
with Nathan. His adultery, deceit, and murder “displeased the Lord” (2
Sam. 11:27), so when Nathan exposed David’s grievous sin, the king was
deeply remorseful. He confessed, repented, and received God’s
forgiveness. But the consequences of his sin never departed from his
household (12:10).

If you’ve been trying to get away with something, remember that “your
sin will find you out” (Num. 32:23). Turn yourself in to God. Don’t
hide. Instead, seek His gracious forgiveness.

God knows all you’ve thought or done— From Him you cannot hide;
Confess to Him and He’ll forgive Through Christ the crucified. —Hess

We have to face our sins before we can put them behind us.
