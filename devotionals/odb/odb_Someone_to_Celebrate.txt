Someone to Celebrate

Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our
Maker.
Psalm 95:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 2:1–12

Many manger scenes depict the wise men, or magi, visiting Jesus in
Bethlehem at the same time as the shepherds. But according to the
gospel of Matthew, the only place in Scripture where their story is
found, the magi showed up later. Jesus was no longer in the manger in
a stable at the inn, but in a house. Matthew 2:11 tells us, “On coming
to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed
down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented
him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.”

Realizing that the magi’s visit happened later than we may think
provides a helpful reminder as we begin a new year. Jesus is always
worthy of worship. When the holidays are past and we head back to
life’s everyday routines, we still have Someone to celebrate.

Jesus Christ is Immanuel, “God with us” (Matt. 1:23), in every season.
He has promised to be with us “always” (28:20). Because He is always
with us, we can worship Him in our hearts every day and trust that He
will show Himself faithful in the years to come. Just as the magi
sought Him, may we seek Him too and worship Him wherever we are.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, just as the magi sought You and bowed before You as the
coming King, help me to yield my will to You and to follow where You
lead.

When we find Christ we offer our worship.
