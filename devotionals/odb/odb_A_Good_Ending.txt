A Good Ending

The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his
servants will serve him. They will see his face.
Revelation 22:3–4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 22:1–5

As the lights dimmed and we prepared to watch Apollo 13, my friend
said under his breath, “Shame they all died.” I watched the movie
about the 1970 spaceflight with apprehension, waiting for tragedy to
strike, and only near the closing credits did I realize I’d been
duped. I hadn’t known or remembered the end of the true story—that
although the astronauts faced many hardships, they made it home alive.

In Christ, we can know the end of the story—that we too will make it
home alive. By that I mean we will live forever with our heavenly
Father, as we see in the book of Revelation. The Lord will create a
“new heaven and a new earth” as He makes all things new (21:1, 5). In
the new city, the Lord God will welcome His people to live with Him,
without fear and without the night. We have hope in knowing the end of
the story.

What difference does this make? It can transform times of extreme
difficulty, such as when people face the loss of a loved one or even
their own death. Though we recoil at the thought of dying, yet we can
embrace the joy of the promise of eternity. We long for the city where
no longer will there be any curse, where we’ll live forever by God’s
light (22:5).

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus Christ, give me unfailing hope, that I might rest in Your
promises and welcome Your life eternal.

God promises His people a good end to the story.
