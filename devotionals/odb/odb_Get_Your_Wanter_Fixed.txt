Get Your “Wanter” Fixed

I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content. —
Philippians 4:11

Today's Scripture: Philippians 4:4-13

When my wife was a young girl in Austin, Texas, Carlyle Marney was her
family’s neighbor, pastor, and friend. One of his off-hand remarks
about being content became one of her family’s enduring expressions:
“Dr. Marney says, ‘We just need to get our wanter fixed.’”

It’s so easy to want more than we need and to become more focused on
getting than on giving. Soon, our desires dictate our choices.

When the apostle Paul wrote to the followers of Jesus in the city of
Philippi, he told them, “I have learned in whatever state I am, to be
content . . . . I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both
to abound and to suffer need” (Phil. 4:11-12). Paul was saying, in
effect, “I’ve had my ‘wanter’ fixed.” It’s important to note that Paul
was not born with contentment. He learned it in the difficult
circumstances of everyday life.

During this season of the year, when shopping and buying often take
center stage in so many countries and cultures, why don’t we decide to
focus on being satisfied in our present circumstances? It may sound
difficult, but Paul, when talking about learning to be content said,
“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (v.13).

Reflect & Pray

Help us, Lord, to learn contentment when life is rough. Protect us
from believing the lie that having more will bring us happiness. May
we be content with what You have given.

Contentment begins with having fewer wants.
