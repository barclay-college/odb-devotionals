The Song of Our Lives

The Lord God is my strength and my song. —nlt
Isaiah 12:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 29:1-6; 30:1-9

Everyone touched by a piece of music hears it differently. The
composer hears it in the chamber of his imagination. The audience
hears it with their senses and emotions. The members of the orchestra
hear most clearly the sound of the instruments closest to them.

In a sense, we are the members of God’s orchestra. Often we hear only
the music closest to us. Because we don’t hear a balanced work, we are
like Job who cried as he suffered: “Now those young men mock me in
song; I have become a byword among them” (Job 30:9).

Job recalled how princes and officials had respected him. His life was
“awash in cream, and the rocks gushed olive oil for me” (29:6 nlt).
But now, he had become the target of mockers. “My harp plays sad
music,” he lamented (30:31 nlt). Yet there was much, much more to the
symphony. Job simply couldn’t hear the whole song.

Maybe today you can hear only the sad notes of your own violin. Don’t
lose heart. Every detail in your life is part of God’s composition. Or
perhaps you are listening to a cheerful flute. Praise God for it and
share your joy with someone else.

God’s masterpiece of redemption is the symphony we are playing, and
ultimately everything will work together for His good purposes. God is
the composer of our lives. His song is perfect, and we can trust Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to trust You, especially when my life seems discordant
and out of tune. I thank You because I’m part of Your symphony and
Your song is perfect.

Faith in God’s goodness puts a song in the heart.
