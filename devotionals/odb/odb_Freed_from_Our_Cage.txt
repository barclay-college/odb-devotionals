Freed from Our Cage

[God] brought me out into a spacious place.
Psalm 18:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 18:3–6, 16–19

While out taking walks, writer Martin Laird would often encounter a
man with four Kerry Blue Terriers. Three of the dogs ran wild through
the open fields, but one stayed near its owner, running in tight
circles. When Laird finally stopped and asked about this odd behavior,
the owner explained that it was a rescue dog that had spent most of
his life locked in a cage. The terrier continued to run in circles as
though contained inside a confined box.

The Scriptures reveal that we’re trapped and hopeless unless God
rescues us. The psalmist spoke of being afflicted by an enemy,
entrapped by “the snares of death” with the “cords of death . . .
coiled around” him (Psalm 18:4–5). Enclosed and shackled, he cried to
God for help (v. 6). And with thundering power, He “reached down . . .
and took hold” of him (v. 16).

God can do the same for us. He can break the chains and release us
from our confining cages. He can set us free and carry us “out into a
spacious place” (v. 19). How sad it is, then, when we keep running in
small circles, as if we’re still confined in our old prisons. In His
strength, may we no longer be bound by fear, shame, or oppression. God
has rescued us from those cages of death. We can run free.

Reflect & Pray

What are the cages that have you confined? How are you living as
though an old cage still traps and holds you?

God, You say You set the captives free. Help me to believe it. Help me
to live it. I want to be free. I want to be in Your spacious place.
