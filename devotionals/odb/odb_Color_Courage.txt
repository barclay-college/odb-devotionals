Color Courage

Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ. —
1 Corinthians 11:1

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 4:10-17

A radio ad for watches suggests that listeners buy a watch with a
bright color band and then wear it with clothes of other colors. When
people notice your watch because of its contrasting color, the ad
says, “They’ll see that you have ‘color courage.’ And they’ll want to
be like you.” Something in us enjoys having others follow our example.

If you do a quick reading of 1 Corinthians 4, you might think the
apostle Paul sounds a bit boastful when he says to follow his example
of self-sacrifice (v.16). But a closer look at Paul’s words shows why
he wrote so confidently. He could ask people to imitate him because he
imitated Christ (11:1), the greatest Servant of all.

The persecution he endured and the position he held in the church
(4:10-17) all happened because Paul followed Jesus. When he mentioned
that even if the Corinthians had 10,000 teachers he would still be
their father in the faith (v.15), he was acknowledging that Jesus is
the only reason people could trust his teaching.

If we want people to imitate us, we must first imitate our Lord. If we
have any reason for people to follow our example—if we have any
courage to point others to the Savior—it is because of Him, not us.

Reflect & Pray

Joyfully following Jesus the Lord And trusting His lead every day
Makes us examples that others can see To follow when trials come their
way. —Sper

Others should imitate us only as far as we imitate Christ.
