Heavenly Exclamation!

The heavens declare the glory of God. —
Psalm 19:1

Today's Scripture: 1 Kings 8:22-30

In August 2011, NASA released a composite image from the Hubble
telescope that left people smiling. The image is of two galaxies
beginning to collide. The collision looks like a heavenly exclamation
point (!). The latest statistic I’ve read says there are about 100
billion observable galaxies in the universe. Each galaxy has hundreds
of billions of stars, and more galaxies are being discovered.

When I saw the exclamation-point image on CNN, I was reminded of our
awesome Creator. The heavens exclaim His glory (Ps. 19:1), but He is
even greater than the heavens He has made. After Solomon built a
temple for the Lord’s presence to dwell in, he prayed: “But will God
indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens
cannot contain You. How much less this temple which I have built!” (1
Kings 8:27). He knew that if the heavens couldn’t contain God’s
presence, the temple he had made surely couldn’t contain Him.

The Lord is so much greater than our finite minds can grasp. Yet He
has made it possible for us to know Him through His Son Jesus whom He
sent to live on this earth, to die for us, and to be raised. When we
believe in Him, our lives join the heavens in proclaiming His glory!

Sing praise to God who reigns above, The God of all creation, The God

In creation we see God’s hand, and in redemption we see His heart.
