Mirror, Mirror

He who . . . is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this
one will be blessed in what he does. —
James 1:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 1:19-27

How often do you see your reflection in a mirror? Some studies say
that the average person looks in a mirror 8 to 10 times a day. Other
surveys say it could be as many as 60 to 70 times a day, if glancing
at our reflection in store windows and smart phone screens is
included.

Why do we look so often? Most experts agree that it’s to check our
appearance, especially before meetings or social gatherings. If
something is amiss, we want to fix it. Why look if we don’t plan to
change what’s wrong?

The apostle James said that reading or hearing God’s Word without
acting on it is like looking in a mirror and forgetting what we’ve
seen (1:22-24). But the better alternative is to look closely and act
on what we see. James said, “He who looks into the perfect law of
liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer
of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does” (v.25).

If we hear God’s Word without taking action, we fool only ourselves
(v.22). But when we examine ourselves in light of God’s Word and obey
His instructions, God liberates us from all that keeps us from looking
more and more like Him each day.
