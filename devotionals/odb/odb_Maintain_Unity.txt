Maintain Unity

Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. —
Ephesians 4:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:1-6

A man stranded by himself on an island was finally discovered. His
rescuers asked him about the three huts they saw there. He pointed and
said, “This one is my home and that one is my church.” He then pointed
to the third hut: “That was my former church.” Though we may laugh at
the silliness of this story, it does highlight a concern about unity
among believers.

The church of Ephesus during the time of the apostle Paul was
comprised of both rich and poor, Jews and Gentiles, men and women,
masters and slaves. And where differences exist, so does friction. One
concern Paul wrote about was the issue of unity. But observe what Paul
said about this issue in Ephesians 4:3. He didn’t tell them to be
“eager to produce or to organize unity.” He told them to endeavor “to
keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” Unity already
exists because believers share one body, one Spirit, one hope, one
Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all (vv.4-6).

How do we “keep the unity”? By expressing our different opinions and
convictions with lowliness, gentleness, and patience (v.2). The Spirit
will give us the power to react in love toward those with whom we
disagree.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, may our walk and our service be a picture of the unity of
Father, Son, and Spirit in heaven above. Fill us with the fruit of the
Spirit that we might love others as You desire.

Unity among believers comes from our union with Christ.
