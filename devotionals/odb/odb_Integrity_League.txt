Integrity League

He who walks with integrity walks securely. —
Proverbs 10:9

Today's Scripture: Psalm 26

We call it the Integrity League, but it’s really just a bunch of guys
who get together at lunchtime to play basketball. We call fouls on
ourselves, attempt to avoid angry outbursts, and simply try to keep
everything fair and enjoyable. We are competitive and we don’t like to
lose—but we all agree that integrity and honesty should control the
atmosphere.

Integrity. Scripture clearly indicates the importance of this trait.
And we honor the God of our lives when we practice it.

Through His Word, God has given us clear reasons to “walk in . . .
integrity” (Ps. 26:11). A person who has integrity has the security of
a quiet life unknown to the one who “perverts his ways” (Prov. 10:9).
The follower of God who lives with integrity is preserved by his
confidence in God, for that person waits for God’s intervention in his
life instead of running ahead of Him (Ps. 25:21). And the one who
practices integrity will be given guidance and clear direction (Prov.
11:3).

Why should we care about life’s “Integrity League”? Because obeying
God this way shows that we trust Him with our lives and that we want
to shine His great love on others.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, help my word be true. Help my actions be honest. Help my
life to reflect Your holiness and shine God’s light for all to see.
Help me to live with integrity.

Integrity is Christlike character in workclothes.
