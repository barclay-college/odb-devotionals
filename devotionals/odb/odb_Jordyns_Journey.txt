Jordyn’s Journey

I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. —
Philippians 4:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:10-13

Jordyn Castor was born blind. But this doesn’t hold her back from
living a full and productive life. The documentary Can You See How I
See? tells her story. She excels at school and with a little help she
enjoys biking and downhill skiing.

Of her sight, Jordyn says: “If I could give my blindness back, I
wouldn’t do it. I think God made all of us the way we are for a reason
. . . and I think my blindness is part of what I am going to do with
my life.” She is now a university student majoring in computer
technology. Her dream is to assist in developing new computer software
that will help the blind.

How can Jordyn maintain such a positive outlook on life? As a Christ-
follower, she understands that God is in control of the circumstances
of life. This gives her confidence to pursue opportunities that others
might not have believed possible. Certainly, Jordyn’s life illustrates
this truth from Philippians: “I can do all things through Christ who
strengthens me” (4:13).

No matter what our strengths or weaknesses might be, God’s
providential hand can give us what we need to make a difference for
Him in our world. Rely on His strength to help you as you take a step
of faith.

Reflect & Pray

“I will strengthen,” so take courage, Child of God, so weak and frail;
God has said so, and it must be, For His promise cannot fail! —Anon.

God’s call to a task includes His strength to complete it.
