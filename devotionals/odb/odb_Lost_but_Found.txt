Lost but Found

Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.
Luke 15:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 15:1–9

When we discovered that my mother-in-law had gone missing while
shopping with a relative, my wife and I were frantic. Mom suffered
from memory loss and confusion, and there was no telling what she
might do. Would she wander the area, or hop onto any bus thinking it
would take her home? Worst-case scenarios spun through our minds as we
began to search for her, crying out to God, “Please find her.”

Hours later, my mother-in-law was spotted stumbling along a road,
miles away. How God blessed us in being able to find her. Several
months later, He blessed her: at eighty years of age, my mother-in-law
turned to Jesus Christ for salvation.

Jesus, comparing humans to lost sheep, gives us this illustration:
“Suppose [a shepherd] has a hundred sheep and loses one of them.
Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the
lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, . . . he calls his
friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have
found my lost sheep” (Luke 15:4–6).

Shepherds counted their sheep to make sure every one was accounted
for. In the same way, Jesus, who likens himself to that shepherd,
values each of us, young and old. When we’re wandering in life,
searching, wondering about our purpose, it’s never too late to turn to
Christ. God wants us to experience His love and blessings.
