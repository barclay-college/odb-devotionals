Connecting the Dots

Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what
was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.
Luke 24:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 24:13–32

In the 1880s French artist Georges Seurat introduced an art form known
as pointillism. As the name suggests, Seurat used small dots of color,
rather than brush strokes of blended pigments, to create an artistic
image. Up close, his work looks like groupings of individual dots. Yet
as the observer steps back, the human eye blends the dots into
brightly colored portraits or landscapes.

The big picture of the Bible is similar. Up close, its complexity can
leave us with the impression of dots on a canvas. As we read it, we
might feel like Cleopas and his friend on the road to Emmaus. They
couldn’t understand the tragic “dotlike” events of the Passover
weekend. They had hoped that Jesus “was the one who was going to
redeem Israel” (Luke 24:21), but they had just witnessed His death.

Suddenly a man they did not recognize was walking alongside them.
After showing an interest in their conversation, He helped them
connect the dots of the suffering and death of their long-awaited
Messiah. Later, while eating a meal with them, Jesus let them
recognize Him—and then He left as mysteriously as He came.

Was it the scarred dots of the nail wounds in His hands that caught
their attention? We don’t know. What we do know is that when we
connect the dots of Scripture and Jesus’s suffering (vv. 27, 44), we
see a God who loves us more than we can imagine.
