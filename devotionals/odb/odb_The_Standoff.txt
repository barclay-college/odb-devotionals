The Standoff

He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. —
1 John 4:4

Today's Scripture: 1 John 4:1-6

When a local bookstore rearranged its shelves, I noticed an increase
in the number of titles relating to sorcery and witchcraft. In fact,
the religion section had become a virtual “standoff” between light and
darkness. Christian titles flanked one side of the aisle, while
roughly the same number of occult books lined the other side.

Sometimes we may think of God and Satan in the same way I thought of
the books in that bookstore. We see them as opposing but equal forces
with the same unlimited power. However, God is God and Satan is not.
God is stronger than any force of darkness. He does what He pleases
(Ps. 135:6), while Satan’s power is limited to what God allows. When
Satan supposed that misfortune would make Job curse God, God told
Satan, “Behold, all that [Job] has is in your power; only do not lay a
hand on his person” (Job 1:12). Satan had to play by God’s rules.

Because God is in charge over everything, as Christ’s followers we
don’t need to be paralyzed by fear of Satan’s power over our lives or
the lives of the believers around us. He tempts us and tries to
influence us, but the Bible assures us, “He who is in [us] is greater
than he who is in the world” (1 John 4:4).

Reflect & Pray

All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ name! Let angels prostrate fall; Bring
forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all! —Perronet

The powers of evil around you are no match for the power of Jesus
within you.
