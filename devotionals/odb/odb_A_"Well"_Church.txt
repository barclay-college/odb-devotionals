A "Well" Church

They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship. —
Acts 2:42

Today's Scripture: Acts 2:41-47

Pastor and author Greg Laurie says that churches are “well” when they
practice these activities:

W-orship E-vangelize L-earn L-ove

Like the early church, we should be active in these ways today.

Worship. We must meet together for fellowship, communion, prayer, and
praise (Acts 2:42,47). God is to be the focus of all we do in His
church.

Evangelize. As we share the Word, the Lord will add new believers to
the church (v.47). We can all take part in spreading God’s Word by
developing a friendship, by giving someone an article about the
gospel, or by sharing some Scripture verses with a stranger.

Learn. We must continue learning sound doctrine taught by qualified
leaders (v.42). The Bible is filled with instruction for living, and
we should take every opportunity to learn from it, apply it to our
lives, and teach others.

Love. We are to share with whoever has need, and enjoy the fellowship
of other believers regularly (vv.45-46).

A church whose members worship, evangelize, learn, and love will be a
“well” church, effective in the community, and appreciated by “all the
people” (v.47).

Reflect & Pray

Churches grow when people pray And pastors preach the Word, When love
for Christ sends out the call To those who have not heard. —D. De Haan

A world in despair needs churches that care.
