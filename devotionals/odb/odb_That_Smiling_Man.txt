That Smiling Man

Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the
Lord, not for human masters.
Colossians 3:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:18–23

Going to the grocery store isn’t something I particularly enjoy. It’s
just a mundane part of life—something that has to be done.

But there is one part of this task I’ve unexpectedly come to look
forward to: checking out in Fred’s lane. Fred, you see, turns checkout
into show time. He’s amazingly fast, always has a big smile, and even
dances (and sometimes sings!) as he acrobatically flips (unbreakable)
purchases into a plastic bag. Fred clearly enjoys a job that could be
seen as one of the most tedious around. And for just a moment, his
cheerful spirit brightens the lives of people in his checkout lane.

The way Fred does his job has won my respect and admiration. His
cheerful attitude, desire to serve, and attention to detail all line
up well with the apostle Paul’s description of how we are to work in
Colossians 3:23: “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as
working for the Lord.”

When we’re in relationship with Jesus, any job we have to do gives us
an opportunity to reflect His presence in our lives. No task is too
small . . . or too big! Tackling our responsibilities—whatever they
may be—with joy, creativity, and excellence gives us an opportunity to
influence those around us, no matter our job.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to tackle everything on my plate today with grace,
enthusiasm, and joy, knowing that my attitude may affect others in
ways I’m not even aware of.

The best way to do satisfying work is to do it for the Lord.
