Grandpa Snucked Out

My heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; my flesh also will rest in
hope. —
Psalm 16:9

Today's Scripture: Psalm 16

My cousin Ken fought a courageous 4-year battle with cancer. In his
final days, his wife, three children, and several grandchildren were
in and out of his room, spending time with him and sharing special
goodbyes. When everyone was out of the room for a moment, he slipped
into eternity. After the family realized that he was gone, one young
granddaughter sweetly remarked, “Grandpa snucked out.” One moment the
Lord was with Ken here on earth; the next moment Ken’s spirit was with
the Lord in heaven.

Psalm 16 was a favorite psalm of Ken’s that he had requested to be
read at his memorial service. He agreed with the psalmist David who
said that there was no treasure more valuable than a personal
relationship with God (vv.2,5). With the Lord as his refuge, David
also knew that the grave does not rob believers of life. He said, “You
will not leave my soul in Sheol [the grave]” (v.10). Neither Ken nor
anyone else who knows Jesus as Savior will be abandoned in death.

Because of Jesus’ own death and resurrection, we too will rise one day
(Acts 2:25-28; 1 Cor. 15:20-22). And we will find that “at [God’s]
right hand are pleasures forevermore” (Ps. 16:11).
