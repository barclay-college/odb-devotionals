The Man Who Couldn’t Talk

Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
Psalm 96:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 96

Sitting in his wheelchair at a senior citizens home in Belize, a man
joyfully listened as a group of American high school teenagers sang
about Jesus. Later, as some of the teens tried to communicate with
him, they discovered he couldn’t talk. A stroke had robbed him of his
ability to speak.

Since they couldn’t carry on a conversation with the man, the teens
decided to sing to him. As they began to sing, something amazing
happened. The man who couldn’t talk began to sing. With enthusiasm, he
belted out “How Great Thou Art” right along with his new friends.

It was a remarkable moment for everyone. This man’s love for God broke
through the barriers and poured out in audible worship—heartfelt,
joyous worship.

We all have worship barriers from time to time. Maybe it’s a
relationship conflict or a money problem. Or it could be a heart
that’s grown a bit cold in its relationship to God.

Our non-talking friend reminds us that the greatness and majesty of
our almighty God can overcome any barrier. “O Lord , my God—when I in
awesome wonder, consider all the worlds Thy hands have made!”

Struggling in your worship? Reflect on how great our God is by reading
a passage such as Psalm 96, and you too may find your obstacles and
objections replaced by praise.
