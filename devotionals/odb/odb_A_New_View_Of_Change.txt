A New View Of Change

I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep. —
John 10:14

Today's Scripture: John 10:7-18

People hate change, or so I hear. But the change we generally resist
is the kind that we think will make our situation worse rather than
better. We eagerly change jobs when it means higher pay and more
influence. We happily move to a bigger house in a better neighborhood.
So it’s not change in general that we hate; it’s change that involves
loss—sometimes physical; other times emotional or psychological.

Change is both inevitable and necessary. If everything stays the same,
no one is growing. But we have a Shepherd who guides us through change
and leads us to a better place. Getting there may be difficult, as it
was for the Israelites in reaching the Promised Land. They grumbled
when their situation got worse rather than better (Ex. 15:24; Num.
14:2). But we have the example of Jesus. In less than a week, He went
from being the leader of many to being abandoned by all. Between Palm
Sunday and Good Friday, the Good Shepherd became the Passover Lamb.
Because Christ willingly went through suffering, God elevated Him to
the highest place (John 10:11; Phil. 2:8-9).

Not all change is pleasant, but when we’re being led to a better place
by Someone who loves us, we don’t need to fear it.

Reflect & Pray

I know not, but God knows; Oh, blessed rest from fear! All my
unfolding days To Him are plain and clear. —Flint

Faith in Christ will keep us steady in the stormy sea of change.
