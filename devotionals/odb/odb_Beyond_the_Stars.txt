Beyond the Stars

You have set your glory in the heavens.
Psalm 8:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 8:1–9

In 2011, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration celebrated
thirty years of space research. In those three decades, shuttles
carried more than 355 people into space and helped construct the
International Space Station. After retiring five shuttles, NASA has
now shifted its focus to deep-space exploration.

The human race has invested massive amounts of time and money, with
some astronauts even sacrificing their lives, to study the immensity
of the universe. Yet the evidence of God’s majesty stretches far
beyond what we can measure.

When we consider the Sculptor and Sustainer of the universe who knows
each star by name (Isaiah 40:26), we can understand why the psalmist
David praises His greatness (Psalm 8:1). The Lord’s fingerprints are
on “the moon and the stars, which [He] set in place” (v. 3). The Maker
of the heavens and the earth reigns above all, yet He remains near all
His beloved children, caring for each intimately and personally (v.
4). In love, God gives us great power, responsibility, and the
privilege to care for and explore the world He’s entrusted to us (vv.
5–8).

As we study our star-spattered night skies, our Creator invites us to
seek Him with passion and persistence. He hears every prayer and song
of praise flowing from our lips.

Loving Creator of the universe, thank You for being mindful of us.

The greatness of God is evident in His awesome vastness and intimate
nearness.
