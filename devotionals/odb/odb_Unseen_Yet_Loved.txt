Unseen, Yet Loved

Though you have not seen him, you love him.
1 Peter 1:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 1:1-9

Like others in the blogging community, I’d never met the man known to
us as BruceC. Yet when his wife posted a note to the group to let us
know that her husband had died, a string of responses from distant
places showed we all knew we had lost a friend.

BruceC had often opened his heart to us. He talked freely about his
concern for others and what was important to him. Many of us felt like
we knew him. We would miss the gentle wisdom that came from his years
in law enforcement and his faith in Christ.

In recalling our online conversations with BruceC, I gained a renewed
appreciation for words written by a first-century witness of Jesus. In
the first New Testament letter the apostle Peter wrote, he addressed
readers scattered throughout the Roman Empire: “Though you have not
seen [Christ], you love him” (1 Peter 1:8).

Peter, as a personal friend of Jesus, was writing to people who had
only heard about the One who had given them reason for so much hope in
the middle of their troubles. Yet, as a part of the larger community
of believers, they loved Him. They knew that at the price of His own
life, He had brought them into the everlasting family of God.
