Beware Of What You Want

You shall not covet. —
Exodus 20:17

Today's Scripture: Exodus 20:1-17

Sometimes I wonder why God didn’t list the Ten Commandments in reverse
order, since the 10th commandment correlates to the first sin—desire.
Eve’s sin wasn’t simply her desire for a piece of fruit; it was the
desire for knowledge that Satan told her would make her like God (Gen.
3:5). Eve’s covetousness caused her to violate both the first and
tenth commands that God later gave to Moses.

When we don’t covet, we pretty much eliminate our reasons to disobey
the other commands. Wanting what isn’t ours causes us to lie, steal,
commit adultery, murder, and refuse to honor our parents. We refuse to
rest because we can’t get what we want in 6 days of work. We misuse
God’s name when we use it to justify something that we want to do. We
make gods out of wealth and relationships because we don’t want to
have to put all our trust in God.

I have a hard time coming up with sins that don’t involve some form of
covetousness. Yet because it’s the last in the list, we tend to think
of it as being the least important. But it’s not. When we stop sin
while it is still in our hearts and heads, we avoid making others the
victim of our sin, and we avoid many of the serious consequences of
sin.

Reflect & Pray

When you covet someone else’s things, Thinking that they’re better
than your own, Just remember that God’s gifts to you Were designed for
you and you alone. —Hess

Contentment is realizing that God has already given me all I need.
