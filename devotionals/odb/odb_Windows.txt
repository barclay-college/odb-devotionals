Windows

You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace.
Isaiah 55:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 55:6–13

Near the foothills of the Himalayas, a visitor noticed a row of houses
without windows. His guide explained that some of the villagers feared
that demons might sneak into their homes while they slept, so they
built impermeable walls. You could tell when a homeowner began to
follow Jesus because he put in windows to let in the light.

A similar dynamic may take place in us, though we might not see it
quite that way. We live in scary, polarizing times. Satan and his
demons instigate angry divisions that split families and friends. I
often feel like hiding behind my walls. But Jesus wants me to cut in a
window.

Israel sought refuge in higher walls, but God said their security lay
with Him. He reigns from heaven, and His word governs all (Isaiah
55:10–11). If Israel would return to Him, God would “have mercy on
them” (v. 7) and restore them as His people to bless the world
(Genesis 12:1–3). He would lift them up, ultimately leading them in a
triumphal parade. Their celebration “will be for the L ord ’s renown,
for an everlasting sign, that will endure forever” (Isaiah 55:13).

Sometimes walls are necessary. Walls with windows are best. They show
the world that we trust God for the future. Our fears are real. Our
God is greater. Windows open us to Jesus—“the light of the world”
(John 8:12)—and to others who need Him.

Reflect & Pray

Would you say your life is more wall or window? Why? Is there a person
or situation you need to be more open to?

Almighty Father, flood my heart with the confidence of Your love.
