Unexpected Kindness

For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works.
Ephesians 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:1–10

My friend was waiting to pay for her groceries when the man in front
of her turned around and handed her a voucher for £10 ($14) off her
bill. Short on sleep, she burst into tears because of his kind act;
then she started laughing at herself for crying. This unexpected
kindness touched her heart and gave her hope during a period of
exhaustion. She gave thanks to the Lord for His goodness extended to
her through another person.

The theme of giving was one the apostle Paul wrote about in his letter
to gentile Christians in Ephesus. He called them to leave their old
lives behind and embrace the new, saying that they were saved by
grace. Out of this saving grace, he explained, flows our desire to “do
good works,” for we have been created in God’s image and are His
“handiwork” (2:10). We, like the man at the supermarket, can spread
God’s love through our everyday actions.

Of course, we don’t have to give material things to share God’s grace;
we can show His love through many other actions. We can take the time
to listen to someone when they speak to us. We can ask someone who is
serving us how they are. We can stop to help someone in need. As we
give to others, we’ll receive joy in return (Acts 20:35).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, You created us in Your image, and we rejoice that we can
share Your love and life. Help us to see the opportunities to give to
others today.

We’ve been created to share God’s love through giving His gifts.
