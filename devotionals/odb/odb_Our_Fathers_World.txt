Our Father’s World

The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness, the world and those who
dwell therein. —
Psalm 24:1

Today's Scripture: Genesis 1:26-28

When Amanda Benavides was a sophomore at Point Loma Nazarene
University in San Diego, California, she began to rethink her views on
Christian stewardship of the earth. Amanda had grown up thinking that
being conscious of the environment had nothing to do with her
relationship with Jesus. All this changed when she was challenged to
consider the Christian’s role in caring for the planet—especially how
that relates to reaching the most needy in the world.

Our stewardship of the beautiful world God gave us, and our care for
the people in it, express our reverence for God and is grounded in two
biblical principles.

First, the earth belongs to God (Ps. 24:1-2). The psalmist praised the
Lord for His creation and His ownership of it. The heavens, the earth,
and all that are in it are His. He created it, He is sovereign over it
(93:1-2), and He cares for it (Matt. 6:26-30). Second, God delegated
the responsibility for the well-being of His earth to us (Gen.
1:26-28). This includes appreciation of and care for both nature (Lev.
25:2-5,11; Prov. 12:10) and people (Rom. 15:2).

This is our Father’s world. Let’s show Him how much we love Him by
respecting it and caring for the people who populate it.

Reflect & Pray

The natural world that God has made Must not be used at whim; We serve
as stewards of His earth, Responsible to Him. —D. DeHaan

To mistreat God’s creation is to offend the Creator.
