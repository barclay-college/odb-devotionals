True Hope

The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s
children.
Romans 8:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:1–11

Not long ago I visited the Empire State Building with a friend. The
line looked short—just down the block and around the corner. Yet as we
entered the building, we discovered the line of people stretching
through the lobby, up the stairs, and into another room. Every new
turn revealed more distance to go.

Attractions and theme parks carefully route their crowds to make the
lines seem shorter. Yet disappointment can lurk “just around the
bend.”

Sometimes life’s disappointments are much more severe. The job we
hoped for doesn’t materialize; friends we counted on let us down; the
romantic relationship we longed for fails to work out. But into these
heartbreaks, God’s Word speaks a refreshing truth about our hope in
Him. The apostle Paul wrote, “Suffering produces perseverance;
perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us
to shame [or disappoint us], because God’s love has been poured out
into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us”
(Romans 5:3–5).

As we place our trust in Him, through His Spirit, God whispers the
truth that we are unconditionally loved and will one day be with
Him—regardless of the obstacles we face. In a world that may often
disappoint us, how good it is to know that God gives genuine hope.
