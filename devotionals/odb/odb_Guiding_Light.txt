Guiding Light

God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
Genesis 1:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 1:1–5

The restaurant was lovely but dark. Only one small candle flickered on
every table. To create light, diners used their smartphones to read
their menus, look to their tablemates, and even to see what they were
eating.

Finally, a patron quietly pushed back his chair, walked over to a
waiter, and asked a simple question. “Could you turn on the lights?”
Before long, a warm ceiling light flashed on and the room erupted with
applause. But also with laughter. And happy chatter. And thank-yous.
My friend’s husband turned off his phone, picked up his utensils, and
spoke for us all. “Let there be light! Now, let’s eat!”

Our gloomy evening turned festive with the flick of a switch. But how
much more important to know the real source of true light. God Himself
spoke those astonishing words, “Let there be light,” on the first day
when He created the universe, “and there was light” (Genesis 1:3).
Then “God saw that the light was good” (v. 4).

Light expresses God’s great love for us. His light points us to Jesus,
“the light of the world” (John 8:12), who guides us from the gloom of
sin. Walking in His light, we find the bright path to a life that
glorifies the Son. He is the world’s brightest gift. As He shines, may
we walk His way.

Reflect & Pray

In what situation do you need Christ’s light to shine? When has His
light guided you?

Loving God, we thank You for Jesus, the Light of the World, and the
guiding light of His great love.
