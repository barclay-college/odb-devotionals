Continuing with Christ

Whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.
Matthew 16:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Kings 19:19-21

As a child, my favorite week of the summer was the one I spent at a
Christian youth camp. At the end of the week, I’d sit elbow-to-elbow
with friends in front of an enormous bonfire. There, we would share
what we had learned about God and the Bible and sing. One song I still
remember focused on deciding to follow Jesus. The chorus contained an
important phrase: “no turning back.”

When Elisha decided to follow the prophet Elijah, Elisha did something
incredible that made it difficult, impossible really, for him to
return to his prior occupation of farming. After going home and having
a farewell banquet, Elisha “took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them”
(1 Kings 19:21). Leaving his way of life, he burned up his plowing
equipment. He roasted the freshly butchered meat over the blaze and
fed everyone present. Then “[Elisha] arose and followed Elijah, and
became his servant” (v. 21).

Giving ourselves to God, who deserves our devotion, often comes with a
price. At times, it means making difficult decisions about
relationships, finances, and living arrangements. However, nothing
compares with what we gain when we continue on with Christ. Jesus
said, “Whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever
loses his life for My sake will find it” (Matt. 16:25).

Reflect & Pray

Father, help me to see if there’s something You want me to leave
behind to follow You completely.

Jesus is looking for fulltime followers.
