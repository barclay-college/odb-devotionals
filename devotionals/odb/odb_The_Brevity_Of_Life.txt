The Brevity Of Life

The days of our lives are seventy years; . . . yet their boast is only
labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. —
Psalm 90:10

Today's Scripture: Psalm 90

On October 19, 2008, I heard the news that Levi Stubbs, lead singer
for Motown’s vocal group The Four Tops, had died at age 72. As a boy,
I enjoyed the Four Tops, especially Stubbs’ emotion-filled, passionate
voice. I had never met him or heard the group in concert, yet his
passing affected me at an unexpected level.

Behind my sadness, I think, was the reminder that I too am getting
older. The death of someone I listened to when I was young reminded me
that time isn’t marching on—it’s running out!

In the only psalm attributed to Moses, he wrote, “The days of our
lives are seventy years; and if by reason of strength they are eighty
years, yet their boast is only labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut
off, and we fly away” (90:10). Those aren’t words we want to hear. We
want to remain forever young, but Scripture reminds us that the years
pass and death will one day arrive.

That leaves us to wrestle with two essential questions: Am I ready to
“fly away” at life’s end, having trusted Christ as my Savior? And am I
using my fleeting days to please the One who loves me eternally?

How are you doing—no matter what your age—with the challenges raised
by the brevity of life?

Reflect & Pray

Our vigor is fleeting, our best years are brief, Our youth passes
quickly—time’s ever a thief; But hope yet becomes us—death’s sting
holds no power; We have a Redeemer—an unfailing Tower. —Gustafson

You can’t control the length of your life, but you can control its
depth.
