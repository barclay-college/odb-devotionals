Do No Harm

Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of
the law. —
Romans 13:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 13:8-10

Many consider the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates as the father of
Western medicine. He understood the importance of following moral
principles in the practice of medicine, and is credited with writing
the Hippocratic Oath, which still serves as an ethical guide for
today’s medical doctors. One key concept of the oath is “to do no
harm.” It implies that a physician will do only what he thinks will
benefit his patients.

The principle of doing no harm extends to our relationships with
others in everyday life. In fact, benevolence is central to New
Testament teaching about loving others. In reflecting on the law of
God, Paul sees that love is the intent behind many biblical commands:
“Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of
the law” (Rom. 13:10).

Each day as we follow Jesus Christ our Savior, we are faced with
choices that will affect the lives of others. When we choose a course
of action, we should ask ourselves, “Does this reflect Christ’s
concern for others, or am I only concerned for myself?” Such a
sensitivity demonstrates the love of Christ that seeks to heal the
broken and help those in need.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I admit that it is easy to be consumed with my own wants and
needs. Thank You that You showed us how to be concerned for others
too. Help me to follow Your example in caring for others.

Caring for the burdens of others helps us to forget about our own.
