Unstoppable

The Lord opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the Lord
standing in the way. —
Numbers 22:31

Today's Scripture: Numbers 22:10-34

Under it. Over it. Around it. Through it. Nothing will stop me from
doing it.” I often hear people express this kind of attitude when they
get an idea or see an opportunity that seems good or profitable. They
devote all of their resources to getting it done.

As evidence that this way of thinking may be flawed, I call as my
witness a donkey—a donkey belonging to a man named Balaam.

Balaam was offered a profitable assignment from a neighboring king,
and he inquired of God for permission to accept it (Num. 22). When God
said no, the king’s representatives made a better offer. Thinking God
might change His mind, Balaam asked again. God granted permission for
Balaam to go with them but with strict conditions. God knew Balaam’s
heart and was not pleased with him, so He placed His Angel in the way.
Balaam couldn’t see the Angel but his donkey could. When the donkey
refused to continue, Balaam became angry with the animal for blocking
his progress.

Balaam’s story teaches us that not every obstacle is meant to be
overcome. Some are placed by God to keep us from doing something
foolish. When our plans are hindered, we shouldn’t assume that it’s
Satan trying to stop us. It might be God trying to protect us.

Reflect & Pray

Let Your wisdom guide me ever, For I dare not trust my own; Lead me,
Lord, in tender mercy, Leave me not to walk alone. —Reed

God is always protecting us— even when we don’t realize we need it.
