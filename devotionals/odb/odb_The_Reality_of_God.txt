The Reality of God

The Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he [saw] chariots of fire all
around Elisha.
2 Kings 6:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 6:8–17

In C. S. Lewis’ The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the
Wardrobe, all of Narnia is thrilled when the mighty lion Aslan
reappears after a long absence. Their joy turns to sorrow, however,
when Aslan concedes to a demand made by the evil White Witch. Faced
with Aslan’s apparent defeat, the Narnians experience his power when
he emits an earsplitting roar that causes the witch to flee in terror.
Although all seems to have been lost, Aslan ultimately proves to be
greater than the villainous witch.

Like Aslan’s followers in Lewis’ allegory, Elisha’s servant despaired
when he got up one morning to see himself and Elisha surrounded by an
enemy army. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” he exclaimed (2 Kings
6:15). The prophet’s response was calm: “Don’t be afraid . . . . Those
who are with us are more than those who are with them” (v. 16). Elisha
then prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord , so that he may see” (v. 17). So,
“the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills
full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha” (v. 17).
Although things at first seemed bleak to the servant’s eye, God’s
power ultimately proved greater than the enemy horde.

Our difficult circumstances may lead us to believe all is lost, but
God desires to open our eyes and reveal that He is greater.
