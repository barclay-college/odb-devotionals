God With Us

Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall
call His name Immanuel, which is translated, “God with us.” —
Matthew 1:23

Today's Scripture: Matthew 1:18-25

His presence in the room was obvious. Everyone else was dressed rather
formally. He had on a pair of jeans, a T-shirt, and a weathered
baseball cap. I couldn’t help but notice him as I addressed students
that day in a seminary chapel in Bucharest, Romania. I have no idea
why he didn’t conform to the norms of seminary attire, but I do
remember his name.

At the close of the meeting he came up to introduce himself. When I
asked him his name, he answered, “Immanuel.” I was surprised by his
answer and asked if he knew what that meant; he unashamedly replied,
“Yes—‘God with us!’”

I’ve often thought about that young man and how he stood out in the
crowd. Just as Jesus came to bring the presence of God into our
world—“Immanuel . . . God with us” (Matt. 1:23)—so too we are called
to bring His presence into our world. Jesus made that clear when He
said, “As the Father has sent Me, I also send you” (John 20:21).

This Christmas, we can give the gift of God’s likeness through us.
When our lives reflect the God who lives in us, we can be different
from the world, and that difference can bless others with the
transforming presence of His love and grace.
