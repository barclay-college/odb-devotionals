Come Sit a Spell

Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.
Luke 19:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 19:1–9

When I was a kid, our family made a monthly excursion from Ohio to
West Virginia to visit my maternal grandparents. Every time we arrived
at the door of their farmhouse, Grandma Lester would greet us with the
words, “Come on in and sit a spell.” It was her way of telling us to
make ourselves comfortable, stay a while, and share in some “catching-
up” conversation.

Life can get pretty busy. In our action-oriented world, it’s hard to
get to know people. It’s tough to find time to ask someone to “sit a
spell” with us. We can get more done if we text each other and get
right to the point.

But look at what Jesus did when He wanted to make a difference in the
life of a tax collector. He went to Zacchaeus’s house to “sit a
spell.” His words, “I must stay at your house” indicate that this was
no quick stopover (Luke 19:5). Jesus spent time with him, and
Zacchaeus’s life was turned around because of this time with Jesus.

On the front porch of my grandmother’s house were several chairs—a
warm invitation to all visitors to relax and talk. If we’re going to
get to know someone and to make a difference in their life—as Jesus
did for Zacchaeus—we need to invite them to “come sit a spell.”

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, as I look around at those who share this life with me, help
me to make time to spend with them—for encouragement, challenge, and
perhaps just plain conversation.

The best gift you can give to others may be your time.
