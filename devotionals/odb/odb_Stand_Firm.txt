Stand Firm

Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. —
1 Corinthians 15:58

Today's Scripture: Colossians 1:19-27

As our final project for a high school earth science class, a friend
and I built a stream table. With extensive help from my father, we
built a long plywood box with a hinge in the middle. Then we lined it
with plastic and filled it with sand. At one end we attached a hose.
At the other end was a drainage hole. After assembling all of it, we
raised one end of the stream table, turned on the water, and watched
as it created a path directly to the hole at the other end. The next
part of the experiment was to place a rock in the stream and watch how
it changed the path of the water.

This project taught me as much about life as it did about science. I
learned that I can’t change the direction things are going if I’m on
the bank of the river. I have to step into the stream of life and
stand there to divert the flow. That’s what Jesus did. The Bible
refers to salvation as a rock (2 Sam. 22:47; Ps. 62:2,6-7), and the
apostle Paul clarifies that Christ is that Rock (1 Cor. 10:4). God
placed Jesus in the stream of history to change its course.

When we remain steadfast in Christ, abounding in the work of the Lord,
God uses us to change the course of history through acts of obedience
that turn others to Him.
