Unseen Realities

Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.”
2 Kings 6:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 6:8–17

Stephen Cass, an editor at Discover magazine, was determined to
investigate some of the invisible things that are part of his daily
life. As he walked toward his office in New York City, he thought: “If
I could see radio waves, the top of the Empire State Building [with
its host of radio and TV antennas] would be lit like a kaleidoscopic
flare, illuminating the entire city.” He realized he was surrounded by
an invisible electromagnetic field of radio and TV signals, Wi-Fi, and
more.

Elisha’s servant learned about another kind of unseen reality one
morning—the invisible spiritual world. He awoke to find himself and
his master surrounded by the armies of Aram. As far as his eyes could
see, there were soldiers mounted on powerful warhorses (2 Kings 6:15)!
The servant was afraid, but Elisha was confident because he saw the
army of angels that surrounded them. He said: “Those who are with us
are more than those who are with them” (v. 16). Then he asked the Lord
to open his servant’s eyes so he too could see that the Lord had
surrounded their enemy and He was in control (v. 17).

Do you feel overpowered and helpless? Remember that God is in control
and fights for you. He “will command his angels concerning you to
guard you in all your ways” (Psalm 91:11).

Reflect & Pray

How can you learn to trust God’s supernatural help? How would trusting
Him more change the way you face difficulties?

Fear not for God is with us and for us.
