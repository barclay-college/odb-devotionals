Be Specific

What do you want Me to do for you? —
Mark 10:51

Today's Scripture: Mark 10:46-52

On the day before a major surgery, I shared with my friend that I was
really scared about the procedure. “What part scares you?” she
inquired. “I’m just so afraid that I won’t wake up from the
anesthesia,” I replied. Immediately, Anne prayed: “Father, you know
all about Cindy’s fear. Please calm her heart and fill her with Your
peace. And, Lord, please wake her up after surgery.”

I think God likes that kind of specificity when we talk to Him. When
Bartimaeus, the blind beggar, called out to Jesus for help, Jesus
said, “What do you want Me to do for you?” And the blind man said,
“Rabboni, that I may receive my sight!” Jesus said, “Go your way; your
faith has made you well” (Mark 10:51-52).

We don’t need to beat around the bush with God. While there may be a
time to pray poetically as David did, there are also times to say
bluntly, “God, I’m so sorry for what I just said,” or to say simply,
“Jesus, I love You because . . . .” Being specific with God can even
be a sign of faith because we are acknowledging that we know we’re not
talking to a far-off Being but to a real Person who loves us
intimately.

God is not impressed by a flurry of fanciful words. He is listening
for what our heart is saying.

Reflect & Pray

Poetic prose in prayer to God Is not what He requires; Instead,
specific heartfelt pleas Are what the Lord desires. —Sper

The heart of prayer is prayer from the heart.
