Shocking Accessibility

You received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba,
Father.” —
Romans 8:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:14-17,24-26

When John F. Kennedy was president of the US, photographers sometimes
captured a winsome scene. Seated around the president’s desk in the
Oval Office, cabinet members are debating matters of world
consequence. Meanwhile, a toddler, the 2-year-old John-John, crawls
around and inside the huge presidential desk, oblivious to White House
protocol and the weighty matters of state. He is simply visiting his
daddy.

That is the kind of shocking accessibility conveyed in the word Abba
when Jesus said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for You” (Mark
14:36). God may be the sovereign Lord of the universe, but through His
Son, God became as approachable as any doting human father. In Romans
8, Paul brings the image of intimacy even closer. God’s Spirit lives
inside us, he says, and when we do not know what we ought to pray “the
Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot
be uttered” (v.26).

Jesus came to demonstrate that a perfect and holy God welcomes pleas
for help from a widow with two mites and a Roman centurion and a
miserable publican and a thief on a cross. We need only call out
“Abba” or, failing that, simply groan. God has come that close to us.

Reflect & Pray

We want to talk to God, but it can be difficult to find words to
express the emotions of our heart. The Discovery Series booklet Let’s
Pray may help. Read it online at www.discoveryseries.org/hp135

Prayer is an intimate conversation with our God.
