Always Loved, Always Valued

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or
hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
Romans 8:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:31–39

We serve a God who loves us more than our work.

Oh, it’s true that God wants us to work to feed our families and to
responsibly take care of the world He created. And He expects us to
serve the weak, hungry, naked, thirsty, and broken people around us
even as we remain alert to those who have not yet responded to the
Holy Spirit’s tug on their lives.

And yet we serve a God who loves us more than our work.

We must never forget this because there may come a time when our
ability to “do for God” is torn from us by health or failure or
unforeseen catastrophe. It is in those hours that God wants us to
remember that He loves us not for what we do for Him but because of
who we are: His children! Once we call on the name of Christ for
salvation, nothing—“trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or
nakedness or danger or sword”—will ever again separate us “from the
love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 8:35, 39).

When all we can do or all we have is taken from us, then all He wants
us to do is rest in our identity in Him.

Reflect & Pray

Father, help us never lose sight of the unconditional love You have
for us, and let us hold on to that hope when our labor—and the fruit
of our labor—are gone.

The reason we exist is to be in fellowship with God.
