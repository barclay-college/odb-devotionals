Another Side of Comfort

Hear the word of the Lord.
Jeremiah 7:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 7:1–11

The theme for our adult camp was “Comfort My People.” Speaker after
speaker spoke words of assurance. But the last speaker drastically
changed the tone. He chose Jeremiah 7:1–11 and the topic “Wake Up from
Slumber.” Without mincing words and yet with love, he challenged us to
wake up and turn away from our sins.

“Don’t hide behind the grace of God and continue to live in secret
sin,” he exhorted, like the prophet Jeremiah. “We boast, ‘I am a
Christian; God loves me; I fear no evil,’ yet we do all kinds of
evil.”

We knew he cared about us, yet we shifted uncomfortably in our seats
and listened to our own Jeremiah declare, “God is loving, but He is
also a consuming fire! (see Heb. 12:29). He will never condone sin!”

Jeremiah of old quizzed the people, “Will you steal and murder, commit
adultery and perjury . . . follow other gods you have not known, and
then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and
say, ‘We are safe’—safe to do all these detestable things?” (7:9–10).

This speaker’s brand of “Comfort My People” was another side of God’s
comfort. Like a bitter herb that heals malaria, his words were
spiritually curative. When we hear hard words, instead of walking
away, may we respond to their healing effect.
