Don’t Touch the Fence!

The Lord . . . sent word to them . . . again and again, because he had
pity on his people.
2 Chronicles 36:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 18:1-12

As a young girl I went with my parents to visit my great-grandmother,
who lived near a farm. Her yard was enclosed by an electric fence,
which prevented cows from grazing on her grass. When I asked my
parents if I could play outside, they consented, but explained that
touching the fence would result in an electric shock.

Unfortunately I ignored their warning, put a finger to the barbed
wire, and was zapped by an electrical current strong enough to teach a
cow a lesson. I knew then that my parents had warned me because they
loved me and didn’t want me to get hurt.

When God saw the ancient Israelites in Jerusalem crafting and
worshiping idols, He “sent word to them . . . again and again, because
he had pity on his people” (2 Chron. 36:15). God spoke through the
prophet Jeremiah, but the people said, “We will continue with our own
plans” (Jer. 18:12). Because of this, God allowed Nebuchadnezzar to
destroy Jerusalem and capture most of its inhabitants.

Maybe God is warning you today about some sin in your life. If so, be
encouraged. That is proof of His compassion for us (Heb. 12:5-6). He
sees what’s ahead and wants us to avoid the problems that will come.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give me the ability to hear not just Your words but also Your
heart. Help me to learn from the mistakes of those whose stories You
have given us. Help me to honor You with my life.

God’s warnings are to protect us, not to punish us.
