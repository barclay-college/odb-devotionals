Better Than Before

[Naaman’s] flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child. —
2 Kings 5:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 5:1-15

As infants, my children had nearly perfect skin. Their flesh was
soft—they had no dry elbows or rough patches on their feet. Smooth and
new, it contrasted with mine, which was marked by years of various
scars and callouses.

As a mighty warrior and the commander of the Syrian army, Naaman may
have had scuffed skin and battle scars, but he also had a serious skin
disease—leprosy. When a servant suggested that the prophet Elisha
could heal him, Naaman visited him. He followed Elisha’s instructions,
and his diseased flesh became “like the flesh of a little child” (2
Kings 5:14). This cure left Naaman better off both physically and
spiritually. After being healed, he proclaimed, “Now I know that there
is no God in all the earth, except in Israel” (v.15). Through this
miraculous experience, he learned that there is only one true God
(1 Cor. 8:6).

Like Naaman, we can learn important lessons about God as a result of
our life experiences. Receiving a blessing may show us about His mercy
and goodness (Matt. 7:11). Surviving or enduring a trial may help us
see God’s sufficiency and care. Growing in knowledge of Him (2 Peter
3:18) will always leave us better off spiritually than we were before.

Father, help me to learn more about You as I travel through this
world. Let this knowledge inspire fresh praise in my heart and a

Lessons about God are embedded in life experiences.
