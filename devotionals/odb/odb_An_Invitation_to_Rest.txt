An Invitation to Rest

I will give you rest.
Matthew 11:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 21:1-5

At a friend’s bedside in a hospital emergency ward, I was moved by the
sounds of suffering I heard from other patients in pain. As I prayed
for my friend and for the ailing patients, I realized anew how
fleeting our life on earth is. Then I recalled an old country song by
Jim Reeves that talks about how the world is not home for us—we’re
“just a-passin’ through.”

Our world is full of weariness, pain, hunger, debt, poverty, disease,
and death. Because we must pass through such a world, Jesus’
invitation is welcome and timely: “Come to me, all you who are weary
and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28). We need this
rest.

There is hardly a funeral ceremony I’ve attended where John’s vision
of “a new heaven and a new earth” (Rev. 21:1-5) is not quoted, and it
certainly holds relevance for funerals.

But I believe the passage is more for the living than the dead. The
time to heed Jesus’ invitation to come rest in Him is while we are
still living. Only then can we be entitled to the promises in
Revelation. God will dwell among us (v. 3). He will wipe away our
tears (v. 4). There will be “no more death or mourning or crying or
pain” (v. 4).

Accept Jesus’ invitation and enter His rest!

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, this life can be wonderful, but it can also be so
hard. Thank You for Your Spirit’s presence with us now. And thank You
too for the reality of eternal life with You.

When you’re weary in life’s struggles, find your rest in the Lord.
