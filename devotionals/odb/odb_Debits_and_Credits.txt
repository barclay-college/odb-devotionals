Debits and Credits

In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome
the world. —NIV
John 16:33

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 16:1-11

When my husband was teaching an accounting class at a local college, I
took one of the tests just for fun to see how well I could do. The
results were not good. I answered every question wrong. The reason for
my failure was that I started with a faulty understanding of a basic
banking concept. I reversed debits and credits.

We sometimes get our debits and credits confused in the spiritual
realm as well. When we blame Satan for everything that goes
wrong—whether it’s bad weather, a jammed printer, or financial
trouble—we’re actually giving him credit that he doesn’t deserve. We
are ascribing to him the power to determine the quality of our lives,
which he does not have. Satan is limited in time and space. He has to
ask God’s permission before he can touch us (Job 1:12; Luke 22:31).

However, as the father of lies and prince of this world (John 8:44;
16:11), Satan can cause confusion. Jesus warned of a time when people
would be so confused that they wouldn’t know right from wrong (16:2).
But He added this assurance: “The prince of this world now stands
condemned” (v. 11 niv).

Problems will disrupt our lives, but they cannot defeat us. Jesus has
already overcome the world. To Him goes all the credit.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Father, for being Lord over everything in our lives. We
praise You for overcoming the world through Your Son.

While Satan accuses and confuses, God controls.
