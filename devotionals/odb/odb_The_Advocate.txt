The Advocate

When he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the
truth.
John 16:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 16:7–15

As I boarded the airplane to study in a city a thousand miles from
home, I felt nervous and alone. But during the flight, I remembered
how Jesus promised His disciples the comforting presence of the Holy
Spirit.

Jesus’s friends must have felt bewildered when He told them, “It is
for your good that I am going away” (John 16:7). How could they who
witnessed His miracles and learned from His teaching be better off
without Him? But Jesus told them that if He left, then the
Advocate—the Holy Spirit—would come.

Jesus, nearing His last hours on earth, shared with His disciples (in
John 14–17, today known as the “Farewell Discourse”) to help them
understand His death and ascension. Central in this conversation was
the coming Holy Spirit, an advocate who would be with them (14:16–17),
teaching (15:15), testifying (v. 26), and guiding them (16:13).

We who have accepted God’s offer of new life have been given this gift
of His Spirit living within us. From Him we receive so much: He
convicts us of our sins and helps us to repent. He brings us comfort
when we ache, strength to bear hardships, wisdom to understand God’s
teaching, hope and faith to believe, love to share.

We can rejoice that Jesus sent us the Advocate.

Heavenly Father, You sent Your Son to save us and Your Spirit to

Your goodness and love.

The Holy Spirit fills Jesus’s followers.
