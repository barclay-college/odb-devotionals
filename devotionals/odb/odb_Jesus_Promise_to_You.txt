Jesus’ Promise to You

He will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever.
John 14:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:15–21, 25–27

Jason wailed as his parents handed him over to Amy. It was the two-
year-old’s first time in the nursery while Mom and Dad attended the
service—and he was not happy. Amy assured them he’d be fine. She tried
to soothe him with toys and books, by rocking in a chair, walking
around, standing still, and talking about what fun he could have. But
everything was met with bigger tears and louder cries. Then she
whispered five simple words in his ear: “I will stay with you.” Peace
and comfort quickly came.

Jesus offered His friends similar words of comfort during the week of
His crucifixion: “The Father . . . will give you another advocate to
help you and be with you forever—the Spirit of truth” (John 14:16–17).
After His resurrection He gave them this promise: “Surely I am with
you always, to the very end of the age” (Matthew 28:20). Jesus was
soon to ascend to heaven, but He would send the Spirit to “stay” and
live within His people.

We experience the Spirit’s comfort and peace when our tears flow. We
receive His guidance when we’re wondering what to do (John 14:26). He
opens our eyes to understand more of God (Ephesians 1:17–20), and He
helps us in our weakness and prays for us (Romans 8:26–27).

He stays with us forever.
