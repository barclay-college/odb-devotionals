“So Helpful”

Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
Romans 12:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 4:7–11

The caller to the Christian radio station said that his wife was
coming home from the hospital following surgery. Then he shared
something that spoke deeply to my heart: “Everyone in our church
family has been so helpful in taking care of us during this time.”

When I heard this simple statement, it reminded me of the value and
necessity of Christian hospitality and care. I began to think that the
love and support of fellow believers for one another is one of the
greatest ways to demonstrate the life-changing power of the gospel.

In First Peter, the apostle was writing a letter to be circulated
among the first-century churches in what’s now the country of Turkey.
In that letter, he compelled his readers to do something that his
friend Paul wrote about in Romans 12:13: “Practice hospitality.” Peter
said, “Love each other deeply . . . offer hospitality,” and he told
them to use the gifts God gave them to “serve others” (1 Peter
4:8–10). These are clear directions to all believers in Jesus for how
we’re to treat fellow believers.

All of us know people like that caller’s wife—those who need someone
to come alongside and show concern and Christlike love. In God’s
strength, may we be among the ones who are noted for being “so
helpful.”

Reflect & Pray

What has God equipped you to do for those in need? How has God
revealed His own hospitable nature?

Loving God, help me to look around for people who need an encouraging
word or action from me. Then help me offer hospitality to them.
