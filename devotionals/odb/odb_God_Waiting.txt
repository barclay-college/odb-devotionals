God Waiting

The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, . . . but is
longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that
all should come to repentance. —
2 Peter 3:9

Today's Scripture: John 14:1-6

During the Christmas season we wait. We wait in traffic. We wait in
checkout lines to purchase gifts. We wait for family to arrive. We
wait to gather around a table filled with our favorite foods. We wait
to open presents lovingly chosen.

All of this waiting can be a reminder to Christians that Christmas is
a celebration of waiting for something much more important than
holiday traditions. Like the ancient Israelites, we too are waiting
for Jesus. Although He already came as the long-awaited Messiah, He
has not yet come as ruler over all the earth. So today we wait for
Christ’s second coming.

Christmas reminds us that God also waits . . . He waits for people to
see His glory, to admit that they are lost without Him, to say yes to
His love, to receive His forgiveness, to turn away from sin. While we
wait for His second coming, He waits for repentance. What seems to us
like God’s slowness in coming is instead His patience in waiting (2
Peter 3:9).

The Lord is waiting to have a relationship with those He loves. He
made the first move when He came as baby Jesus and the sacrificial
Lamb. Now He waits for us to welcome Him into our lives as Savior and
Lord.
