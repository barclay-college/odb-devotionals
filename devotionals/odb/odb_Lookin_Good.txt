Lookin’ Good!

Let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works. —
Hebrews 10:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 10:19-25

After trying on my new sunglasses in the car one day, my daughter
handed them back and said, “These are not sunglasses, Mom. They’re
just fashion lenses. Let me guess,” she teased, “you bought them
because you look cute in them.”

Okay, I have to admit—my daughter knows me. I hadn’t given a passing
thought to UV rays or even whether those glasses would actually block
the sun. I just really liked the way they looked on me.

Most of us like to look good. We want to appear that we “have it all
together”—with no struggles or fears or temptations or heartaches.

Trying to maintain a façade of perfection on our spiritual journey
doesn’t help us or our fellow travelers. But sharing our lives with
others in the body of Christ benefits us as well as others. When we
are a bit more transparent, we may find people who are struggling in a
similar situation. And as we enjoy a growing fellowship with God and
become more aware of our own brokenness and inadequacy, God is able to
use us more fully to help others.

Let’s allow God to strip away any pretense and “let us consider how we
may spur one another on toward love and good deeds” (Heb. 10:24 niv).

Reflect & Pray

Wearing a mask that shows everything’s fine Says that life’s struggles
are not God’s design; But when we’re open, transparent, and true,
People will trust God to meet their needs too. —Sper

Believers stand strong when they don’t stand alone.
