Let It Go

Say, “The Lord has need of it,” and immediately he will send it here.

Mark 11:3

Today's Scripture: Mark 11:1-11

Many years ago, when a young friend asked if he could borrow our car,
my wife and I were hesitant at first. It was our car. We owned it, and
we depended on it. But we soon felt convicted to share it with him
because we knew that God wanted us to care for others. So we handed
the keys over to him, and he traveled to a church 30 miles away to
conduct a youth rally. The meeting was used by the Lord to bring teens
to Christ.

Jesus instructed His disciples to take another man’s donkey. The Son
of God told His men to “loose it and bring it” to Him (Mark 11:2). If
someone objected, they were to say, “The Lord has need of it,” and
they would then be permitted to lead it away. That donkey carried
Christ into Jerusalem on what we call Palm Sunday.

There’s a lesson here for us to consider. We all have things that we
hold dear. We may have thought, I could never part with that. It may
be a new truck, a coat, some other possession, or our precious few
free hours during the week. Will we be open to give when someone
obviously needs something we have?

If you sense that the Spirit is speaking to you, let your time or
possession go, as the owner released his animal to Jesus. He will then
be glorified as He deserves!

Reflect & Pray

Make me a channel of blessing today, Make me a channel of blessing, I
pray; My life possessing, my service blessing, Make me a channel of
blessing today. —Smyth

God gives us all we need, so we can give to others in their need.
