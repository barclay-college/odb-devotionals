More than a Symbol

In humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own
interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
Philippians 2:3–4

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Samuel 23:13–17

On the verge of making team history, University of Iowa basketball
star Jordan Bohannon intentionally missed the free throw that would
have broken a twenty-five-year-old school record. Why? In 1993, days
after Iowa’s Chris Street had made thirty-four free throws in a row,
he lost his life in a car crash. Bohannon chose to honor Street’s
memory by not breaking his record.

Bohannon showed a keen awareness of things more important than his own
advancement. We see similar values in the life of the young warrior
David. Hiding in a cave with his ragtag army, David longed for a drink
from the well in his hometown of Bethlehem, but the dreaded
Philistines occupied the area (2 Samuel 23:14–15).

In a stunning act of bravery, three of David’s warriors “broke through
the Philistine lines,” got the water, and brought it to David. But
David couldn’t bring himself to drink it. Instead, he “poured it out
before the Lord ,” saying, “Is it not the blood of men who went at the
risk of their lives?” (vv. 16–17).

In a world that often rewards those who seize whatever they can grasp,
how powerful acts of love and sacrifice can be! Such deeds are much
more than mere symbols.

Reflect & Pray

Instead of advancing your own agenda, how can you celebrate someone
else and their efforts? How do our acts of love reflect God’s own?

Father, guide my heart today. Rearrange my priorities so that I value
the needs of others as well as my own.
