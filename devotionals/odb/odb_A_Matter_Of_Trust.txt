A Matter Of Trust

Let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; let them ever shout
for joy, because You defend them. —
Psalm 5:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 5

A news item from Australia told the story of Pascale Honore, a
paraplegic woman who, after 18 years of being confined to a
wheelchair, has taken up surfing. How?

Ty Swan, a young surfer, straps her to his back with duct tape. After
getting the balance perfect, Ty paddles out into the ocean so they can
catch a wave and Pascale can experience the exhilaration of surfing.
This requires a tremendous amount of trust; so many things could go
wrong. Yet her confidence in Ty is enough to enable her to enjoy a
dream come true, in spite of the danger.

Life is like that for the follower of Christ. We live in a dangerous
world, filled with unpredictable challenges and unseen perils. Yet, we
have joy because we know Someone who is strong enough to carry us
through the churning waves of life that threaten to overwhelm us. The
psalmist wrote, “Let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; let
them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; let those also who
love Your name be joyful in You” (Ps. 5:11).

In the face of life’s great dangers and challenges, we can know a joy
borne out of our trust in God. His strength is more than enough!

Reflect & Pray

I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee, Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me, Wilt be with me to the end. —Stead

Our faith is stretched by exchanging our weakness for God’s strength.
