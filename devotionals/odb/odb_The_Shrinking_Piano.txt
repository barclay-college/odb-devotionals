The Shrinking Piano

He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until
the day of Christ Jesus.
Philippians 1:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 1:1–11

For three consecutive years, my son participated in a piano recital.
The last year he played, I watched him mount the steps and set up his
music. He played two songs and then sat down next to me and whispered,
“Mom, this year the piano was smaller.” I said, “No, it’s the same
piano you played last year. You’re bigger! You’ve grown.”

Spiritual growth, like physical growth, often happens slowly over
time. It is an ongoing process that involves becoming more like Jesus,
and it happens as we are transformed through the renewing of our minds
(Rom. 12:2).

When the Holy Spirit is at work in us, we may become aware of sin in
our lives. Wanting to honor God, we make an effort to change.
Sometimes we experience success, but at other times, we try and fail.
If it seems like nothing changes, we get discouraged. We may equate
failure with a lack of progress, when it’s often proof that we are in
the middle of the process.

Spiritual growth involves the Holy Spirit, our willingness to change,
and time. At certain points in our lives, we may look back and see
that we have grown spiritually. May God give us the faith to continue
to believe that “He who began a good work in [us] will carry it on to
completion until the day of Christ Jesus” (Phil. 1:6).

Dear God, give me a desire to grow spiritually. I want to honor You

Spiritual growth is a process.
