Be Present

They sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and
no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very
great. —
Job 2:13

Today's Scripture: Job 2:3-13

After 20 children and 6 staff members were murdered in a Connecticut
school, the entire nation was stunned that such a horrific thing could
happen. Everyone focused on the tragedy and the questions surrounding
it: What kind of person would do such a thing, and why? How can we
prevent it from happening again? How can we help the survivors? Amid
the chaos, an unlikely group moved in and made a difference.

From Chicago came dogs— specially trained golden retrievers that
offered nothing except affection. Dogs don’t speak; they simply offer
their presence. Children traumatized by the violence opened up to
them, expressing fears and emotions they had not spoken to any adult.
Tim Hetzner of Lutheran Church Charities said, “The biggest part of
their training is just learning to be quiet.”

As we learn from the book of Job, people in grief do not always need
words. Sometimes they need someone to sit silently with them, to
listen when they need to speak, and to hug them when their sorrow
turns to sobs.

God may not intervene to change circumstances and He may not explain
suffering, but He comforts us through the presence of other believers
(Col. 4:8).

Reflect & Pray

He’s with us in the valley, Amid the darkest night He tells us in our
sorrow; Faith will give way to sight. —D. DeHaan

Listening may be the most loving and Christlike thing you do today.
