Do We Matter?

Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing
for joy and be glad all our days.
Psalm 90:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 90:1–2, 10–17

For some months now I’ve been corresponding with a young man who’s
thinking deeply about faith. On one occasion he wrote, “We’re no more
than teeny, tiny, infinitesimal blips on the timeline of history. Do
we matter?”

Moses, Israel’s prophet, would agree: “Our days . . . quickly pass,
and we fly away” (Psalm 90:10). The brevity of life can worry us and
cause us to wonder if we matter.

We do. We matter because we’re deeply, eternally loved by the God who
made us. In this poem, Moses prays, “Satisfy us . . . with your
unfailing love” (v. 14). We matter because we matter to God.

We also matter because we can show God’s love to others. Though our
lives are short, they’re not meaningless if we leave a legacy of God’s
love. We’re not here on earth to make money and retire in style, but
to “show God” to others by showing them His love.

And finally, though life here on earth is transient, we’re creatures
of eternity. Because Jesus rose from the dead, we’ll live forever.
That’s what Moses meant when he assured us that God will “satisfy us
in the morning with [His] unfailing love.” On that “morning” we’ll
rise to live and love and be loved forever. And if that doesn’t create
meaning, I don’t know what does.
