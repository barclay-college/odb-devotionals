Purpose in Routine

I run with purpose in every step. —
1 Corinthians 9:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 9:19-27

A rolling-ball clock in the British Museum struck me as a vivid
illustration of the deadening effects of routine. A small steel ball
traveled in grooves across a tilted steel plate until it tripped a
lever on the other side. This tilted the plate back in the opposite
direction, reversed the direction of the ball and advanced the clock
hands. Every year, the steel ball traveled some 2,500 miles back and
forth, but never really went anywhere.

It’s easy for us to feel trapped by our daily routine when we can’t
see a larger purpose. The apostle Paul longed to be effective in
making the gospel of Christ known. “I do not run like someone running
aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air” (1 Cor. 9:26
niv). Anything can become monotonous—traveling, preaching, teaching,
and especially being confined in prison. Yet Paul believed he could
serve Christ his Lord in every situation.

Routine becomes lethal when we can’t see a purpose in it. Paul’s
vision reached beyond any limiting circumstance because he was in the
race of faith to keep going until he crossed the finish line. By
including Jesus in every aspect of his life, Paul found meaning even
in the routine of life.

And so can we.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give us renewed vision and energy to pursue the goal of making
Christ known in the midst of our daily routine.

Jesus can transform our routine into meaningful service for Him.
