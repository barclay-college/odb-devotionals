The Dalton Gang

He who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from
death. —
James 5:20

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 4:10-19

The Dalton brothers were infamous outlaws during the late 1800s in the
US. They started out on the right side of the law as officers. But
then they followed a gradual descent into crime and became known for
bank and train robberies. Their day of reckoning came when they tried
to hold up two banks at once. Hearing of the robberies, the
townspeople armed themselves and began to fire on the Dalton Gang.
When the smoke cleared, Emmett Dalton was the sole survivor.

After serving 15 years in the penitentiary, Emmett was pardoned and
set free. While in prison, he had come to see the error of his ways.
So when he was released, he wanted to deter young people from a life
of crime. Drawing from his own experience, Emmett wrote and starred in
a film about the Dalton Gang in which he showed the folly of being an
outlaw. In many ways, Emmett’s film was telling others: “Do not enter
the path of the wicked” (Prov. 4:14).

In a similar way, when we have sinned but have genuinely repented and
experienced God’s forgiveness, we can tell our own story. We can
encourage others not to make the same mistakes we have made. James
wrote, “He who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a
soul from death” (5:20).

Reflect & Pray

If others learn from our mistakes, And it saves them from the pain
That we ourselves experienced— Then it wasn’t all in vain. —Sper

When we learn from our mistakes, we are less likely to repeat them.
