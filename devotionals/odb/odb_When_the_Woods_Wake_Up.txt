When the Woods Wake Up

I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will
live, even though they die.
John 11:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 11:14-27

Through cold, snowy winters, the hope of spring sustains those of us
who live in Michigan. May is the month when that hope is rewarded. The
transformation is remarkable. Limbs that look lifeless on May 1 turn
into branches that wave green leafy greetings by month’s end. Although
the change each day is imperceptible, by the end of the month the
woods in my yard have changed from gray to green.

God has built into creation a cycle of rest and renewal. What looks
like death to us is rest to God. And just as rest is preparation for
renewal, death is preparation for resurrection.

I love watching the woods awaken every spring, for it reminds me that
death is a temporary condition and that its purpose is to prepare for
new life, a new beginning, for something even better. “Unless a kernel
of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed.
But if it dies, it produces many seeds” (John 12:24).

While pollen is a springtime nuisance when it coats my furniture and
makes people sneeze, it reminds me that God is in the business of
keeping things alive. And after the pain of death, He promises a
glorious resurrection for those who believe in His Son.
