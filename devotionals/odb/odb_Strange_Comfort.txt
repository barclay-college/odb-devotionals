Strange Comfort

Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.
2 Kings 6:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 6:15–17

The verse on the card Lisa received didn’t seem to match her
situation: “Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and
saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha”
(2 Kings 6:17). I have cancer! she thought in confusion. I’ve just
lost a baby! A verse about angel soldiers doesn’t apply.

Then the “angels” began to show up. Cancer survivors gave her their
time and a listening ear. Her husband got released early from an
overseas military assignment. Friends prayed with her. But the moment
she most felt God’s love was when her friend Patty walked in with two
boxes of tissues. Placing them on the table, she started crying. Patty
knew. She’d endured miscarriages too.

“That meant more than anything,” Lisa says. “The card made sense now.
My ‘angel soldiers’ had been there all along.”

When an army besieged Israel, a host of literal angels protected
Elisha. But Elisha’s servant couldn’t see them. “What shall we do?” he
cried to the prophet (v. 15). Elisha simply prayed, “Open his eyes,
Lord , so that he may see” (v. 17).

When we look to God, our crisis will show us what truly matters and
that we’re not alone. We learn that God’s comforting presence never
leaves us. He shows us His love in infinitely surprising ways.

Reflect & Pray

What’s your first reaction when you receive bad news? When you endured
a crisis, how did you view God in new ways?

Loving God, thank You for the complete reliability of Your presence.
Open my eyes so that I may see You in a new way today.
