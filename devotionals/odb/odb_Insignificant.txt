Insignificant

The Word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. —
Luke 3:2

Today's Scripture: Luke 3:2-6,15-18

“Movers and shakers” are people climbing the ladder of influence and
success. Luke 3 mentions seven prominent leaders who exercised control
in the society of their time. Roman Emperor Tiberias Caesar held the
power of life and death over people in his far-flung empire. Pontius
Pilate represented Rome as governor of Judea; while Herod, Philip, and
Lysanias kept people in line at the regional level. Annas and Caiaphas
served as high priests, taking their religious authority seriously.

While these power brokers flexed their political muscles, “the Word of
God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness” (v.2). Who
could seem less important than this obscure man living in the desert
and listening for God’s voice? What could John the Baptist possibly
accomplish by “preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of
sins”? (v.3). Yet multitudes came to John seeking truth, turning from
their wrongs, and wondering if he could be the Messiah (vv.7,15). John
told them, “One mightier than I is coming . . . . He will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and fire” (v.16).

John’s life helps us understand what it means to be significant in
God’s eyes. Like John, may everything we say and do point others to
Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help us to surrender our desire for influence and success to
You. May our heart’s desire ever be to be used by You to further Your
kingdom. Make our lives a living testimony of You.

Our surrender to God precedes His significant work in our life.
