Aim High

—
2 Corinthians 13:11

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 5:12–6:3

When my daughter and her family were in town for a visit, I had a
chance to take my son and two sons-in-law out for a “guy” outing.

We decided that while the ladies were shopping, we would go to a
firing range and practice shooting. We rented two pistols and took aim
at our targets. While shooting, all four of us discovered that on one
of the firearms the sight was set too low. If we aimed using that
sight, we hit the bottom of the target. We had to aim high in order to
hit anywhere near the bull’s-eye.

Isn’t life a lot like that? If we set our sights too low, we really
don’t accomplish all that we can. Sometimes we have to aim high in
order to reach a desired goal.

What should be our aim in life? How high should we point our
ambitions? Well, since Scripture is our true guide, we will shoot for
nothing but spiritual maturity. In fact, in Paul’s farewell to the
people of Corinth, he said, “Aim for perfection” (2 Cor. 13:11 NIV).
And we also have the high aim of these words from the lips of Jesus,
“You shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect”
(Matt. 5:48).

Perfection is a lofty target, and we won’t attain it in this life. But
if we want to honor God and get close to that high goal, we need to
aim high.

Reflect & Pray

O to be like Thee, blessed Redeemer, This is my constant longing and
prayer; Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures, Jesus, Thy
perfect likeness to wear. —Chisholm

Conversion is the miracle of a moment; maturing takes a lifetime.
