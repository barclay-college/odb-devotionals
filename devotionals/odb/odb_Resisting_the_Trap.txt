Resisting the Trap

Sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must
rule over it.
Genesis 4:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 4:1-8

A Venus flytrap can digest an insect in about 10 days. The process
begins when an unsuspecting bug smells nectar on the leaves that form
the trap. When the insect investigates, it crawls into the jaws of the
plant. The leaves clamp shut within half a second and digestive juices
dissolve the bug.

This meat-eating plant reminds me of the way sin can devour us if we
are lured into it. Sin is hungry for us. Genesis 4:7 says, “If you do
not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to
have you.” God spoke these words to Cain just before he killed his
brother Abel.

Sin may try to entice us by tempting us with a new experience,
convincing us that living right doesn’t matter, or appealing to our
physical senses. However, there is a way for us to rule over sin
instead of letting it consume our lives. The Bible says, “Walk by the
Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh” (Gal.
5:16). When we face temptation, we don’t face it alone. We have
supernatural assistance. Relying on God’s Spirit supplies the power to
live for Him and others.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, at times I let down my guard and indulge in sin. Please help
me to listen to Your warnings and obey Your Word. Protect me from my
own impulses and conform me to Your image. Thank You for Your work in
me.

We fall into temptation when we don’t flee from it.
