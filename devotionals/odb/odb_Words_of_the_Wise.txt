Words of the Wise

Words of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard. —nkjv
Ecclesiastes 9:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 9:13-18

My niece’s husband recently wrote these words on a social media site:
“I would say a lot more online if it weren’t for this little voice
that prompts me not to. As a follower of Jesus, you might think that
little voice is the Holy Spirit. It isn’t. It’s my wife, Heidi.”

With the smile comes a sobering thought. The cautions of a discerning
friend can reflect the wisdom of God. Ecclesiastes 9 says that the
“words of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard” (v. 17 nkjv).

Scripture warns us not to be wise in our own eyes or proud (Prov. 3:7;
Isa. 5:21; Rom. 12:16). In other words, let’s not assume that we have
all the answers! Proverbs 19:20 says, “Listen to advice and accept
discipline, and at the end you will be counted among the wise.”
Whether it is a friend, a spouse, a pastor, or a co-worker, God can
use others to teach us more of His wisdom.

“Wisdom reposes in the heart of the discerning,” declares the book of
Proverbs (14:33). Part of recognizing the Spirit’s wisdom is
discovering how to listen and learn from each other.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for Your Word that teaches me how to love You and
others. Thank You also for the people You place in my life to remind
me of Your truth.

True wisdom begins and ends with God.
