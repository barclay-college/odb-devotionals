Acts of Kindness

[Tabitha] was always doing good and helping the poor.
Acts 9:36

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 9:32–42

“Estera, you got a present from our friend Helen!” my mom told me when
she got home from work. Growing up we didn’t have much, so receiving a
present in the mail was like a second Christmas. I felt loved,
remembered, and valued by God through this wonderful woman.

The poor widows Tabitha (Dorcas) made clothes for must have felt the
same way. She was a disciple of Jesus living in Joppa who was well
known in the community for her acts of kindness. She was “always doing
good and helping the poor” (Acts 9:36). Then she got sick and passed
away. At the time, Peter was visiting a nearby city, so two believers
went after him and begged him to come to Joppa.

When Peter arrived, the widows Tabitha had helped showed him the
evidence of her kindness—“the robes and other clothing that [she] had
made” (v. 39). We don’t know if they asked him to intervene, but led
by the Holy Spirit Peter prayed and God brought her back to life! The
result of God’s kindness was that “this became known all over Joppa,
and many people believed in the Lord” (v. 42).

As we’re kind to those around us, may they turn their thoughts to God
and feel valued by Him.
