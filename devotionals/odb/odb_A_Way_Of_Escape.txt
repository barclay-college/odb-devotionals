A Way Of Escape

[God will] make the way of escape, that [we] may be able to bear it. —
1 Corinthians 10:13

Today's Scripture: Matthew 4:1-11, 1 Corinthians 10:12-13

Highway 77, which passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West
Virginia, features a series of runaway truck ramps. These semi-paved
exits appear in an area of the highway where the altitude drops nearly
1,300 feet over the course of about 6 miles. This steep descent
combined with the road’s winding path can create problems for
motorists—especially truck drivers.

Just as a runaway truck needs an escape route from a highway, we also
need “a way of escape” when out-of-control desires threaten our
spiritual well-being. When we face temptation, “[God will] make the
way of escape, that [we] may be able to bear it” (1 Cor. 10:13). God
enables us to say “no” to enticement through the power of His Word.
Jesus conquered Satan’s temptation relating to food, authority, and
trust by quoting verses from Deuteronomy (Matt. 4:4-10). Scripture
helped Him resist the devil despite the effects of a 40-day fast in
the wilderness.

When we are tempted, we may feel like disaster is just around the
bend. Memories of past failure and isolation from others can intensify
this feeling. However, we can trust God in moments of temptation; He
is faithful. He will provide a way for us to resist sin’s allure.

Reflect & Pray

I need Thee every hour, stay Thou near by; Temptations lose their
pow’r when Thou art nigh. I need Thee, O I need Thee; Every hour I
need Thee. —Hawks/Lowry

The best way to escape temptation is to run to God.
