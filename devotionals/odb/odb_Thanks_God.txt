Thanks, God!

Oh, give thanks to the Lord! —
Psalm 105:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 105:1-5

At RBC Ministries, our human resources team has developed an effective
and encouraging program that centers around gratefulness.

When an employee notices something good another employee does here at
the office, he or she can take a special “Thank You” card provided by
human resources and write a note of appreciation. It’s a good feeling
to walk into your office and find one of those cards on your desk.

Isn’t it great to be thanked for a job well done? Doesn’t a good,
hearty “thank you” brighten your day? And doesn’t it make your
relationships a little more special—just to know that your work is not
being taken for granted?

Everybody loves to be thanked. Even God. Our heavenly Father finds
pleasure in our expression of thanks to Him. It’s His will that we
tell Him “Thank You.” “Give thanks in all circumstances,” Paul said,
“for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thess. 5:18 niv).
The writer of Hebrews took it a step further by saying, “Let us be
thankful, and so worship God” (12:28 niv).

Keep looking for ways to improve your relationship with God. Don’t
forget what may be the most basic way to worship and honor Him: Tell
Him “Thanks.”

Reflect & Pray

Then let us adore and give Him His right, All glory and power, all
wisdom and might, All honor and blessing, with angels above, And
thanks never ceasing for infinite love. —Wesley

The worship most acceptable to God comes from a thankful heart.
