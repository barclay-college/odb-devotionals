Seen by God

She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: “You are the God who
sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.”
Genesis 16:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 16:7–14

My first pair of eyeglasses opened my eyes to a bold world. I’m
nearsighted, meaning objects close up are sharp and defined. Without
my glasses, however, items across a room or in the distance are a
blur. At age twelve, with my first pair of eyeglasses, I was shocked
to see clearer words on blackboards, tiny leaves on trees and, perhaps
most important, big smiles on faces.

As friends smiled back when I greeted them, I learned that to be seen
was as great a gift as the blessing of seeing.

The slave Hagar realized that as she fled from her mistress Sarai’s
unkindness. Hagar was a “nobody” in her culture, pregnant and alone,
fleeing to a desert without help or hope. Seen by God, however, she
was empowered, in return, to see Him. No longer a vague concept, God
became real to her, so real that she gave God a name, El Roi, which
means “You are the God who sees me.” She said, “I have now seen the
One who sees me” (Genesis 16:13).

Our seeing God sees each of us too. Feeling unseen, alone, or like a
nobody? God sees you and your future. In return, may we see in Him our
ever-present hope, encouragement, salvation, and joy—both for today
and for our future. Praise Him today for this gift of amazing sight,
to see the one true and Living God.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I’m just one person in a big world, but I thank You for looking
from on high and seeing me—so that I may see You.

God knows my name and sees me.
