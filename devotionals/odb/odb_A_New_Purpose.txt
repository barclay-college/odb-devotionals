A New Purpose

“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for
people.”
Mark 1:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 1:16–22

Jacob Davis was a tailor with a problem. It was the height of the Gold
Rush in the 1800s American West and the gold miners’ work pants kept
wearing out. His solution? Davis went to a local dry goods company
owned by Levi Strauss, purchased tent cloth, and made work pants from
that heavy, sturdy material—and blue jeans were born. Today, denim
jeans in a variety of forms (including Levi’s) are among the most
popular clothing items in the world, and all because tent material was
given a new purpose.

Simon and his friends were fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. Then Jesus
arrived and called them to follow Him. He gave them a new purpose. No
longer would they fish for fish. As Jesus told them, “Come, follow me,
. . . and I will send you out to fish for people” (Mark 1:17).

With this new purpose set for their lives, these men were taught and
trained by Jesus so that, after His ascension, they could be used by
God to capture the hearts of people with the message of the cross and
resurrection of Christ. Today, we follow in their steps as we share
the good news of Christ’s love and salvation.

May our lives both declare and exhibit this love that can change the
lives, purposes, and eternal destinies of others.

Reflect & Pray

Help me, Lord, to represent You well so that others might be drawn to
Your love and salvation.

With our new life in Christ we have been given a new purpose.
