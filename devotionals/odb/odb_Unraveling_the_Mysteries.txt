Unraveling the Mysteries

I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every wrong
path.
Psalm 119:104

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:97–104

I have always enjoyed the wit and insight of Peanuts creator, Charles
Schulz. One of my favorite cartoons drawn by him appeared in a book
about young people in the church. It shows a young man holding a Bible
as he tells a friend on the phone, “I think I’ve made one of the first
steps toward unraveling the mysteries of the Old Testament . . . I’m
starting to read it!” (Teen-Ager Is Not a Disease).

Psalm 119 overflows with the writer’s hunger to understand and
experience the power of God’s Word each day. “Oh, how I love your law!
I meditate on it all day long” (v. 97). This eager pursuit leads to
growing wisdom, understanding, and obedience to the Lord (vv. 98–100).

The Bible doesn’t contain a magic formula for “unraveling the
mysteries” in its pages. The process is more than mental and requires
a response to what we read. While some passages may remain puzzling to
us, we can embrace those truths we clearly understand, and say to the
Lord, “How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my
mouth! I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every
wrong path” (vv. 103–104).

A wonderful journey of discovery awaits us in God’s Word.
