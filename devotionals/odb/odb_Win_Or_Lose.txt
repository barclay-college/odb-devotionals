Win Or Lose

I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept
the faith. —
2 Timothy 4:7

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 4:1-8

During the 2009 college football season, University of Texas
quarterback Colt McCoy began every post-game interview by thanking God
for the opportunity to play. When he was injured early in the national
championship game, he was forced to watch from the sidelines as his
team lost.

The apostle Paul experienced God’s deliverance many times, but he
didn’t insist on things going his way. From prison in Rome he wrote to
Timothy: “I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the
time of my departure is at hand” (2 Tim. 4:6). Some might say that
Paul had failed to accomplish his goals and that his life was ending
in defeat. But he saw it differently: “I have fought the good fight, I
have finished the race, I have kept the faith” (v.7). He looked
forward to an eternal crown (v.8).

As we walk with God, we can praise Him for His faithfulness—win or
lose.

Reflect & Pray

I can always count on God, my heavenly Father, For He changes not; He
always is the same. Yesterday, today, forever, He is faithful, And I
know He loves me, praise His holy name! —Felten

In every change He faithful will remain. —Katharina von Schlegel
