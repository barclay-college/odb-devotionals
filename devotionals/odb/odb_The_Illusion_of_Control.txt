The Illusion of Control

You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.
James 4:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 4:13–17

Ellen Langer’s 1975 study titled The Illusion of Control examined the
level of influence we exert over life’s events. She found that we
overestimate our degree of control in most situations. The study also
demonstrated how reality nearly always shatters our illusion.

Langer’s conclusions are supported by experiments carried out by
others since the study was published. However, James identified the
phenomenon long before she named it. In James 4, he wrote, “Now
listen, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that
city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.’ Why, you
do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are
a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes” (vv. 13–14).

Then James provides a cure for the delusion, pointing to the One who’s
in absolute control: “Instead, you ought to say, ‘If it is the Lord’s
will, we will live and do this or that’” (v. 15). In these few verses,
James summarized both a key failing of the human condition and its
antidote.

May we understand that our fate doesn’t rest in our own hands. Because
God holds all things in His capable hands, we can trust His plans!

Reflect & Pray

In what ways have you given in to the illusion that you’re in control
of your fate? How can you turn over your plans to God and leave your
future in His hands?

Heavenly Father, I place all of my life in Your loving hands. Thank
You for Your good plans for me.
