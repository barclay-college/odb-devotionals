A Widow’s Choice

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
Psalm 34:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:15-22

When a good friend suddenly lost her husband to a heart attack, we
grieved with her. As a counselor, she had comforted many others. Now,
after 40 years of marriage, she faced the unwelcome prospect of
returning to an empty house at the end of each day.

In the midst of her grief, our friend leaned on the One who “is close
to the brokenhearted.” As God walked with her through her pain, she
told us she would choose to “wear the label widow proudly,” because
she felt it was the label God had given her.

All grief is personal, and others may grieve differently than she
does. Her response doesn’t diminish her grief or make her home less
empty. Yet it reminds us that even in the midst of our worst sorrows,
our sovereign and loving God can be trusted.

Our heavenly Father suffered a profound separation of His own. As
Jesus hung on the cross He cried out, “My God, my God, why have you
forsaken me?” (Matt. 27:46). Yet He endured the pain and separation of
crucifixion for our sins out of love for us!

He understands! And because “the Lord is close to the brokenhearted”
(Ps. 34:18), we find the comfort we need. He is near.
