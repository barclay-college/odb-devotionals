Fame and Humility

He humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a
cross!
Philippians 2:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:1–11

Many of us are obsessed with fame—either with being famous ourselves
or with following every detail of famous people’s lives. International
book or film tours. Late-night show appearances. Millions of followers
on Twitter.

In a recent study in the US, researchers ranked the names of famous
individuals using a specially developed algorithm that scoured the
Internet. Jesus topped the list as the most famous person in history.

Yet Jesus was never concerned about obtaining celebrity status. When
He was here on earth, He never sought fame (Matt. 9:30; John
6:15)—although fame found Him all the same as news about Him quickly
traveled throughout the region of Galilee (Mark 1:28; Luke 4:37).

Wherever Jesus went, crowds soon gathered. The miracles He performed
drew people to Him. But when they tried to make Him a king by force,
He slipped away by Himself (John 6:15). United in purpose with His
Father, He repeatedly deferred to the Father’s will and timing (4:34;
8:29; 12:23). “He humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even
death on a cross” (Phil. 2:8).

Fame was never Jesus’s goal. His purpose was simple. As the Son of
God, He humbly, obediently, and voluntarily offered Himself as the
sacrifice for our sins.

Reflect & Pray

You are to be celebrated, Lord, above all others. You have been highly
exalted and given a name that is above every name. One day every knee
will bow and every tongue confess that You are Lord.

Jesus came not to be famous, but to humbly offer Himself as the
sacrifice for our sins.
