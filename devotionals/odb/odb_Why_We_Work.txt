Why We Work

Not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ,
doing the will of God from the heart. —
Ephesians 6:6

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 6:5-9

In the late 1660s, Sir Christopher Wren was commissioned to re-design
St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. According to legend, one day he
visited the construction site of this great edifice and was
unrecognized by the workers. Wren walked about the site, asking
several of the men what they were doing. One worker replied, “I am
cutting a piece of stone.” A second worker responded, “I’m earning
five shillings two pence a day.” A third, however, had a different
perspective: “I am helping Christopher Wren build a magnificent
cathedral to the glory of God.” What a contrast in the attitude and
motivation of that worker!

Why we do what we do is extremely important, particularly when it
comes to our working lives and careers. That’s why Paul challenged the
Ephesians to do their work, “not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but
as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with
goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men” (Eph. 6:6-7).

If we do our work merely to earn a paycheck or satisfy a supervisor,
we will fall short of the highest motivation—doing our best as
evidence of our devotion to God. So, why do we work? As that laborer
told Wren, we work “to the glory of God.”
