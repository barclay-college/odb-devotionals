Can We Relax?

Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
John 14:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:25–31

Darnell entered the physical therapist’s office knowing he would
experience a lot of pain. The therapist stretched and bent his arm and
held it in positions it hadn’t been in for months since his injury.
After holding each uncomfortable position for a few seconds, she
gently told him: “Okay, you can relax.” He said later, “I think I
heard that at least fifty times in each therapy session: ‘Okay, you
can relax.’ ”

Thinking of those words, Darnell realized they could apply to the rest
of his life as well. He could relax in God’s goodness and faithfulness
instead of worrying.

As Jesus neared His death, He knew His disciples would need to learn
this. They’d soon face a time of upheaval and persecution. To
encourage them, Jesus said He would send the Holy Spirit to live with
them and remind them of what He had taught (John 14:26). And so He
could say, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. . . . Do not
let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid” (v. 27).

There’s plenty we could be uptight about in our everyday lives. But we
can grow in our trust in God by reminding ourselves that His Spirit
lives in us—and He offers us His peace. As we draw on His strength, we
can hear Him in the therapist’s words: “Okay, you can relax.”

Reflect & Pray

What causes you stress? What characteristics of God can help you learn
to trust Him more?

Teach me, Jesus, to trust Your faithfulness, to know Your presence, to
experience Your peace—to relax.
