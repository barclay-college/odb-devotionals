Called By A New Name

When Jesus looked at him, He said, “. . . you shall be called Cephas”
(which is translated, A Stone). —
John 1:42

Today's Scripture: John 1:35-42

In the article “Leading by Naming,” Mark Labberton wrote about the
power of a name. He said: “I can still feel the impact of a musical
friend who one day called me ‘musical.’ No one had ever called me
that. I didn’t really play an instrument. I was no soloist. Yet . . .
I instantly felt known and loved. . . . [He] noticed, validated, and
appreciated something deeply true about me.”

Perhaps this is what Simon felt when Jesus renamed him. After Andrew
was convinced that Jesus was the Messiah, he immediately found his
brother Simon and brought him to Jesus (John 1:41-42). Jesus peered
into his soul and validated and appreciated something deeply true
about Simon. Yes, Jesus saw the failure and impetuous nature that
would get him into trouble. But more than that He saw the potential of
Simon to become a leader in the church. Jesus named him Cephas—Aramaic
for Peter—a rock (John 1:42; see Matt. 16:18).

And so it is with us. God sees our pride, anger, and lack of love for
others, but He also knows who we are in Christ. He calls us justified
and reconciled (Rom. 5:9-10); forgiven, holy, and beloved (Col. 2:13;
3:12); chosen and faithful (Rev. 17:14). Remember how God sees you and
seek to let that define who you are.
