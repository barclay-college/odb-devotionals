Surprised by Grace

I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace.
Ephesians 3:7

Today's Scripture: Acts 9:1-19

A woman from Grand Rapids, Michigan, fell asleep on the couch after
her husband had gone to bed. An intruder sneaked in through the
sliding door, which the couple had forgotten to lock, and crept
through the house. He entered the bedroom where the husband was
sleeping and picked up the television set. The sleeping man woke up,
saw a figure standing there, and whispered, “Honey, come to bed.” The
burglar panicked, put down the TV, grabbed a stack of money from the
dresser, and ran out.

The thief was in for a big surprise! The money turned out to be a
stack of Christian pamphlets with a likeness of a $20 bill on one side
and an explanation of the love and forgiveness God offers to people on
the other side. Instead of the cash he expected, the intruder got the
story of God’s love for him.

I wonder what Saul expected when he realized it was Jesus appearing to
him on the road to Damascus, since he had been persecuting and even
killing Jesus’ followers? (Acts 9:1-9). Saul, later called Paul, must
have been surprised by God’s grace toward him, which he called “a
gift”: “I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace
given me through the working of his power” (Eph. 3:7).

Have you been surprised by God’s gift of grace in your life as He
shows you His love and forgiveness?

Reflect & Pray

Lord, Your grace is amazing to me. I’m grateful that in spite of my
sinfulness, You offer Your love to me.

Never measure God’s unlimited power by your limited expectations.
