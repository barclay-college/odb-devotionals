Always With You

Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go. —
Genesis 28:15

Today's Scripture: Psalm 25:4-10

The highway that winds around the southern shore of Lake Michigan can
be treacherous in the winter. One weekend as we were driving back to
Grand Rapids from Chicago, a buildup of snow and ice slowed traffic,
caused numerous accidents, and almost doubled our drive time. We were
relieved as we eased off the expressway onto our final road. It was
then that my husband said out loud, “Thanks, Lord. I think I can take
it from here.”

Just as he finished saying the words, our car spun around 180 degrees.
As we came to a stop, hearts pounding, we could just imagine God
saying: “Are you sure?”

Why do we sometimes try to go it alone in life when at every moment we
have access to God? He said: “I am with you and will keep you wherever
you go” (Gen. 28:15). And He assures us: “I will never leave you nor
forsake you” (Heb. 13:5).

Scottish mathematician, theologian, and preacher Thomas Chalmers
(1780–1847) wrote: “When I walk by the wayside, He is along with me.
When I enter into company, amid all my forgetfulness of Him, He never
forgets me. . . . Go where I will, He tends me, and watches me, and
cares for me.”

What a comfort to know that God is always with us—we don’t need to go
through life alone!

Reflect & Pray

As I travel down life’s pathway, Jesus keeps me day by day; And
although the road is winding, Yet, with Him I need not stray.
—Bradshaw

God’s presence brings great comfort.
