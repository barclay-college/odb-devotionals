On Listening

Do not be rash with your mouth, and let not your heart utter anything
hastily before God. —
Ecclesiastes 5:2

Today's Scripture: Exodus 16:1-8

God gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason,” the saying goes.
The ability to listen is an essential life skill. Counselors tell us
to listen to each other. Spiritual leaders tell us to listen to God.
But hardly anyone says, “Listen to yourself.” I’m not suggesting that
we have an inner voice that always knows the right thing to say. Nor
am I saying we should listen to ourselves instead of to God and
others. I’m suggesting that we need to listen to ourselves in order to
learn how others might be receiving our words.

The Israelites could have used this advice when Moses was leading them
out of Egypt. Within days of their miraculous deliverance, they were
complaining (Ex. 16:2). Although their need for food was legitimate,
their way of expressing the need was not (v.3).

Whenever we speak out of fear, anger, ignorance, or pride—even if what
we say is true—those who listen will hear more than our words. They
hear emotion. But they don’t know whether the emotion comes from love
and concern or disdain and disrespect, so we risk misunderstanding. If
we listen to ourselves before speaking out loud, we can judge our
hearts before our careless words harm others or sadden our God.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to think before I speak, to check my heart. Help me to
control my tongue and to express myself clearly so that I won’t cause
dissension. Set a guard on my lips.

Words spoken rashly do more harm than good.
