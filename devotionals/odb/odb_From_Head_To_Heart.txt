From Head To Heart

Your Word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.
—
Psalm 119:11

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:9-16

My childhood piano teacher was a stickler for memorization. Being able
to play a piece without error was not enough. I had to play several
pieces flawlessly by memory. Her reasoning was this: She didn’t want
her students to say, when asked to play, “I’m sorry, I don’t have my
music with me.”

As a child, I also memorized Bible passages, including Psalm 119:11.
Due to my limited understanding, I believed that simple memorization
would keep me from sin. I worked hard at memorizing verses, and I even
won a Moody Bible Story Book as an award.

Although memorizing the Bible is a good habit to develop, it’s not the
act of memorizing that keeps us from sin. As I learned soon after my
winning efforts, having the words of Scripture in my head made little
difference in my behavior. In fact, instead of victory over sin,
knowledge alone generated feelings of guilt.

Eventually I realized that the Word of God had to spread through my
whole being. I needed to internalize Scripture, to hide it “in my
heart” the way a musician does a piece of music. I had to live the
Bible as well as I could quote it. As God’s Word spreads from our
heads to our hearts, sin loses its power over us.

Reflect & Pray

O Lord, my God, may Your Word become so much a part of me that
obedience comes naturally and cheerfully from my heart. Change me and
mold me into Your image.

Let God’s Word fill your memory, rule your heart, and guide your life.
