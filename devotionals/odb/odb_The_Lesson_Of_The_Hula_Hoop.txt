The Lesson Of The Hula Hoop

Let us not grow weary while doing good. —
Galatians 6:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 6:34-44

One of my favorite childhood toys is making a comeback—the hula hoop.
My friend Suzi and I spent hours on the front lawn perfecting our
technique and competing to see which of us could keep a hoop circling
our waist longer. This year I relived that part of my childhood. While
sitting in a park, I watched as children of all ages and sizes tried
their hardest to keep hula hoops from falling to the ground. They
twisted and turned with all their strength, but despite their exertion
the hoops landed on the ground. Then a young woman picked up a hoop.
With hardly any motion, she moved it smoothly and rhythmically up and
down from her waist to her shoulders and back to her waist. Her
success depended on strategic movement, not vigorous motion.

In our spiritual lives, we can expend all kinds of energy trying to
keep up with others in service to God. But working to exhaustion is
not a virtue (Gal. 6:9). Before feeding thousands of people with only
five loaves and two fish (Mark 6:38-44), Jesus called His disciples
away to rest, proving that He doesn’t need our frantic exertion to
accomplish His work. The truth Jesus taught His disciples, He wants to
teach us: Quiet obedience accomplishes more than wild activity.

Reflect & Pray

Help me, Lord, not to compare myself and what I do with others. May I
serve where You want me to serve and do it in Your strength. I love
You and give myself to You.

Jesus wants willingness, not weariness.
