Sandcastles

Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. —
Luke 12:34

Today's Scripture: Luke 12:22-34

When our kids were young, my wife Martie and I enjoyed family
vacations in Florida visiting our parents. It was especially wonderful
to be there in the warmth for a brief respite from the Michigan wind-
chill factor. I couldn’t wait to just relax on the beach with a good
book. But my kids had other ideas. They wanted my help building
sandcastles. Reluctantly, I’d get up to help, only to be quickly
consumed by the project at hand. Before I knew it, I had spent hours
creating an impressive castle—not thinking that it was only a matter
of time until the tide would wash away all my hard work.

We often make the same mistake in life, spending lots of time and
energy building our own little “castles” of stuff and basking in our
accomplishments. It all may seem worthwhile, but in the end it’s
worthless.

In Luke 12, Jesus challenged His followers to sell their possessions
and give to the poor, “For where your treasure is, there your heart
will be also” (v.34). In other words, the way we spend our time and
resources says a lot about our eternal perspective. As the old hymn
goes, “Only one life, ’twill soon be past; only what’s done for Christ
will last.” So what have you done today that will last for eternity?

Reflect & Pray

Who measures how we’ve done in life And judges our success? Our God,
who gives rewards to those Who live in righteousness. —Branon

God wants you to spend your time and treasure building His kingdom,
not your own.
