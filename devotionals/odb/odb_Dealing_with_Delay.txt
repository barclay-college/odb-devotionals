Dealing with Delay

So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God.
Genesis 45:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 45:1–8

A global computer system outage causes widespread flight
cancellations, stranding hundreds of thousands of passengers at
airports. During a winter storm, multiple auto accidents close major
highways. The person who promised to send a reply “right away” has
failed to do so. Delays can often produce anger and frustration, but
as followers of Jesus, we have the privilege of looking to Him for
help.

One of the Bible’s great examples of patience is Joseph, who was sold
to slave traders by his jealous brothers, falsely accused by his
employer’s wife, and imprisoned in Egypt. “But while Joseph was there
in the prison, the Lord was with him” (Genesis 39:20–21). Years later,
when Joseph interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams, he was made second in
command in Egypt (ch. 41).

The most remarkable fruit of his patience occurred when his brothers
came to buy grain during a famine. “I am your brother Joseph,” he told
them, “the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and
do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to
save lives that God sent me ahead of you. . . . So then, it was not
you who sent me here, but God”  (45:4–5, 8).

In all our delays, brief or long, may we, like Joseph, gain patience,
perspective, and peace as we trust in the Lord.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, in all of our delays may we trust Your faithful hand

Confidence in God enables us to live out our faith patiently.
