Fellowship with Jesus

I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
Philippians 3:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:7–14

I’ll never forget the time I had the privilege of sitting next to
Billy Graham at a dinner. I was honored but also somewhat nervous
about what would be appropriate to say. I thought it would be an
interesting conversation starter to ask what he loved most about his
years of ministry. Then I awkwardly started to suggest possible
answers. Was it knowing presidents, kings, and queens? Or preaching
the gospel to millions of people around the world?

Before I had finished offering suggestions, Rev. Graham stopped me.
Without hesitation he said, “It has been my fellowship with Jesus. To
sense His presence, to glean His wisdom, to have Him guide and direct
me—that has been my greatest joy.” I was instantly convicted and
challenged. Convicted because I’m not sure that his answer would have
been my answer, and challenged because I wanted it to be.

That’s what Paul had in mind when he counted his greatest achievements
to be of no worth compared to the “surpassing worth of knowing Christ
Jesus my Lord” (Philippians 3:8). Think of how rich life would be if
Jesus and our fellowship with Him was our highest pursuit.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, forgive me for chasing after things that matter far less than my
fellowship with You. Thank You that You stand ready to enrich my life
with Your presence and power.

To remain faithful where God has placed you, give Christ first place
in your heart.
