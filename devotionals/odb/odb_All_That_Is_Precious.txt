All That Is Precious

Coming to Him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen
by God and precious. —
1 Peter 2:4

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 2:1-10

Throughout my life, I’ve accumulated a lot of stuff. I have boxes of
things that at one time were important but over time have lost their
intrigue. And, as an unrepentant collector, I’ve realized that the
thrill is in searching for and acquiring a new piece to add to the
collection. Then my attention turns toward the hunt for the next item.

While we pile up many things that are important to us, very little of
it is really precious. In fact, over time I have learned that the most
precious things in life are not material items at all. Rather, it’s
the people who have loved me and built into my life who are precious.
When I find my heart saying, “I don’t know what I’d do without them,”
I know that they are indeed precious to me.

So when Peter refers to Jesus as “a chief cornerstone, elect,
precious” (1 Peter 2:6), it should resonate in our hearts that He is
truly precious—our prized possession above everything and everyone
else. Where would we be today without the constant unfailing
companionship of His faithful presence, wise and perfect guidance,
merciful patience, comfort, and transforming reproof? What would we do
without Him? I can’t even imagine!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help us not to focus on fleeting treasures but on You, our most
precious treasure. Teach us the joy of reveling in You and Your loving
presence and provision in our lives.

Of all that is precious, Jesus tops the list.
