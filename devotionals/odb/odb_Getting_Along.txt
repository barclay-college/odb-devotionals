Getting Along

Fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love. —
Philippians 2:2

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:1-11

I love being with people . . . most of the time. There is a special
joy that resonates in our hearts when we are with people we enjoy. But
unfortunately we are not always with those we like to be around.
Sometimes people can be prickly, which may be why someone has said,
“The more I get to know people, the more I love my dog!” When we don’t
find joy in a relationship, we tend to blame the other person; then we
excuse ourselves as we exit to be with people we like.

The apostle Paul asks us to lovingly engage with our brothers and
sisters in Christ. In fact, he calls all of us to be “of one accord,”
to look out “for the interests of others,” and to “let this mind be in
you which was also in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 2:2-5). Think about it.
Jesus gave up His own prerogatives and privileges for us; He chose to
live as a servant and paid the ultimate sacrifice that He might bring
us into a joy-filled relationship with Him (see Heb. 12:2). And He did
all that in spite of our prickliness (see Rom. 5:8).

So next time you are with someone who is not easy to get along with,
ask Jesus to help you find a way to extend His love. In time, you
might be surprised by how God can change your attitude about people.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You that while I was still offensive to You, You saved me
with Your sacrificial love. Give me the same courage and grace to
extend to others the love that You have so graciously extended to me.

The key to getting along with others is having the mind of Christ.
