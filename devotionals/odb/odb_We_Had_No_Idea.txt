We Had No Idea

Carry each other’s burdens.
Galatians 6:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 6:2–10

Volunteers from a local church spent a frigid evening distributing
food to people in a low-income apartment complex. One woman who
received the food was overjoyed. She showed them her bare cupboard and
told them they were an answer to her prayers.

As the volunteers returned to the church, one woman began to cry.
“When I was a little girl,” she said, “that lady was my Sunday school
teacher. She’s in church every Sunday. We had no idea she was almost
starving!”

Clearly, these were caring people who were seeking ways to carry the
burdens of others, as Paul suggests in Galatians 6:2. Yet somehow they
hadn’t noticed the needs of this woman—someone they saw every
Sunday—and she hadn’t shared her needs. This can be a gentle reminder
for all of us to be more aware of those around us and, as Paul said,
to “do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the
family of believers” (6:10).

People who worship together have the privilege of assisting one
another so no one in the body of Christ goes without help. As we get
to know each other and care for each other, perhaps we won’t ever have
to say, “We had no idea.”

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me to notice the needs of those around me and to do
what I can to meet those needs in Your name.

Nothing costs as much as caring—except not caring.
