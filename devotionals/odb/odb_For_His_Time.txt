For His Time

My times are in your hands.
Psalm 31:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 1:2-4

When South African pastor Andrew Murray was visiting England in 1895,
he began to suffer pain from a previous back injury. While he was
recuperating, his hostess told him of a woman who was in great trouble
and wanted to know if he had any counsel for her. Murray said, “Give
her this paper which I have been writing for my own [encouragement].
It may be that she will find it helpful.” This is what Murray wrote:

“In time of trouble say:

First—God brought me here. It is by His will I am in this strait
place. In that I will rest.

Next—He will keep me in His love and give me grace in this trial to
behave as His child.

Then—He will make the trial a blessing, teaching me lessons He intends
me to learn, and working in me the grace He means to bestow.

Last—In His good time He can bring me out again—how and when He knows.

I am here—by God’s appointment, in His keeping, under His training,
for His time.”

We want the instant solution, the quick fix, but some things cannot be
disposed of so readily; they can only be accepted. God will keep us by
His love. By His grace, we can rest in Him.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, it’s hard to endure times of illness and suffering. Comfort
me and help me to trust You.

When God permits suffering, He also provides comfort.
