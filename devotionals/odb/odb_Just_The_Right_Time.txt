Just The Right Time

Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come. —
Hebrews 9:11

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 9:11-22

The conductor stood on the podium, his eyes scanning the choir and
orchestra. The singers arranged the music in their folders, found a
comfortable position for standing, and held the folder where they
could see the conductor just over the top. Orchestra members
positioned their music on the stand, found a comfortable position in
their seats, and then sat still. The conductor waited and watched
until everyone was ready. Then, with a downbeat of his baton, the
sounds of Handel’s “Overture to Messiah” filled the cathedral.

With the sound swirling around me, I felt I was immersed in
Christmas—when God, at just the right moment, signaled the downbeat
and set in motion an overture that started with the birth of the
Messiah, the “High Priest of the good things to come” (Heb. 9:11).

Every Christmas, as we celebrate Christ’s first coming with glorious
music, I’m reminded that God’s people, like choir and orchestra
members, are getting ready for the next downbeat of the conductor when
Christ will come again. On that day, we will participate with Him in
the final movement of God’s symphony of redemption—making all things
new (Rev. 21:5). In anticipation, we need to keep our eyes on the
conductor and make sure we are ready.

Reflect & Pray

Sound the soul-inspiring anthem, Angel hosts, your harps attune;
Earth’s long night is almost over, Christ is coming—coming soon!
—Macomber

The advent of Christ celebrates His birth and anticipates His return.
