Gentleness

Be completely humble and gentle.
Ephesians 4:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:1–6

The troubles of life can make us cranky and out of sorts, but we
should never excuse these bouts of bad behavior, for they can wither
the hearts of those we love and spread misery all around us. We have
not fulfilled our duty to others until we have learned to be pleasant.

The New Testament has a word for the virtue that corrects our
unpleasantness—gentleness, a term that suggests a kind and gracious
soul. Ephesians 4:2 reminds us, “Be completely humble and gentle.”

Gentleness is a willingness to accept limitations and ailments without
taking out our aggravation on others. It shows gratitude for the
smallest service rendered and tolerance for those who do not serve us
well. It puts up with bothersome people—especially noisy, boisterous
little people; for kindness to children is a crowning mark of a good
and gentle person. It speaks softly in the face of provocation. It can
be silent; for calm, unruffled silence is often the most eloquent
response to unkind words.

Jesus is “gentle and humble in heart” (Matt. 11:29). If we ask Him, He
will, in time, recreate us in His image. Scottish author George
MacDonald says, “[God] would not hear from [us] a tone to jar the
heart of another, a word to make it ache . . . . From such, as from
all other sins, Jesus was born to deliver us.”
