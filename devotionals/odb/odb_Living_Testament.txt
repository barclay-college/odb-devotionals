Living Testament

Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the
dead according to my gospel. —
2 Timothy 2:8

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 2:1-10

Watchman Nee was arrested for his faith in Christ in 1952, and he
spent the rest of his life in prison. He died in his jail cell on May
30, 1972. When his niece came to collect his few possessions, she was
given a scrap of paper that a guard had found by his bed. On it was
written his life’s testimony:

“Christ is the Son of God who died for the redemption of sinners and
was resurrected after three days. This is the greatest truth in the
universe. I die because of my belief in Christ—Watchman Nee.”

Tradition says that the apostle Paul also was martyred for his faith
in Christ. In a letter written shortly before his death, Paul exhorted
his readers: “Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was
raised from the dead according to my gospel, for which I suffer
trouble . . . ; but the Word of God is not chained” (2 Tim. 2:8-9).

We may not be called upon to be martyred as witnesses to the reality
of Christ—as millions of His followers through the centuries have
been—but we are all called to be a living testament of Jesus’ work on
our behalf. No matter the outcome, from a heart of gratitude for God’s
gracious gift we can tell others what Jesus has done for us.
