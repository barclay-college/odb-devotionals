The Best Strategy for Life

Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves.
Ecclesiastes 4:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 4:1–12

As we watched my daughter’s basketball game from the bleachers, I
heard the coach utter a single word to the girls on the court:
“Doubles.” Immediately, their defensive strategy shifted from one-on-
one to two of their players teaming against their tallest ball-holding
opponent. They were successful in thwarting her efforts to shoot and
score, eventually taking the ball down the court to their own basket.

When Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, grapples with the toils and
frustrations of the world, he too acknowledges that having a companion
in our labors yields “a good return” (4:9). While a person battling
alone “may be overpowered, two can defend themselves” (v. 12). A
friend nearby can help us up when we fall down (v. 10).

Solomon’s words encourage us to share our journey with others so we
don’t face the trials of life alone. For some of us, that requires a
level of vulnerability we’re unfamiliar or uncomfortable with. Others
of us crave that kind of intimacy and struggle to find friends with
whom to share it. Whatever the case, we mustn’t give up in the effort.

Solomon and basketball coaches agree: having teammates around us is
the best strategy for facing the struggles that loom large on the
court and in life. Lord, thank You for the people You put in our lives
to encourage and support us.
