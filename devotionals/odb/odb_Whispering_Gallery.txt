Whispering Gallery

In the multitude of words sin is not lacking, but he who restrains his
lips is wise. —
Proverbs 10:19

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 10:11-23

London’s domed St. Paul’s Cathedral has an interesting architectural
phenomenon called the “whispering gallery.” One Web site explains it
this way: “The name comes from the fact that a person who whispers
facing the wall on one side can be clearly heard on the other, since
the sound is carried perfectly around the vast curve of the Dome.”

In other words, you and a friend could sit on opposite sides of
architect Sir Christopher Wren’s great cathedral and carry on a
conversation without having to speak above a whisper.

While that may be a fascinating feature of St. Paul’s Cathedral, it
can also be a warning to us. What we say about others in secret can
travel just as easily as whispers travel around that gallery. And not
only can our gossip travel far and wide, but it often does great harm
along the way.

Perhaps this is why the Bible frequently challenges us about the ways
we use words. The wise King Solomon wrote, “In the multitude of words
sin is not lacking, but he who restrains his lips is wise” (Prov.
10:19).

Instead of using whispers and gossip that can cause hurt and pain
while serving no good purpose, we would do better to restrain
ourselves and practice silence.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help us bridle what we say And tend our conversations, Avoiding
careless gossiping That murders reputations. —Sper

Gossip ends at a wise person’s ears.
