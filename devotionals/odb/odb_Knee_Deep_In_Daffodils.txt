Knee-Deep In Daffodils

The Lord is risen indeed! —
Luke 24:34

Today's Scripture: Luke 24:13-34

When the first flowers of spring bloomed in our yard, my 5-year-old
son waded into a patch of daffodils. He noticed some debris from
plants that had expired months before and remarked, “Mom, when I see
something dead, it reminds me of Easter because Jesus died on the
cross.” I replied, “When I see something alive—like the daffodils—it
reminds me that Jesus came back to life!”

One reason we know Jesus rose from the grave is that, according to the
gospel of Luke, He approached two travelers headed to Emmaus 3 days
after His crucifixion. Jesus walked with them; He ate dinner with
them; He even gave them a lesson in Old Testament prophecy (24:15-27).
This encounter showed the travelers that Jesus conquered the grave—He
had risen from the dead. As a result, the pair returned to Jerusalem
and told the disciples, “The Lord is risen indeed!” (v.34).

If Jesus had not come back to life, our faith as Christians would be
pointless, and we would still be under the penalty of our sin (1 Cor.
15:17). However, the Bible tells us that Jesus “was raised to life for
our justification” (Rom. 4:25 niv). Today, we can be right with God
because Jesus is alive!
