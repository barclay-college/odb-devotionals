Don’t Quit!

Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our
eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.
Hebrews 12:1-2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 12:1-11

In 1952 Florence Chadwick attempted to swim 26 miles from the coast of
California to Catalina Island. After 15 hours, a heavy fog began to
block her view, she became disoriented, and she gave up. To her
chagrin, Chadwick learned that she had quit just 1 mile short of her
destination.

Two months later Chadwick tried a second time to swim to Catalina
Island from the coast. Again a thick fog settled in, but this time she
reached her destination, becoming the first woman to swim the Catalina
Channel. Chadwick said she kept an image of the shoreline in her mind
even when she couldn’t see it.

When the problems of life cloud our vision, we have an opportunity to
learn to see our goal with the eyes of faith. The New Testament letter
to the Hebrews urges us to “run with perseverance the race marked out
for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith”
(12:1-2). When we feel like quitting, this is our signal to remember
not only what Jesus suffered for us but what He now helps us to
endure—until the day we see Him face to face.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, sometimes the challenges of life seem insurmountable.
Help me to fix my eyes on You and trust You. I’m thankful You are
bringing about Your good purposes in me.

We can finish strong when we focus on Christ.
