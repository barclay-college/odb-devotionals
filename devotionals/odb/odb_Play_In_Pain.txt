Play In Pain

Though He causes grief, yet He will show compassion. —
Lamentations 3:32

Today's Scripture: Lamentations 3:1-3, 25-33

Baseball Hall-of-Fame catcher Gary Carter was a follower of Jesus.
During his 19-year career, he drew strength and endurance from his
faith in God to compete day after day. In an article that appeared in
the Wall Street Journal shortly after Carter died of brain cancer at
age 57, writer Andrew Klavan told how Carter had influenced his life.

In the late 1980s, Klavan had sunk to a low point in his life. His
mind dwelt on suicide. Then he heard Carter interviewed after a game.
His team, the New York Mets, had won, and the aging catcher had helped
by running hard at a critical point in the game. Carter was asked how
he could do that with his aching knees. Klavan heard him say something
like this: “Sometimes you just have to play in pain.” That simple
statement helped draw Klavan out of his depression. “I can do that!”
he declared. Encouraged, he found hope—and later became a believer in
Christ.

The comforting truth behind Carter’s statement comes from
Lamentations. We may face sorrow, pain, and hardship, but we don’t
have to sink into self-pity. The same God who allows our suffering
also showers us with His compassion (Lam. 3:32). With God’s love
lifting us up, we can—if we have to—“play” in pain.

Reflect & Pray

Along life’s pathway troubles come That God will help us bear; Then we
can look beyond the pain To those who need our care. —Branon

God will either spare you from suffering or give you the grace to bear
it.
