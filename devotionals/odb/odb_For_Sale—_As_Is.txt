For Sale— ”As Is”

For You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood. —
Revelation 5:9

Today's Scripture: Revelation 5:1-12

A house listed for sale “As Is” usually means the seller is unable or
unwilling to spend any money to repair it or make it attractive. Any
necessary repairs or desired improvements are the responsibility of
the buyer after the purchase is complete. “As Is” on a real estate
listing is equivalent to saying, “Buyer beware. Home may require
significant further investment.”

How remarkable that when Jesus died, He paid the highest price for
each of us, regardless of our condition. Revelation 5 describes a
scene in heaven where only “The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root
of David” is found worthy to open and read a sealed scroll (vv.3-5).
He appears as a Lamb and becomes the object of praise in a new song,
“For You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of
every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made us kings
and priests to our God; and we shall reign on the earth” (vv.9-10).

Jesus Christ willingly purchased us for God with His blood. We were
bought “as is,” faults, defects, needed renovation included. By faith
we are now under His ownership, in the process of remodeling for God’s
glory. How wonderful that God knew us, loved us, and bought us just as
we are.

Reflect & Pray

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe. Sin had left a crimson stain; He
washed it white as snow. —Hall

God knows us inside and out. No renovation project is too big for Him.
