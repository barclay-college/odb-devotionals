Five-Minute Rule

He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise
their plea.
Psalm 102:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 102:1–17

I read about a five-minute rule that a mother had for her children.
They had to be ready for school and gather together five minutes
before it was time to leave each day.

They would gather around Mom, and she would pray for each one by name,
asking for the Lord’s blessing on their day. Then she’d give them a
kiss and off they’d run. Even neighborhood kids would be included in
the prayer circle if they happened to stop by. One of the children
said many years later that she learned from this experience how
crucial prayer is to her day.

The writer of Psalm 102 knew the importance of prayer. This psalm is
labeled, “A prayer of an afflicted person who has grown weak and pours
out a lament before the Lord.” He cried out, “Hear my prayer, Lord; .
. .  when I call, answer me quickly” (vv. 1–2). God looks down “from
his sanctuary on high, from heaven he [views] the earth” (v. 19).

God cares for you and wants to hear from you. Whether you follow the
five-minute rule asking for blessings on the day, or need to spend
more time crying out to Him in deep distress, talk to the Lord each
day. Your example may have a big impact on your family or someone
close to you.
