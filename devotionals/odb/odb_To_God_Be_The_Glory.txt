To God Be The Glory

Chenaniah, leader of the Levites, was instructor in charge of the
music, because he was skillful. —
1 Chronicles 15:22

Today's Scripture: 1 Chronicles 25:1-8

When Jason was asked to sing at a church he was visiting, he was
delighted to participate even though he wasn’t asked until a few
minutes before the service started. He chose a familiar hymn, “To God
Be the Glory,” because it was a song that was especially meaningful to
him. He practiced it a few times in the church basement and sang it
without accompaniment in the church service.

Several weeks later, Jason learned that some people in the church
didn’t appreciate his ministry. They thought he was showing off.
Because they did not know him, they wrongly assumed that he was
singing to impress them, not to honor the Lord.

From the Old Testament we learn that God appointed people with skill
to be involved in temple worship. From construction workers to worship
leaders—people were chosen based on their skill (1 Chron. 15:22;
25:1,7).

The Lord gave each of us different talents and spiritual gifts to be
used for His glory (Col. 3:23-24). When we serve with that purpose,
not to lift up ourselves, we don’t need to be concerned with what
others think. God gave His very best to us—His Son Jesus—and we honor
Him by giving our best to Him.

Reflect & Pray

The Master needs what you have to offer, No matter if you think it’s
small; His work on earth is done through His children, So give Him
your best, give your all. —Hess

We are at our best when we serve God from our hearts.
