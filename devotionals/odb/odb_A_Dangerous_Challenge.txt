A Dangerous Challenge

The battle is not yours, but God’s. —
2 Chronicles 20:15

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 20:1, 15-22

While millions watched on television, Nik Wallenda walked across
Niagara Falls on a 1,800-foot wire that was only 2 inches in diameter.
He took all the precautions he could. But adding to the drama and
danger of both the height and the rushing water below, a thick mist
obscured Nik’s sight, wind threatened his balance, and spray from the
falls challenged his footing. Amid—and perhaps because of—these
perils, he said that he “prayed a lot” and praised God.

The Israelites also praised God in the middle of a dangerous
challenge. Theirs involved a large group of warriors who had gathered
to fight them (2 Chron. 20:2). After humbly asking God for help, King
Jehoshaphat appointed a choir to march out into battle in front of the
Israelite army. The worshipers sang: “Praise the Lord, for His mercy
endures forever” (v.21). When they began to sing, the Lord caused the
enemy forces to attack and destroy each other.

Praising God in the midst of a challenge may mean overriding our
natural instincts. We tend toward self-protection, strategizing, and
worry. However, worshiping can guard our hearts against troubling
thoughts and self-reliance. It reminds us of the lesson the Israelites
learned: “The battle is not [ours], but God’s” (v.15).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I praise You, for Your mercy is everlasting. Help me to remember
that every battle in this life is Yours. The outcome belongs to You
because You are sovereign.

No matter what is in front of us, God is always behind us.
