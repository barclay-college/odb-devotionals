A New Force

My eyes have seen Your salvation which You have prepared before the
face of all peoples. —
Luke 2:30-31

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:25-35

When Matteo Ricci went to China in the 16th century, he took samples
of religious art to illustrate the Christian story for people who had
never heard it. They readily accepted portraits of Mary holding the
baby Jesus, but when he produced paintings of the crucifixion and
tried to explain that the God-child had come to be executed, his
audience reacted with revulsion and horror. They couldn’t worship a
crucified God.

As I thumb through my Christmas cards, I realize that we do much the
same thing. In our celebrations and observances, we may not think
about how the story that began at Bethlehem turned out at Calvary.

In Luke’s account of the Christmas story, only one person—the old man
Simeon—seems to grasp the mysterious nature of what God has set in
motion. “This Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in
Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against,” he told Mary,
and then he made the prediction that a sword would pierce her own soul
(2:34-35).

Simeon knew that though on the surface little had changed—Herod still
ruled, Roman troops still occupied Israel—underneath, everything had
changed. God’s promised redemption had arrived.
