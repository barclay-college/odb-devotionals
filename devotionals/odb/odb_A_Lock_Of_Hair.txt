A Lock Of Hair

The Lord . . . [shows] Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart
is loyal to Him. —
2 Chronicles 16:9

Today's Scripture: Judges 16:4-17

After his return from the moon, Neil Armstrong was often plagued by
the media. Seeking greater privacy, he moved his family into a small
town. But notoriety was a nuisance even there. Armstrong’s barber
found out that people would pay good money to get a lock of his hair.
So after giving the space hero several haircuts, he sold the clippings
to a buyer for $3,000! Armstrong was shocked at the barber’s
opportunism.

The Scriptures tell of another story of disloyalty and a haircut. As a
symbol of God’s calling of Samson as a Nazirite, he was never to cut
his hair (Judg. 13:5). When the Spirit of God came upon him, he was
given super-human strength over his enemies (15:14). Wanting to
overpower him, the Philistines hired Delilah, a woman who had a
relationship with him, to find out the secret of that strength. He
foolishly told her that his power would be gone if his hair were cut.
She lulled him to sleep and had him shorn (16:5,19).

Greed can drive us to be disloyal to others and to God, causing us to
make sinful choices. Our desire should be to exhibit a heart that is
fully committed to love the Lord and others. He shows “Himself strong
on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him” (2 Chron. 16:9).

Reflect & Pray

O Lord, may my heart be loyal to You In all that I say and all that I
do; When a trusted person is not a true friend, I know that on You I
can always depend. —Hess

Loyalty is the test of true love.
