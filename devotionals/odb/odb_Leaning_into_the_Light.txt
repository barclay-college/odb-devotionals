Leaning into the Light

[He] called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
1 Peter 2:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 2:4-10

One day I received a bouquet of pink tulips. Their heads bobbed on
thick stems as I settled them into a vase, which I placed at the
center of our kitchen table. The next day, I noticed that the flowers
were facing a different direction. The blossoms that once faced upward
were now leaning to the side, opening and reaching toward sunlight
that streamed in through a nearby window.

In one sense, we all were made to be like those flowers. God has
called us to turn to the light of His love. Peter writes of the wonder
of being called “out of darkness into [God’s] wonderful light”
(1 Peter 2:9). Before we come to know God, we live in the shadows of
sin and death, which keep us separated from Him (Eph. 2:1-7). However,
because of God’s mercy and love, He made a way for us to escape
spiritual darkness through the death and resurrection of His Son (Col.
1:13-14).

Jesus is the Light of the world, and everyone who trusts Him for the
forgiveness of sin will receive eternal life. Only as we turn to Him
will we increasingly reflect His goodness and truth (Eph. 5:8-9).

May we never forget to lean into the Light.

Reflect & Pray

Joyful, joyful we adore You, God of glory, Lord of love; hearts unfold
like flowers before You, opening to the sun above. Henry Van Dyke

Salvation from sin means moving from spiritual darkness to God’s
light.
