Spiritual Junk Food

Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. —
Hebrews 13:9

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 13:1-9

In many countries, childhood obesity is at an all-time high. A major
culprit in such unhealthy weight gain is poor eating habits and junk
food.

The term junk food refers to items that taste good but lack
nutritional value and are often very high in calories and fat. Chips,
soft drinks, candy bars, cookies, and many meals purchased at fast-
food restaurants fit these criteria.

To be spiritually healthy, we have to avoid “spiritual junk food” as
well. Some religious teachers proclaim “a different gospel” (Gal.
1:6), ranging from health-and-wealth to a counterfeit spirituality.
And some Christian music and books also contain false teaching. Taking
in this kind of “food” may seem to satisfy spiritual hunger, but it
will not lead to spiritual health.

Hebrews warns us: “Do not be carried about with various and strange
doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established by grace”
(Heb. 13:9). False teaching is detrimental to our health and is not
profitable, because it cannot cleanse from sin nor give power for
spiritual growth. But biblical content that is based upon grace and
truth does both.

Avoid “spiritual junk food” and instead feast on God’s Word to promote
your spiritual health.

Reflect & Pray

To walk close by Your side, my dear Savior, To be led by You, doing
each task, To feast richly on grace at Your table, And to know You is
all that I ask. —Somerville

Feeding on God’s truth will help us avoid swallowing lies.
