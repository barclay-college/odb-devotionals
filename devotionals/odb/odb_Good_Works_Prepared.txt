Good Works Prepared

For we are . . . created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God
prepared in advance for us to do.
Ephesians 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:6–10

When a burly stranger approached my wife and me on a street abroad, we
shrank back in fear. Our holiday had been going badly; we had been
yelled at, cheated, and extorted from several times. Were we going to
be shaken down again? To our surprise, the man just wanted to show us
where to get the best view of his city. Then he gave us a chocolate
bar, smiled, and left. That little gesture made our day—and saved the
whole trip. It made us grateful—both to the man and to God for
cheering us up.

What had made the man reach out to two strangers? Had he gone around
with a chocolate bar the entire day, looking to bless someone with it?

It’s amazing how the smallest action can bring the biggest smile—and
possibly direct someone to God. The Bible stresses the importance of
doing good works (James 2:17, 24). If that sounds challenging, we have
the assurance that God not only enables us to do these works, but has
even “prepared [them] in advance for us to do” (Ephesians 2:10).

Perhaps God has arranged for us to “bump into” someone who needs a
word of encouragement today or has given us an opportunity to offer
someone a helping hand. All we have to do is respond in obedience.

Reflect & Pray

Who can you pray for or help today? Who might God be putting in your
path?

Lord, may I respond in obedience and share Your love with others as
You have loved me.
