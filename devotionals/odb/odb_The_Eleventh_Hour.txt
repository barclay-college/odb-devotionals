The Eleventh Hour

Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war anymore. —
Isaiah 2:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 24:3-14

World War I has been ranked by many as one of the deadliest conflicts
in human history. Millions lost their lives in the first global modern
war. On November 11, 1918, a ceasefire was observed on the eleventh
hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. During that historic
moment, millions around the world observed moments of silence while
they reflected upon the war’s terrible cost—the loss of life and
suffering. It was hoped that “the Great War,” as it was called, would
truly be “the war that would end all wars.”

Despite the many deadly military conflicts that have followed, the
hope for lasting peace has not faded. And the Bible offers a hopeful
and realistic promise that someday wars will finally end. When Christ
returns, Isaiah’s prophecy will come true: “Nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore” (Isa.
2:4). Then the eleventh hour will pass and the first hour of lasting
peace in a new heaven and new earth will begin.

Until that day comes, those who follow Christ are to be people who
represent the Prince of Peace in the way we conduct our lives and in
the way we make a difference in our world.
