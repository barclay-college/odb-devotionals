No More Struggles

God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. —
Revelation 21:4

Today's Scripture: Revelation 21:1-4

Fay Weldon went through what she thought was a near-death experience
in 2006 when an allergic reaction stopped her heart. She retold her
experience to Elizabeth Grice of the London Daily Telegraph. She said
that a “terrible creature” tried to pull her through pearly gates,
while doctors tried to pull her back. Later, she said, “If that was
dying, I don’t want to do it again.” It’s “just more of the same. More
struggle.”

Often the process of dying is a struggle. But death itself need not be
feared by the believer in Christ—for it will bring us to heaven. In
Revelation, John gives a wonderful description of what eternity with
God will be like (21:1-4). He sees the New Jerusalem coming down out
of heaven. The city of Jerusalem was a physical sign of the people of
God and was described as the place where God dwells (Ps. 76:2). The
New Jerusalem, on the other hand, will not be made by human hands. It
will be a place where God lives with His people eternally, and it will
be a place of “no more”—no more pain, sorrow, and sickness.

We don’t know very much about eternity, but we do know that for the
Christian, whatever our emotional and physical struggles are now, they
will cease then. Life with God will be better by far.

Reflect & Pray

Think of a land of no sorrow, Think of a land of no fears, Think of no
death and no sickness, Think of a land of no tears. —Anon.

Heaven’s delights will far outweigh earth’s difficulties.
