Nothing Is Useless

Nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless.
1 Corinthians 15:58

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 15:42–58

In my third year battling discouragement and depression caused by
limited mobility and chronic pain, I confided to a friend, “My body’s
falling apart. I feel like I have nothing of value to offer God or
anyone else.”

Her hand rested on mine. “Would you say it doesn’t make a difference
when I greet you with a smile or listen to you? Would you tell me it’s
worthless when I pray for you or offer a kind word?”

I settled into my recliner. “Of course not.”

She frowned. “Then why are you telling yourself those lies? You do all
those things for me and for others.”

I thanked God for reminding me that nothing we do for Him is useless.

In 1 Corinthians 15, Paul assures us that our bodies may be weak now
but they will be “raised in power” (v. 43). Because God promises we’ll
be resurrected through Christ, we can trust Him to use every offering,
every small effort done for Him, to make a difference in His kingdom
(v. 58).

Even when we’re physically limited, a smile, a word of encouragement,
a prayer, or a display of faith during our trial can be used to
minister to the diverse and interdependent body of Christ. When we
serve the Lord, no job or act of love is too menial to matter.

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, thank You for valuing us and using us to build up others.

Do what you can with what you have and leave the results to God.
