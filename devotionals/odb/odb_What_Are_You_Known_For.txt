What Are You Known For?

Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier. —
Philippians 2:25

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:25-30

In the Roman Empire, pagans would often call on the name of a god or
goddess as they placed bets in a game of chance. A favorite deity of
the gambler was Aphrodite, the Greek word for Venus, the goddess of
love. During the roll of the dice, they would say “epaphroditus!”
literally, “by Aphrodite!”

In the book of Philippians we read of a Greek convert to the Christian
faith by the name of Epaphroditus. He was a close companion of Paul
who served him well in his missionary enterprise. Of his friend, Paul
wrote: “Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier”
(Phil. 2:25).

Epaphroditus was a spiritual brother in Christ, a faithful worker who
shared ministry efforts, a brave soldier of the faith, and the carrier
of the inspired letter to the church at Philippi. He modeled
brotherhood, a work ethic, spiritual endurance, and service.
Certainly, Epaphroditus had a well-deserved reputation that showed he
did not live by a pagan deity but by faith in Jesus Christ.

Even more important than our name are the Christian qualities that are
seen in our life: dependability, care, encouragement, and wisdom. What
words would you like others to use to describe you?
