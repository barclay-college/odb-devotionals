Making It Right

If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore
fourfold. —
Luke 19:8

Today's Scripture: Luke 19:1-10

It was a perfect day for our garage sale—bright and warm. People
rummaged through clothing, paperbacks, and mismatched dishes. I
noticed a young woman looking at a string of white beads. A few
minutes later, the necklace vanished along with its admirer. I spotted
her in the street, jogged the length of my driveway, and discovered
the missing jewelry nestled in her palm. As we faced each other with
the knowledge of what had happened, she volunteered to pay for the
stolen item.

Zacchaeus, the tree-climbing tax collector, met Jesus and was changed.
He vowed to repay four times the amount of money he had dishonestly
taken from others (Luke 19:8). In those days, tax collectors
frequently overcharged citizens and then pocketed the extra funds.
Zacchaeus’ eagerness to pay back the money and to donate half of what
he owned to the poor showed a significant change of heart. He had once
been a taker, but after meeting Jesus he was determined to make
restoration and be a giver.

Zacchaeus’ example can inspire us to make the same kind of change.
When God reminds us about items we have taken, taxes left unpaid, or
ways we have wronged others, we can honor Him by making it right.

Reflect & Pray

Help me, dear Lord, to be honest and true In all that I say and all
that I do; Give me the courage to do what is right To bring to the
world a glimpse of Your light. —Fasick

A debt is never too old for an honest person to pay.
