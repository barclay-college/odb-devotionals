More Than Waiting

A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and
you will see Me, because I go to the Father. —
John 16:16

Today's Scripture: Acts 1:1-11

I don’t know how it works where you live, but when I have to call for
a repair for one of my appliances, the company says something like,
“The repairman will be there between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.” Since I
don’t know when the repair person will arrive, all I can do is wait.

Jesus told His followers that He would soon be leaving them and they
would need to wait for His return in “a little while” (John 16:16).
After His resurrection, they saw Him again and they hoped He would be
establishing His kingdom on earth at that time. But He told them, “It
is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in
His own authority” (Acts 1:7). They would have to wait even longer.

But they were to do more than wait. Jesus told His followers that they
were to “be witnesses to [Him] in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (v.8). And He gave them the
Holy Spirit to empower them to do this.

We still wait for Jesus’ return. And while we do, it’s our delight, in
the Holy Spirit’s power, to tell and show others who He is, what He
has done for all of us through His death and resurrection, and that He
has promised to return.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, we love You so much. We want our words and our lives to be
a witness of Your goodness and grace. Please use us in ways we never
thought possible.

Wait and witness till Jesus returns.
