Abundant Supply

You give them drink from your river of delights.
Psalm 36:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 36:5-12

We have a hummingbird feeder in the garden, and we love to see the
little birds come and drink from its sugary water. Recently, however,
we went on a short trip and forgot to replenish its contents. When we
came back, it was completely dry. Poor birds! I thought. Because of my
forgetfulness, they haven’t had any nourishment. Then I was reminded
that I am not the one who feeds them: God is.

Sometimes we may feel that all of the demands of life have depleted
our strength and there is no one to replenish it. But others don’t
feed our souls: God does.

In Psalm 36 we read about God’s lovingkindness. It describes those who
put their trust in Him and are abundantly satisfied. God gives them
water from His “river of delights” (v. 8). He is the fountain of life!

We can go to God every day for the supply of our needs. As Charles
Spurgeon wrote, “The springs of my faith and all my graces; the
springs of my life and all my pleasures; the springs of my activity
and all its right doings; the springs of my hope, and all its heavenly
anticipations, all lie in thee, my Lord.”

Let us be filled with His abundant supply. His fountain will never run
dry.
