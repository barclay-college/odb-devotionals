It Will Be Worth It All

But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country. —
Hebrews 11:16

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 11:8-16

We wondered why a friend of ours kept traveling to Hobart, Tasmania.
Recently she invited us to join her there. From the airport we drove
over a bridge and through the city and suburbs. Nothing
outstanding—but we kept on traveling. After a few difficult hairpin
turns that took us slowly and sharply uphill, we saw the outline of
the coast below. Still quite ordinary looking.

But as we drove up the steep driveway and arrived at our destination,
the spectacular panorama of the city became clear. Even the bridge we
had driven over that seemed so drab looked beautiful! Now we knew why
she so often traveled there.

The lives of the pioneers of faith in Hebrews 11 had their share of
“hairpin turns” and “humdrum” situations. But they pressed on and did
not turn back. Their destination? Heaven, “the city which has
foundations, whose builder and maker is God” (v.10).

Esther Kerr Rusthoi wrote about our journey to heaven in her hymn
“When We See Christ”: It will be worth it all, when we see Jesus;
Life’s trials will seem so small when we see Christ; One glimpse of
His dear face, all sorrow will erase; So bravely run the race, till we
see Christ!

Today, whether life is ordinary or difficult, keep pressing on. At the
end of the journey, you will see the amazing place God has prepared
for us. And it will be well worth it!
