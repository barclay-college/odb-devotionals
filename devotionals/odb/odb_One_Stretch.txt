One Stretch

Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
should be called children of God! —
1 John 3:1

Today's Scripture: 1 John 2:24–3:3

For years, Sarah had low-back pain that continued to worsen. Her
doctor sent her for physical therapy, and she was given 25 stretches
to do every day. The pain lessened but not completely. So the doctor
ordered x-rays and sent her to another therapist, who instructed her
to discontinue the other therapist’s stretches and do only one stretch
a day as needed. Surprisingly, the one simple stretch worked the best.

Sometimes the simplest truths are the best. When asked to summarize in
one sentence his whole life’s work in theology, Karl Barth responded:
“Jesus loves me!” Some say he added, “This I know, for the Bible tells
me so.”

God’s love for us is evident. He gave His Son to rescue us from
ourselves. Christ died on the cross, taking our burden of sin. Then He
rose again, giving us new life in Him. Amazing love! As John tells us:
“Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
should be called children of God!” (1 John 3:1).

Jesus’ love for us isn’t a Band-Aid or a cure-all for all of life’s
problems, of course. But it is the one truth we can always depend on
to give purpose to life and peace with God.

Reflect & Pray

I am so glad that our Father in heaven Tells of His love in the Book
He has given; Wonderful things in the Bible I see— This is the
dearest, that Jesus loves me. —Bliss

The wonder of it all— just to think that Jesus loves me.
