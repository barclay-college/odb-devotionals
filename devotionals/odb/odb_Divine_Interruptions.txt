Divine Interruptions

Jesus asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” “Lord, I want to
see,” he replied.
Luke 18:40–41

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 18:35–43

Experts agree that a staggering amount of time is consumed each day by
interruptions. Whether at work or at home, a phone call or an
unexpected visit can easily deflect us from what we feel is our main
purpose.

Not many of us like disruptions in our daily lives, especially when
they cause inconvenience or a change of plans. But Jesus treated what
appeared to be interruptions in a far different way. Time after time
in the Gospels, we see the Lord stop what He is doing to help a person
in need.

While Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem where He would be crucified, a
blind man begging by the side of the road called out, “Jesus, Son of
David, have mercy on me!” (Luke 18:35–38). Some in the crowd told him
to be quiet, but he kept calling out to Jesus. Jesus stopped and asked
the man, “‘What do you want me to do for you?’ ‘Lord, I want to see,’
he replied. Jesus said to him, ‘Receive your sight; your faith has
healed you’ ” (vv. 41–42).

When our plans are interrupted by someone who genuinely needs help, we
can ask the Lord for wisdom in how to respond with compassion. What we
call an interruption may be a divine appointment the Lord has
scheduled for that day.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, fill us with Your wisdom and compassion that we may
respond as You did to people in need.

Interruptions can be opportunities to serve.
