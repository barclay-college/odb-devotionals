Two Tales Of One City

The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows
those who trust in Him. —
Nahum 1:7

Today's Scripture: Nahum 1

The book of Jonah has the makings of a great movie plot. It contains a
runaway prophet, a terrible storm at sea, the prophet swallowed by a
great fish, God sparing the prophet’s life, and the repentance of a
pagan city.

But Jonah’s sequel—the book of Nahum—might not be so popular. Nahum
ministered in Nineveh just as Jonah had, but about 100 years later.
This time, the Ninevites had no interest in repentance. Because of
this, Nahum condemns Nineveh and proclaims judgment on the people.

To unrepentant Nineveh, the prophet preached: “The Lord is slow to
anger and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked” (Nah.
1:3). But Nahum also had a message of mercy. To comfort the people of
Judah, he proclaimed: “The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of
trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him” (v.7).

We see in the stories of Jonah and Nahum that with every new
generation comes the necessity of an individual response to God. No
one’s spiritual life can be handed off to another; we must each choose
to serve the Lord from our own heart. God’s message is as fresh today
as it was hundreds of years ago: judgment for the unrepentant but
mercy for the repentant. How will you respond?

Your mercy, Lord, how great it is To overrule our sin! So help us know
Your righteousness And choose to walk therein. —D. De Haan

God’s judgment is certain, but so is His mercy.
