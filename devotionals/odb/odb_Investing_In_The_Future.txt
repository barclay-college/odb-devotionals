Investing In The Future

Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. —
Matthew 6:20

Today's Scripture: Matthew 6:19-24

Jason Bohn was a college student when he made a hole-in-one golf shot
that won him a million dollars. While others may have squandered that
money, Bohn had a plan. Wanting to be a pro golfer, he used the money
as a living-and-training fund to improve his golf skills. The cash
became an investment in his future—an investment that paid off when
Bohn won the PGA Tour’s 2005 B.C. Open. Bohn’s decision to invest in
the future instead of living for the moment was a wise one indeed.

In a sense, that is what Jesus calls us to do. We have been entrusted
with resources—time, ability, opportunity— and we decide how to use
them. Our challenge is to see those resources as an opportunity to
invest long-term. “Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,” is how
Jesus put it in Matthew 6:20. Those protected treasures cannot be
destroyed nor taken away, Jesus assures us.

Think of your resources: talent, time, knowledge. These are temporal
and limited. But if you invest them with an eye toward eternity, these
temporary things can have enduring impact. What is your focus? Now or
forever? Invest in the future. It will not only have an eternal
impact, but it will also change the way you view life each day.
