Minister of Loneliness

Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters.
Hebrews 13:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 13:1–8

Following her husband’s death, Betsy has spent most days in her flat,
watching television and boiling tea for one. She’s not alone in her
loneliness. More than nine million Brits (15 percent of the
population) say they often or always feel lonely, and Great Britain
has appointed a minister of loneliness to find out why and how to
help.

Some causes of loneliness are well known: We move too often to put
down roots. We believe we can take care of ourselves, and we don’t
have a reason to reach out. We’re separated by technology—each of us
immersed in our own flickering screens.

I feel the dark edge of loneliness, and you may too. This is one
reason we need fellow believers. Hebrews concludes its deep discussion
of Jesus’s sacrifice by encouraging us to meet together continually
(10:25). We belong to the family of God, so we’re to love “one another
as brothers and sisters” and “show hospitality to strangers” (13:1–2).
If we each made an effort, everyone would feel cared for.

Lonely people may not return our kindness, but this is no reason to
give up. Jesus has promised to never leave nor forsake us (13:5), and
we can use His friendship to fuel our love for others. Are you lonely?
What ways can you find to serve the family of God? The friends you
make in Jesus last forever, through this life and beyond.

Reflect & Pray

Who needs your friendship? How might you serve someone in your church
or neighborhood this week?

The family of God is intended to be the answer to loneliness.
