Feeling Forsaken

My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
Matthew 27:46

Today's Scripture: Psalm 22:1-21

In his book The Screwtape Letters, C. S. Lewis records an imaginary
conversation between a senior devil and a junior devil as they discuss
how to properly tempt a Christian. The two devils desired to destroy
the believer’s faith in God. “Be not deceived,” the senior devil says
to the junior. “Our cause is never more in jeopardy than when a human
. . . looks round upon a universe in which every trace of [God] seems
to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.”

The Bible gives us many examples of people who acted with faith
despite their feelings of abandonment. Abram felt that God’s promise
of an heir had gone unheeded (Gen. 15:2-3). The psalmist felt ignored
in his trouble (Ps. 10:1). Job’s troubles were so great that he
thought God might even kill him (Job 13:15). And Jesus from the cross
cried out: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matt. 27:46).
Yet in each instance God was shown to be faithful (Gen. 21:1-7; Ps.
10:16-18; Job 38:1–42:17; Matt. 28:9-20).

Although Satan may try to tempt you to think you are forsaken, God is
always near. He never forsakes His own. “God has said, ‘Never will I
leave you; never will I forsake you’ ” (Heb. 13:5). We may boldly say,
“The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid” (v. 6).

Lord, although clouds and darkness sometimes shroud me, I know that
You are close by my side. Thank You.

God is always near in spite of our fears.
