A Fresh Start

Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are
sick. —
Luke 5:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 5:17-26

In many countries, health laws prohibit reselling or reusing old
mattresses. Only landfills will take them. Tim Keenan tackled the
problem and today his business employs a dozen people to extract the
individual components of metal, fabric, and foam in old mattresses for
recycling. But that’s only part of the story. Journalist Bill Vogrin
wrote, “Of all the items Keenan recycles . . . it’s the people that
may be his biggest success” (The Gazette, Colorado Springs). Keenan
hires men from halfway houses and homeless shelters, giving them a job
and a second chance. He says, “We take guys nobody else wants.”

Luke 5:17-26 tells how Jesus healed the body and the soul of a
paralyzed man. Following that miraculous event, Levi answered Jesus’
call to follow Him and then invited his fellow tax collectors and
friends to a banquet in honor of the Lord (vv.27-29). When some people
accused Jesus of associating with undesirables (v.30), He reminded
them that healthy people don’t need a doctor—adding, “I have not come
to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance” (v.32).

To everyone who feels like a “throwaway” headed for the landfill of
life, Jesus opens His arms of love and offers a fresh beginning.
That’s why He came!
