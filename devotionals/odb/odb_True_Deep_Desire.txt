True, Deep Desire

“What do you want me to do for you?” Jesus asked him.
Mark 10:51

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 10:46–52

A mouse with a shrill voice, Reepicheep is perhaps The Chronicles of
Narnia’s most valiant character. He charged into battle swinging his
tiny sword. He rejected fear as he prodded on the Dawn Treader toward
the Island of Darkness. The secret to Reepicheep’s courage? He was
deeply connected to his longing to get to Aslan’s country. “That is my
heart’s desire,” he said. Reepicheep knew what he truly wanted, and
this led him toward his king.

Bartimaeus, a blind man from Jericho, sat in his normal spot jingling
his cup for coins when he heard Jesus and the crowd approaching. He
yelled out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” (Mark 10:47). The
crowd tried to silence him, but Bartimaeus couldn’t be stopped.

“Jesus stopped,” Mark says (v. 49). In the midst of the throng, Jesus
wanted to hear Bartimaeus. “What do you want?” Jesus asked (v. 51).

The answer seemed obvious; surely Jesus knew. But He seemed to believe
there was power in allowing Bartimaeus to express his deep desire. “I
want to see,” Bartimaeus said (v. 51). And Jesus sent Bartimaeus home
seeing colors, beauty, and the faces of friends for the first time.

Not all desires are met immediately (and desires must be transformed),
but what’s essential here is how Bartimaeus knew his desire and took
it to Jesus. If we’ll pay attention, we’ll notice that our true
desires and longings always lead us to Him.

Reflect & Pray

What do you truly desire? How might this desire lead you to Jesus?

Jesus, help me to bring my desires to You. What I’m ultimately seeking
can only be satisfied by what You alone can provide.
