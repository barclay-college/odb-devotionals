Jesus in Disguise

Whatever you did for one of the least of these . . . you did for me.
Matthew 25:40

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 25:31–40

When a friend cared for her housebound mother-in-law, she asked her
what she longed for the most. Her mother-in-law said, “For my feet to
be washed.” My friend admitted, “How I hated that job! Each time she
asked me to do it I was resentful, and would ask God to hide my
feelings from her.”

But one day her grumbling attitude changed in a flash. As she got out
the bowl and towel and knelt at her mother-in-law’s feet, she said, “I
looked up, and for a moment I felt like I was washing the feet of
Jesus Himself. She was Jesus in disguise!” After that, she felt
honored to wash her mother-in-law’s feet.

When I heard this moving account, I thought of Jesus’s story about the
end of time that He taught on the slopes of the Mount of Olives. The
King welcomes into His kingdom His sons and daughters, saying that
when they visited the sick or fed the hungry, “Whatever you did for
one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for
me” (Matt. 25:40). We too serve Jesus Himself when we visit those in
prison or give clothes to the needy.

Today, might you echo my friend, who now wonders when she meets
someone new, “Are you Jesus in disguise?”

Lord Jesus Christ, You can transform the most mundane of tasks. Help
me to love others in Your name.

When we serve others, we serve Jesus.
