Overcoming Bad News

Lord, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us. —
Psalm 4:6

Today's Scripture: Psalm 4

“There are many who say, ‘Who will show us any good?’” (Ps. 4:6).
These words of David seem to describe the pessimistic outlook we so
easily develop in our world today. The front page of newspapers and
the top stories on the Internet or television seem to focus on crime,
accidents, politics, the economy, and prominent people behaving badly.
Our conversations at work and home begin to dwell on difficulties, and
it’s enough to discourage anyone. Where can we turn for better news?

In the midst of his troubles, David turned to the Lord, who relieved
his distress (v.1) and heard his prayer (v.3). Instead of hoping for
temporary good from altered circumstances, he found unceasing
encouragement in God. “Lord, lift up the light of Your countenance
upon us” (v.6). The result was a gladness of heart that surpassed any
earthly prosperity or success (v.7).

Throughout David’s life, before and after he became king of Israel, he
was never without opposition. But at the end of the day, he could say,
“I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, O Lord, make
me dwell in safety” (v.8).

Pondering the truths in Psalm 4 about God’s care for us is a good way
to begin and end every day.

Reflect & Pray

In His care confiding I will sweetly sleep, For the Lord my Savior
Will in safety keep. —Psalter

God is a safe dwelling place in life’s storms.
