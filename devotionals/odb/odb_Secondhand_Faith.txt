Secondhand Faith

Another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord nor the
work which He had done for Israel. —
Judges 2:10

Today's Scripture: Judges 2:6-12

When I was growing up in Singapore, I remember that some of my school
friends were kicked out of their homes by their non-Christian parents
for daring to believe in Jesus Christ. They suffered for their beliefs
and emerged with stronger convictions. By contrast, I was born and
raised in a Christian family. Though I didn’t suffer persecution, I
too had to make my convictions my own.

The Israelites who first entered the Promised Land with Joshua saw the
mighty acts of God and believed (Judg. 2:7). But sadly, the very next
generation “did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for
Israel” (v.10). So it was not long before they turned aside to worship
other gods (v.12). They didn’t make their parents’ faith their own.

No generation can live off the faith of the previous generation. Every
generation needs a firsthand faith. When faced with trouble of any
kind, the faith that is not personalized is likely to drift and
falter.

Those who are second, third, or even fourth generation Christians have
a wonderful legacy, to be sure. However, there’s no secondhand faith!
Find out what God says in His Word and personalize it so that yours is
a fresh, firsthand faith (Josh. 1:8).

Reflect & Pray

O for a faith that will not shrink Though pressed by many a foe, That
will not tremble on the brink Of any earthly woe! —Bathurst

If your faith is not personalized, it’s not faith.
