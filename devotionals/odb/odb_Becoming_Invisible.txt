Becoming Invisible

There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under
the heavens.
Ecclesiastes 3:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 2:11-22

Where I live, this is the time of year when plants defy death by
remaining underground until it is safe to come out again. Before the
snow comes and the ground freezes, they let go of their beautiful
blooms and retreat to a place where they can rest and save energy for
the next growing season. Contrary to the way it looks, they are not
dead; they are dormant. When the snow melts and the ground thaws, they
will again lift their heads toward heaven, greeting their Creator with
brilliant colors and sweet fragrances.

The seasons of life require that we sometimes enter a period of
dormancy. We are not dead, but we may feel we’ve become invisible.
During such times we may feel useless, and we may wonder whether God
will ever use us again. But periods like this are for our protection
and preparation. When the time is right and the conditions are safe,
God will call us once again to service and worship.

Moses experienced a period of time like this. After killing an
Egyptian who harmed a fellow Hebrew, Moses had to flee for his life to
the distant land of the Midianites (Ex. 2:11-22). There, God protected
him and prepared him for the biggest assignment of his life (3:10).

So be encouraged. We are never invisible to God.

Savior, like a shepherd lead us, much we need Thy tender care; in Thy
