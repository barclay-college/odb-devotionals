The Lamb Who Is The Lion

At the name of Jesus every knee should bow . . . [and] every tongue
should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. —
Philippians 2:10-11

Today's Scripture: Revelation 5:1-12

In Revelation 5, the apostle John portrays Jesus, the Lion of Judah
(v.5), as a wounded Lamb (v.6). Referring to this word picture,
preacher Charles Spurgeon asked, “Why should our exalted Lord appear
in His wounds in glory?” His reply: “The wounds of Jesus are His
glory.”

Typically, the symbol of a lamb does not represent power and victory.
Most people prefer symbols of strength that invite admiration. Yet God
chose to be incarnated as a baby born into a poor carpenter’s home. He
lived as an itinerant preacher and died “as a lamb to the slaughter”
(Isa. 53:7) on a Roman cross. Everyone, including His disciples,
thought that His crucifixion spelled the end of the One who had dared
to defy the established religious order of His day. But when Jesus
Christ rose from the dead, He demonstrated mightily God’s incomparable
power and glory.

The day is coming when Jesus will return in glory to rule what is
rightfully His. On that day, all will bow before Him and say, “Worthy
is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and
strength and honor and glory and blessing!” (Rev. 5:12). Jesus, the
Lamb who is also the Lion, deserves our praise!

Every knee in heaven is bending To the Lamb for sinners slain; Every

To honor our King, His praises we sing.
