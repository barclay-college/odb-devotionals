The Hand Of God

My soul follows close behind You; Your right hand upholds me. —
Psalm 63:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 63:1-8

When NASA began using a new kind of space telescope to capture
different spectrums of light, researchers were surprised at one of the
photos. It shows what looks like fingers, a thumb, and an open palm
showered with spectacular colors of blue, purple, green, and gold.
Some have called it “The Hand of God.”

The idea of God reaching out His hand to help us in our time of need
is a central theme of Scripture. In Psalm 63 we read: “Because You
have been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings I will
rejoice. My soul follows close behind You; Your right hand upholds me”
(vv.7-8). The psalmist felt God’s divine help like a hand of support.
Some Bible teachers believe that King David wrote this psalm in the
wilderness of Judah during the terrible time of his son Absalom’s
rebellion. Absalom had conspired to dethrone his father, and David
fled to the wilderness (2 Sam. 15–16). Even during this difficult
time, God was present and David trusted in Him. He said, “Because Your
lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise You” (Ps.
63:3).

Life can be painful at times, yet God offers His comforting hand in
the midst of it. We are not beyond His reach.

Reflect & Pray

Beneath His watchful eye His saints securely dwell; That hand which
bears all nature up Shall guard His children well. —Doddridge

God bears the world’s weight on His shoulder, yet holds His children
in the palm of His hand.
