Repeat Warnings

I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in
the grace of Christ, to a different gospel. —
Galatians 1:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 1:6-10

“Caution, the moving walkway is ending. Caution, the moving walkway is
ending.” If you’ve ever used an automated walkway at an airport,
you’ve heard this kind of announcement repeatedly.

Why do airports repeat this announcement over and over? To ensure
safety and to protect them from liability if someone were to be
injured.

Repeated announcements can be annoying, but they do have value. As a
matter of fact, the apostle Paul thought repeating a warning was so
vital that he did it in the text of Galatians. But his statement had
value far beyond the danger of tripping at the airport. Paul warned
them not to listen to, nor believe, him or an angel from heaven if
they preached “any other gospel” than what they had already heard
(1:8). In the next verse, Paul said it again. It was a warning worth
repeating. The Galatians had begun to believe that their salvation was
dependent on good works instead of the true gospel: faith in Christ’s
work.

The gospel of Jesus—His death, burial, and resurrection for the
forgiveness of sins—is the story that we have the privilege and
responsibility to share. When we present the gospel, let’s share that
the risen Jesus is the only solution to the problem of sin.
