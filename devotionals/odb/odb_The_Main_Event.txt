The Main Event

One thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part. —nkjv
Luke 10:42

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 10:38-42

While watching a fireworks display during a celebration in my city, I
became distracted. Off to the right and the left of the main event,
smaller fireworks occasionally popped up in the sky. They were good,
but watching them caused me to miss parts of the more spectacular
display directly above me.

Sometimes good things take us away from something better. That
happened in the life of Martha, whose story is recorded in Luke
10:38-42. When Jesus and His disciples arrived in the village of
Bethany, Martha welcomed them into her home. Being a good host meant
that someone had to prepare the meal for the guests, so we don’t want
to be too hard on her.

When Martha complained that her sister Mary wasn’t helping, Jesus
defended Mary’s choice to sit at His feet. But the Lord wasn’t saying
that Mary was more spiritual than her sister. On occasion Martha seems
to have shown more trust in Jesus than Mary did (John 11:19-20). And
He wasn’t being critical of Martha’s desire to look after their
physical needs. Rather, what the Lord wanted Martha to hear is that in
the busyness of our service, listening to Him is the main event.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me to remember that my service for You is important,
but it can never take the place of intimate fellowship with You.

Jesus longs for our fellowship.
