Heaven’s Love Song

We love him because he first loved us.
1 John 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 5:1–13

In 1936, songwriter Billy Hill released a popular hit song titled “The
Glory of Love.” Before long a nation was singing about the joy of
doing even little things out of love for one another. Fifty years
later, lyricist Peter Cetera wrote a more romantic song with a similar
title. He imagined two people living forever, knowing together they
did it all—for the glory of love.

Revelation, the last book in the Bible, describes a new love song that
will someday lift the voices of everyone in heaven and earth
(Revelation 5:9, 13). The music begins, however, in a minor key of
mourning. John, our narrator, cries, seeing no answer to all that has
gone wrong with the world (vv. 3–4). But his mood brightens and the
music builds to a crescendo (vv. 12–13) as John learns the real glory
and story of love. Soon he hears all creation praising the powerful
Lion-King of Judah (v. 5), who has won the hearts of His subjects by
lovingly sacrificing Himself, like a Lamb, for our rescue (v. 13).

In the most moving lyrics ever sung, we see why even simple acts of
kindness rise on the wings of a song. The glory we sing about reflects
the heart of our God. We sing about Him because He gave us our song.

Reflect & Pray

Father, please help us to see that even the smallest acts of love and
kindness can remind us of Your love for us.

In what ways can you thank God today through simple acts of kindness?
