Ready for the Wedding

Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.
Matthew 25:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 25:1–13

“I’m hungry,” said my eight-year-old daughter. “I’m sorry,” I said, “I
don’t have anything for you. Let’s play tic-tac-toe.” We had been
waiting over an hour for the bride to arrive at the church for what
was supposed to be a noon wedding. As I wondered how much longer it
would be, I hoped I could occupy my daughter until the wedding
started.

As we waited, I felt like we were enacting a parable. Although the
vicarage where we live is a stone’s throw from the church, I knew if I
went to fetch some crackers, the bride could come at any moment and I
would miss her entrance. As I employed many distraction techniques
with my hungry daughter, I also thought about Jesus’s parable about
the ten virgins (Matt. 25:1–13). Five came prepared with enough oil
for their lamps to stay lit as they waited for the bridegroom, but
five did not. Just as it was too late for me to dash back to the
vicarage, so it was too late for the young women to go and buy more
oil for their lamps.

Jesus told this parable to emphasize that we need to be prepared, for
when He comes again we will give an account over the state of our
hearts. Are we waiting and ready?

Reflect & Pray

What does waiting for Jesus’s return look like in your life? Have you
left something undone that you could attend to today?

We need to be ready for Christ to come again.
