God’s Good Heart

Count it all joy when you fall into various trials.
James 1:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:1-11

Roger had been through a lot. He had open-heart surgery to repair a
leaky valve. Then, within just a couple of weeks, doctors had to
perform the surgery again because of complications. He had just begun
to heal with physical therapy when he had a biking accident and broke
his collarbone. Added to this, Roger also experienced the heartbreak
of losing his mother during this time. He became very discouraged.
When a friend asked him if he had seen God at work in any small ways,
he confessed that he really didn’t feel he had.

I appreciate Roger’s honesty. Feelings of discouragement or doubt are
part of my life too. In Romans, the apostle Paul says, “We can rejoice
. . . when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help
us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character,
and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation” (5:3-4
nlt). But that doesn’t mean we always feel the joy. We may just need
someone to sit down and listen to us pour out our hearts to them, and
to talk with God. Sometimes it takes looking back on the situation
before we see how our faith has grown during trials and doubts.

Knowing that God wants to use our difficulties to strengthen our faith
can help us to trust His good heart for us.

Reflect & Pray

In what ways has God used trials in your life? Are you learning to
trust Him more?

God may lead us into troubled waters to deepen our trust in Him.
