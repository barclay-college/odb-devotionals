The “Chewing” Years

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
will be filled.
Matthew 5:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 2:1–11

My wife recently gave me a Labrador retriever puppy we named Max. One
day when Max was spending time with me in my study, I was
concentrating at my desk and heard the sound of paper ripping behind
me. I turned to find a guilty-looking puppy with a book wide open and
a page dangling from his mouth.

Our veterinarian tells us that Max is going through his “chewing
years.” As puppies lose their milk teeth and permanent ones grow, they
soothe their gums by chewing almost anything. We have to watch Max
carefully to ensure he isn’t gnawing on something that could harm him,
and we point him to healthy alternatives.

Max’s urge to chew—and my responsibility to watch him—cause me to
think about what we “chew on” in our minds and hearts. Do we carefully
consider what we are feeding our eternal souls when we read or surf
the web or watch TV? The Bible encourages us, “Like newborn babies,
crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your
salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good” (1 Peter
2:2–3). We need to fill ourselves daily with God’s Word and truth if
we are to thrive as followers of Christ. Only then can we grow to
maturity in Him.

Reflect & Pray

Loving Lord, help me to hunger for You and Your Word and to stay away
from that which harms me. Fill me with Your goodness today.

When Christ returns, what will He find us craving?
