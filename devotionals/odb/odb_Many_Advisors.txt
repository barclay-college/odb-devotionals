Many Advisors

Without counsel, plans go awry, but in the multitude of counselors
they are established. —
Proverbs 15:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 15:16-23

The fifteenth-century theologian Thomas à Kempis said, “Who is so wise
as to have perfect knowledge of all things? Therefore, trust not too
much to your own opinion, but be ready also to hear the opinions of
others. Though your own opinion be good, yet if for the love of God
you forego it and follow that of another, you shall the more profit
thereby.” Thomas recognized the importance of seeking the opinions of
trusted advisors when making plans for life.

In order to determine God’s course for life, the wise person should
open up to several avenues of counsel, through which God will bring
His guiding wisdom. When a person seeks the wise counsel of others, he
shows his realization that he might be overlooking some important
factors in his decisions.

Solomon, the wisest man in Israel, wrote about how important it is to
have counsel from others: “Without counsel, plans go awry, but in the
multitude of counselors they are established” (Prov. 15:22).

The Lord is the Wonderful Counselor (Isa. 9:6), and He desires to
protect us through wise advisors. Seek them out and thank God for
them. Let them help you discover a clearer picture of His plan for
your life.
