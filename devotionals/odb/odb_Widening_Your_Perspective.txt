Widening Your Perspective

Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. —
Matthew 28:19

Today's Scripture: Matthew 28:16-20

A missionary and I were invited to lunch with David, a man in his late
seventies who generously supported the missionary’s ministry. David
was not able to visit the missionary’s country, but as he gave thanks
for the food, he prayed with complete ease for the people, places, and
situations there. Having prayed regularly for that ministry, he had no
trouble mentioning specifics. David had a perspective on missions that
extended beyond his own country of Singapore.

Our Lord Jesus commanded us to have a worldwide perspective on
missions. When He said, “Go therefore and make disciples of all the
nations, . . . teaching them to observe all things that I have
commanded you” (Matt. 28:19-20), He was not asking us to buy an
around-the-world ticket to do His bidding. We may not have the
opportunity to travel much beyond our own birthplace, but we can be
involved with what’s going on in the world without leaving our
hometown.

But how? Is there an international student living near you? A family
from another country who is trying to cope with life in a new country?
Or just a lonely person whom you can cheer up? Sharing Jesus’ love
with them is your way of crossing the oceans with the gospel.

Reflect & Pray

A Prayer: Lord, widen my world. I want to be a part of the work You
are doing. Give me eyes to see as You see, hands to serve others, and
a heart to share Your gospel. Amen.

If you look through the eyes of Jesus, you’ll see a needy world.
