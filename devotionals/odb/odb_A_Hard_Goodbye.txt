A Hard Goodbye

A father of the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in His holy
habitation. —
Psalm 68:5

Today's Scripture: Psalm 68:1-10

When our youngest son joined the Army, we knew that challenges lay
ahead. We knew that he would face danger and be tested physically,
emotionally, and spiritually. We also knew that in some ways our home
would never fully be his home again. In the months leading up to his
departure, my wife and I steeled ourselves for these challenges.

Then the day came when Mark had to report. We hugged and said our
goodbyes, and then he walked into the recruiting station, leaving me
with a moment for which I was decidedly unprepared. The pain of that
hard goodbye felt unbearable. At the risk of sounding overly dramatic,
I can’t remember when I have wept as hard as I did that day. The hard
goodbye, and the sense of loss it delivered, cut me to the heart.

In such moments, I am thankful to have a heavenly Father who knows
what it is to be separated from a beloved Son. I am thankful to have a
God who is described as “a father of the fatherless, a defender of
widows” (Ps. 68:5). I believe that if He cares for the orphaned and
the widows in their loneliness, He will also care for me and comfort
me—even in those moments when I face the struggles that accompany hard
goodbyes.

Reflect & Pray

When our loved ones say goodbye And we have to be apart, God can fill
our loneliness With His presence in our heart. —Sper

Loneliness comes when we forget about the One who is always with us.
