The Ultimate Satisfaction

Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no
money, come, buy and eat!
Isaiah 55:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 55:1–7

As we distributed snacks for children at a Bible School program, we
noticed a little boy who devoured his snack. Then he also ate the
leftovers of the children at his table. Even after I gave him a bag of
popcorn, he still wasn’t satisfied. As leaders, we were concerned as
to why this little boy was so hungry.

It occurred to me that we can be like that boy when it comes to our
emotions. We look for ways to satisfy our deepest longings, but we
never find what fully satisfies us.

The prophet Isaiah invites those who are hungry and thirsty to “come,
buy and eat” (Isaiah 55:1). But then he asks, “Why spend money on what
is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy?” (v. 2). Isaiah
is talking about more than just physical hunger here. God can satisfy
our spiritual and emotional hunger through the promise of His
presence. The “everlasting covenant” in verse 3 is a reminder of a
promise God made to David in 2 Samuel 7:8–16. Through David’s family
line, a Savior would come to reconnect people to God. Later, in John
6:35 and 7:37, Jesus extended the same invitation Isaiah gave, thus
identifying Himself as the Savior foretold by Isaiah and other
prophets.

Hungry? God invites you to come and be filled in His presence.

Reflect & Pray

Father, I long to know You more. Only You can satisfy my deepest
desires.

Only God will satisfy our spiritual hunger.
