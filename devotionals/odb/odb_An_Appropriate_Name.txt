An Appropriate Name

You shall call His name Jesus. —
Matthew 1:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 1:18-25

The name of the southeastern Asian nation of Indonesia is formed by
combining two Greek words which together mean “island.” That name is
appropriate because Indonesia is made up of more than 17,500 islands
spanning nearly 750,000 square miles. Indonesia—an appropriate name
for a nation of islands.

In the Bible, we find that people were often given names—sometimes at
birth, sometimes later—that made a statement about them or their
character. Barnabas, whose name means “son of encouragement,”
continually encouraged those he encountered. Jacob, whose name means
“schemer,” repeatedly manipulated people and situations for his own
selfish ends.

And no one has ever been more appropriately named than Jesus. When the
angel of the Lord spoke to Joseph about Mary’s soon-to-be-born Son, he
told Joseph, “You shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His
people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21).

Jesus means “the Lord saves” and defines both who Jesus is and why He
came. He was also called Immanuel, which means “God with us” (1:23).
His name reveals our eternal hope!
