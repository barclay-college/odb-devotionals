Chipmunk Chatter

Fear not; I will help you. —
Isaiah 41:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 41:10-13

I had laid out some landscape netting in my yard, upon which I was
going to spread decorative stones. As I was preparing to finish the
job, I noticed a chipmunk tangled up in the netting.

I put on my gloves and gingerly began clipping away at the netting.
The little guy was not happy with me. He kicked his hind feet and
tried to bite me. I calmly told him, “I’m not going to hurt you,
buddy. Just relax.” But he didn’t understand, so in fear he resisted.
I finally snipped the last restricting loop and sent him scampering
home.

Sometimes humans feel entangled and react in fear to the Lord. Through
the centuries, He has offered rescue and hope to people—yet we resist
Him, not understanding the help He provides. In Isaiah 41, the prophet
quotes the Lord as saying, “For I, the Lord your God, will hold your
right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not; I will help you’” (v.13).

As you think about your situation, how do you see God’s role? Are you
afraid to turn things over to Him—for fear that He might harm you? He
is good and He is near, wanting to free you from life’s entanglements.
You can trust Him with your life.

Reflect & Pray

In what area of your life do you need freedom? Ask the Lord to show
you and to give you the faith to trust Him for His deliverance.

Faith is the best antidote for fear.
