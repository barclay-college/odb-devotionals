Three-Word Obituary

Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the
right hand of God.
Romans 8:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:28-39

Before Stig Kernell died, he told the local funeral home that he
didn’t want a traditional obituary. Instead, the Swedish man
instructed them to publish only three words noting his passing: “I am
dead.” When Mr. Kernell died at age 92, that’s exactly what appeared.
The audacity and simplicity of his unusual death notice captured the
attention of newspapers around the world. In a strange twist, the
international curiosity about the man with the three-word obituary
caused more attention to his death than he intended.

When Jesus was crucified, the Lord’s obituary could have read, “He is
dead.” But after 3 days, it would have been changed to front-page news
saying, “He is risen!” Much of the New Testament is devoted to
proclaiming and explaining the results of Christ’s resurrection.
“Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at
the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall
separate us from the love of Christ? . . . We are more than conquerors
through him who loved us” (Rom. 8:34-37).

The three-word obituary of Jesus, “He is dead,” has been transformed
into an eternal anthem of praise to our Savior. He is risen! He is
risen indeed!

Jesus sacrificed His life for ours.
