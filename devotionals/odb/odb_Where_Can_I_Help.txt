Where Can I Help?

As we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who
are of the household of faith. —
Galatians 6:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 6:1-10

Last winter our city was hit by an ice storm. Hundreds of ice-heavy
tree limbs cut into power lines, leaving thousands of homes and
businesses without electrical power for days. Our family kept basic
energy coming into the house through a generator, but we were still
unable to cook meals. As we set out to find a place to eat, we drove
for miles past closed businesses. We finally found a breakfast
restaurant that had not lost power, but it was packed with hungry
customers who were in the same fix as we were.

When a woman came over to take our order for food, she said, “I’m not
really an employee of this restaurant. Our church group was having
breakfast here, and we saw how the staff was overwhelmed with so many
customers who came in. We told the restaurant management we would be
willing to help by waiting on tables if it would ease the burden and
help people to get fed.”

Her willingness to serve reminded me of Paul’s words: “As we have
opportunity, let us do good to all” (Gal. 6:10). In light of the many
needs around us, I wonder what could happen if we all asked God to
show us opportunities to serve Him and help others today.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, show us where and how we might serve others and ease their
burdens. Give us hearts of love and compassion that reflect Your love.
Then help us to take action.

We follow the example of Christ when we serve people in need.
