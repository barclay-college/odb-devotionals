When Words Fail

May your unfailing love be with us, Lord, even as we put our hope in
you.
Psalm 33:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:22–27

Not long ago I sent my wife, Cari, a text message using only voice
prompts. I was on my way out the door to give her a ride home from
work and intended to send the words, “Where would you like me to pick
you up, old gal?”

Cari doesn’t mind my calling her “old gal”—it’s one of the
affectionate nicknames we use around the house. But my cell phone
didn’t “understand” the phrase, and sent the words “old cow” instead.

Fortunately for me, Cari immediately understood what had happened and
found it funny. She later posted my text message on social media and
asked, “Should I be offended?” We were both able to laugh about it.

My wife’s loving response to my awkward words that day makes me think
about God’s loving understanding of our prayers. We may not know what
to say when we pray or even what to ask for, but when we belong to
Christ, His Spirit within “intercedes for us through wordless groans”
(Romans 8:26) and lovingly helps us articulate our deepest needs
before Him.

Our heavenly Father doesn’t stand at a distance waiting for us to get
our words right. We can come to Him with every need, assured that He
understands and receives us with love.

Reflect & Pray

Abba, Father, thank You that I can come to You without fear of having
to get my words just right. Help me to keep company with You today.

God’s love is beyond words.
