Live In Love

Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness; he is gracious,
and full of compassion. —
Psalm 112:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 112

In the African country where my friend Roxanne lives, water is a
precious commodity. People often have to travel long distances to
collect water from small, contaminated creeks—leading to sickness and
death. It’s difficult for organizations like orphanages and churches
to serve the people because of a lack of water. But that’s beginning
to change.

Through Roxanne’s leadership and the unselfish gifts of some loving
people in established churches, clean water wells are being dug. At
least six new wells are now operational, allowing churches to be
centers of hope and encouragement. A health center and a home for 700
orphans will also be able to be opened because of access to water.

That’s the kind of love that can flow from believers in Christ when we
have experienced the love and generosity of God. Paul says in 1
Corinthians 13 that if we don’t have love, our voices clang on
people’s ears and our faith means nothing. And the apostle John says
that if we have material possessions and see others in need and take
action, that’s evidence that God’s love is abiding in us (1 John
3:16).

God desires that we deal “graciously” (Ps. 112:5) with those in need,
for His heart is gracious toward us.

Reflect & Pray

Be not weary in your serving; Do your best for those in need;
Kindnesses will be rewarded By the Lord who prompts the deed. —Anon.

Kindness is Christianity with its working clothes on.
