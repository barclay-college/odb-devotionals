Tell It!

The man went away and began to tell . . . how much Jesus had done for
him.
Mark 5:20

Today's Scripture: Mark 5:1–20

The year was 1975 and something significant had just happened to me. I
needed to find my friend Francis, with whom I shared a lot of personal
matters, and tell him about it. I found him in his apartment hurriedly
preparing to go out, but I slowed him down. The way he stared at me,
he must have sensed that I had something important to tell him. “What
is it?” he asked. So I told him simply, “Yesterday I surrendered my
life to Jesus!”

Francis looked at me, sighed heavily, and said, “I’ve felt like doing
the same for a long time now.” He asked me to share what happened, and
I told him how the previous day someone had explained the gospel to me
and how I asked Jesus to come into my life. I still remember the tears
in his eyes as he too prayed to receive Jesus’s forgiveness. No longer
in a hurry, he and I talked and talked about our new relationship with
Christ.

After Jesus healed the man with an evil spirit, He told him, “Go home
to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you,
and how he has had mercy on you” (Mark 5:19). The man didn’t need to
preach a powerful sermon; he simply needed to share his story.

No matter what our conversion experience is, we can do what that man
did: “[He] went away and began to tell . . . how much Jesus had done
for him.”
