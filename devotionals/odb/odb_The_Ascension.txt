The Ascension

While they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of
their sight. —
Acts 1:9

Today's Scripture: Acts 1:1-11

When the husband of my longtime friend and publishing colleague
collapsed and later died, there was no doubt that life had slipped
away from him. There were witnesses. The same was true when Jesus
died. But three days later, Jesus was raised from the dead! We have no
doubt that this is true because there were witnesses who later saw Him
alive.

When we gathered for Dave’s memorial service, we read familiar
passages of Scripture that affirm our hope that he is now enjoying new
life in heaven. But we claimed these promises by faith because none of
us witnessed Dave go to heaven. There was, however, a witness who saw
Jesus in heaven. Not long after witnesses saw Jesus ascend (Acts 1:9),
Stephen saw the heavens open “and the Son of Man standing at the right
hand of God!” (7:56). One of the reasons we know that Jesus spoke the
truth about going to prepare a place for us (John 14:2) is that He has
been seen alive in heaven.

When a loved one goes ahead of us to heaven, we feel as if we’re being
pulled in the opposite direction—down into an abyss of sadness. Yet,
because God kept His promise to raise Christ and take Him to heaven,
we can trust Him to do the same for all who love and follow Him.

Reflect & Pray

The Lord has promised to prepare A place in heaven above— A home where
we will always be With Him and those we love. —Sper

The promise of heaven is our eternal hope.
