The Challenge Of Confinement

Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. —
2 Peter 3:18

Today's Scripture: Jeremiah 29:4-14

At the age of 86, Ken Deal concluded more than 3 decades of volunteer
jail and prison ministry with a final Sunday sermon. His message to
the inmates was about serving the Lord while incarcerated. Many of the
examples he used came from prisoners, some serving life sentences. In
a place everyone wants to leave, he encouraged them to grow and to
share the good news of Jesus Christ with others.

After the people of Judah were taken captive by King Nebuchadnezzar
and deported to Babylon because of their disobedience to God, the
prophet Jeremiah sent them this message from the Lord: “Build houses
and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit. Take wives and
beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons and give your
daughters to husbands . . . that you may be increased there, and not
diminished” (Jer. 29:5-6).

We may face some limiting circumstance today. Whether it is the result
of our failure, or through no fault of our own, we can “go” through it
or seek God’s strength to “grow” through it. The challenge of every
confinement is to increase rather than decrease; to grow and not
diminish. The Lord’s goal is to give us “a future and a hope” (v.11).

Reflect & Pray

I know, Lord, that You can use the circumstances I am in for my good.
Change me, and grow me in my knowledge of You and intimacy with You.
Give me Your strength.

A limited situation may afford the soul a chance to grow.
