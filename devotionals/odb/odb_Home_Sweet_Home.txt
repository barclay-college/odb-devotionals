Home Sweet Home

I am going there to prepare a place for you.
John 14:2

Today's Scripture: John 14:1–14

“Why do we have to leave our home and move?” my son asked. It’s
difficult to explain what a home is, especially to a five-year-old. We
were leaving a house, but not our home, in the sense that home is
where our loved ones are. It’s the place where we long to return after
a long trip or after a full day’s work.

When Jesus was in the upper room just hours before He died, He told
His disciples, “Do not let your hearts be troubled” (John 14:1). The
disciples were uncertain of their future because Jesus had predicted
His death. But Jesus reassured them of His presence and reminded them
they would see Him again. He told them, “My Father’s house has many
rooms . . . . I am going there to prepare a place for you” (v. 2). He
could have used other words to describe heaven. However, He chose
words that describe not an uncomfortable or unfamiliar place but a
place where Jesus, our loved One, would be.

C. S. Lewis wrote, “Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some
pleasant inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.” We
can thank God for the “pleasant inns” in life, but let’s remember that
our real home is in heaven where we “will be with the Lord forever” (1
Thessalonians 4:17).
