Help from the Outside

God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.
1 John 3:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 17:7-13

On a business trip, my husband had just settled into his hotel room
when he heard an unusual noise. He stepped into the hall to
investigate and heard someone yelling from a nearby room. With the
help of a hotel worker, he discovered that a man had become trapped in
the bathroom. The lock on the bathroom door had malfunctioned and the
man trapped inside started to panic. He felt like he couldn’t breathe
and began yelling for help.

Sometimes in life we feel trapped. We are banging on the door, pulling
on the handle, but we can’t get free. We need help from the outside,
just like the man in the hotel.

To get that outside assistance, we have to admit that we are helpless
on our own. Sometimes we look inward for the answers to our problems,
yet the Bible says “the heart is deceitful” (Jer. 17:9). In truth, we
are often the source of our problems in life.

Thankfully, “God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything”
(1 John 3:20). Because of this, He knows exactly how to help us.
Lasting heart-level change and real progress with our problems
originate with God. Trusting Him and living to please Him means we can
flourish and be truly free.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, I humble myself before You. I can’t solve my problems
on my own. Please help me to seek Your help and perspective.

God helps those who know they are helpless.
