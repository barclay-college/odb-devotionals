For Our Health

Oh, give thanks to the Lord! —
1 Chronicles 16:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Chronicles 16:7-14

According to a prominent Duke University Medical Center researcher,
“If thankfulness were a drug, it would be the world’s best-selling
product with [health benefits] for every major organ system.”

For some, being thankful means simply living with a sense of
gratitude—taking time to recognize and focus on the things we have,
instead of the things we wish we had. The Bible takes the idea of
thankfulness to a deeper level. The act of giving thanks causes us to
recognize the One who provides our blessings (James 1:17).

David knew that God was responsible for the safe delivery of the ark
of the covenant in Jerusalem (1 Chron. 15:26). As a result, he penned
a song of gratitude that centered on God instead of simply expressing
his delight in an important event. The ballad began: “Oh, give thanks
to the Lord! Call upon His name; make known His deeds among the
peoples!” (16:8). David’s song went on to rejoice in God’s greatness,
highlighting God’s salvation, creative power, and mercy (vv.25-36).

Today we can be truly thankful by worshiping the Giver instead of the
gifts we enjoy. Focusing on the good things in our lives may benefit
our bodies, but directing our thanks to God benefits our souls.

Reflect & Pray

Gratitude is our natural response to God’s grace. Nothing so takes the
heart out of a person as ingratitude. Gratitude is not only the
greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others. —Cicero

True thanksgiving emphasizes the Giver rather than the gifts.
