Human Chess

Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who
loves is born of God and knows God. —
1 John 4:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:7-12

Chess is an ancient game of strategy. Each player begins with 16
pieces on the chessboard with the goal of cornering his opponent’s
king. It has taken different forms over the years. One form is human
chess, which was introduced around ad 735 by Charles Martel, duke of
Austrasia. Martel would play the game on giant boards with real people
as the pieces. The human pieces were costumed to reflect their status
on the board and moved at the whim of the players—manipulating them to
their own ends.

Could this human version of the game of Chess be one that we sometimes
play? We can easily become so driven by our goals that people become
just one more pawn that we use to achieve them. The Scriptures,
however, call us to a different view of those around us. We are to see
people as created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26). They are objects of
God’s love (John 3:16) and deserving of ours as well.

The apostle John wrote, “Beloved, let us love one another, for love is
of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God” (1 John
4:7). Because God first loved us, we are to respond by loving Him and
the people He created in His image.

Reflect & Pray

Open my eyes, Lord, to people around me, Help me to see them as You do
above; Give me the wisdom and strength to take action, So others may
see the depth of Your love. —Kurt DeHaan

People are to be loved, not used.
