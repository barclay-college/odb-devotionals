Becoming A Mentor

The things that you have heard from me . . . , commit these to
faithful men who will be able to teach others also. —
2 Timothy 2:2

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 1:13-2:2

According to Homer’s Odyssey, when King Odysseus went off to fight in
the Trojan war, he left his son Telemachus in the hands of a wise old
man named Mentor. Mentor was charged with the task of teaching the
young man wisdom.

More than 2,000 years after Homer, a French scholar and theologian by
the name of François Fénelon adapted the story of Telemachus in a
novel titled Télémaque. In it he enlarged the character of Mentor. The
word mentor soon came to mean “a wise and responsible tutor”—an
experienced person who advises, guides, teaches, inspires, challenges,
corrects, and serves as a model.

Second Timothy 2:2 describes spiritual mentoring, and the Bible gives
us many examples. Timothy had Paul; Mark had Barnabas; Joshua had
Moses; Elisha had Elijah.

But what about today? Who will love and work with new Christians and
help them grow spiritually strong? Who will encourage, guide, and
model the truth for them? Who will call young believers to
accountability and work with God to help mold their character?

Will you become one whom God can use to impart wisdom and to help
others grow toward maturity?

Reflect & Pray

THINKING IT OVER Who has helped you to grow in your faith? How did
that person help you? By teaching, example, or friendship? To whom can
you be a mentor?

God teaches us so that we can teach others.
