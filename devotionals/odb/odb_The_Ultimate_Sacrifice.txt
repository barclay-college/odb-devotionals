The Ultimate Sacrifice

By this we know love, because [Jesus] laid down His life for us. —
1 John 3:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 3:16-23

When Deng Jinjie saw people struggling in the water of the Sunshui
River in the Hunan province of China, he didn’t just walk by. In an
act of heroism, he jumped into the water and helped save four members
of a family. Unfortunately, the family left the area while he was
still in the water. Sadly, Jinjie, exhausted from his rescue efforts,
was overwhelmed and swept away by the river current and drowned.

When we were drowning in our sin, Jesus Christ gave His life to come
to our aid. We were the ones He came to rescue. He came down from
heaven above and pulled us to safety. He did this by taking the
punishment for all of our wrongdoing as He died on the cross (1 Peter
2:24) and 3 days later was resurrected. The Bible says, “By this we
know love, because [Jesus] laid down His life for us” (1 John 3:16).
Jesus’ sacrificial love for us now inspires us to show genuine love
“in deed and in truth” (v.18) to others with whom we have
relationships.

If we overlook Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice on our behalf, we’ll fail to
see and experience His love. Today, consider the connection between
His sacrifice and His love for you. He has come for your rescue.
