Making Up For Lost Time

I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten. —
Joel 2:25

Today's Scripture: Joel 2:21-27

None of us can say that we have no regrets. Often we are led down
paths of bad choices—some paths longer than others—which can have a
lingering effect on the mind, body, and soul.

A friend of mine spent a number of years living a life of alcohol and
drug abuse. But God did an amazing work in his life, and he recently
celebrated 25 years of being free from substance abuse. He now runs a
successful business, has a devoted wife, and his children love Jesus.
He has a passion to reach out to others who are in the ditch of life,
and he serves as a wise and loving mentor in the rescue operations of
their lives.

God never gives up on us! Even if we’ve made poor choices in the past
that have left us with regret, we can choose how we will live now. We
can choose to continue destructive living, simply wallow in regret, or
we can run to Christ believing that He has ways to “restore . . . the
years that the swarming locust has eaten” (Joel 2:25). When we
repentantly seek His healing and freeing power, He is merciful.

While some consequences from the past may remain, we can be confident
that God has a good and glorious future for those who trust in Him!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, it is with humble and grateful hearts that we come to You and
lay all that we have been in the past at Your feet. Take us as we are
and make something beautiful out of our lives that brings glory to
You!

God never gives up on making something beautiful out of our lives.
