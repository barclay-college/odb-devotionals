Sweet Words

Put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering. —
Colossians 3:12

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 16:19-24

Scott had always admired the relationship between Ken and Phyllis, his
wife’s parents. So he asked them one day what made their marriage
work. Ken replied, “You need to keep it sweet!”

A friend of mine concludes many of her notes to me and my husband and
other friends with these words: “Remember to be good to each other.”

That’s great advice from both of them about being kind. The daily
stresses of life can easily cause us to get irritable with our spouses
or with others. We pick at the little annoyances or criticize minor
habits. We blurt out harmful, unkind words without thinking.

The book of Proverbs gives us counsel about the words we use with
others. It says, “Whoever guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul
from troubles” (21:23). And there are these warnings: “Death and life
are in the power of the tongue” (18:21); and “Reckless words pierce
like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing” (12:18 niv).
Ken’s advice about “keeping it sweet” reminds me of Proverbs 16:24,
“Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health
to the bones.”

Lord, fill our hearts with words that will be a blessing to others
today.

Reflect & Pray

Instead of hurling angry words That wound and stir up strife, Use
words of kindness, filled with love, That heal and nourish life. —Sper

Kind hearts are the gardens; kind thoughts are the roots; kind words
are the flowers; kind deeds are the fruits.
