The Mercy Of God

Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; my eye wastes away with
grief, yes, my soul and my body! —
Psalm 31:9

Today's Scripture: Psalm 31:9-15

Today marks the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the US on
September 11, 2001. It’s hard to think about that date without mental
images of the destruction, grief, and loss that swept over America and
the world following those tragic events. The loss of thousands of
lives was compounded by the depth of loss felt corporately—a lost
sense of security as a country. The sorrow of loss, personal and
corporate, will always accompany the memory of the events of that day.

Those horrific events are not the only painful memories of September
11. It also marks the anniversary of my father-in-law’s death. Jim’s
loss is felt deeply within our family and his circle of friends.

No matter what kind of sorrow we experience, there is only one real
comfort—the mercy of God. David, in his own heartache, cried to his
heavenly Father, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; my
eye wastes away with grief, yes, my soul and my body!” (Ps. 31:9).
Only in the mercy of God can we find comfort for our pain and peace
for our troubled hearts.

In all losses, we can turn to the true Shepherd, Jesus Christ, who
alone can heal our brokenness and grief.

Reflect & Pray

We have a Friend who’ll never leave, Who’s closer than a brother; He’s
there to meet our deepest needs, To comfort like no other. —Sper

When God permits suffering, He also provides comfort.
