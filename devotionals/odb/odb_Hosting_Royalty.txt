Hosting Royalty

So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith.
Galatians 3:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 3:26–29

After meeting the Queen of the United Kingdom at a ball in Scotland,
Sylvia and her husband received a message that the royal family would
like to visit them for tea. Sylvia started cleaning and prepping,
nervous about hosting the royal guests. Before they were due to
arrive, she went outside to pick some flowers for the table, her heart
racing. Then she sensed God reminding her that He’s the King of kings
and that He’s with her every day. Immediately she felt peaceful and
thought, “After all, it’s only the Queen!”

Sylvia is right. As the apostle Paul noted, God is the “King of kings
and Lord of lords” (1 Timothy 6:15) and those who follow Him are
“children of God” (Galatians 3:26). When we belong to Christ, we’re
heirs of Abraham (v. 29). We no longer are bound by division—such as
that of race, social class, or gender—for we’re “all one in Christ
Jesus” (v. 28). We’re children of the King.

Although Sylvia and her husband had a marvelous meal with the Queen, I
don’t anticipate receiving an invitation from the monarch anytime
soon. But I love the reminder that the highest King of all is with me
every moment. And that those who believe in Jesus wholeheartedly (v.
27) can live in unity, knowing they’re God’s children.

How could holding onto this truth shape the way we live today?

Reflect & Pray

What does it mean to you to be an heir of Abraham? How could you
invite others to become part of the family?

King of kings and Lord of lords, You are mighty and glorious. Thank
You for stooping down to love me and for welcoming me as Your child.
