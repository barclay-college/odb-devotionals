Unused Gears

Be ready for every good work. —
Titus 3:1

Today's Scripture: Titus 3:1-8

My first bike had one gear. Whether I was going fast or slow, uphill
or downhill, that gear did everything. My next bike had three gears:
one for level surfaces, one for going uphill, and one for going
downhill. My third bike had ten gears, allowing me an even broader
range of choices. Even though my last bike had several gears to choose
from, I didn’t use all of them every time I rode. Some were best
suited for starting and climbing, others were reserved for gaining
speed, and others were best for a leisurely pace. But the thing about
gears is this: Even though I wasn’t using all of them at the time, it
didn’t mean I would never need them.

The same can be true in regard to our spiritual gifts and abilities.
During times when I feel I am not being used to do certain things I
once did, instead of feeling useless and unappreciated I thank God for
the “gear” I’m currently able to use. Just because a skill is not
needed right now doesn’t mean it never will be.

Our spiritual gifts are needed in different ways at different times.
Needs and circumstances change in unforeseeable and unpredictable
ways. The apostle Paul reminded Titus, “Be ready for every good work”
(Titus 3:1). May that be true of us as well.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, I need to remember that what I do is up to You, but
how I do it is up to me. Whether I am busy or still, may I be
peaceable, gentle, humble, kind, and loving.

Keep your tools ready—God will find work for you.
