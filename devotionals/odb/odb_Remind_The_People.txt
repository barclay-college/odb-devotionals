Remind The People

Remind the believers to . . . show true humility to everyone. —
Titus 3:1–2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Titus 3:1-8

In a typical week, many of us receive a number of emails reminding us
of appointments or upcoming events or requests to pray for someone.
All of them are needed reminders.

When Paul wrote his “papyrus mail” to Titus, he ended his note by
saying, “Remind the believers . . .” (3:1 nlt). We can assume from
Paul’s word choice that he had already written about these things. But
they were of such importance to the people in the church that he
repeated them so they wouldn’t forget.

Notice what Paul didn’t want them to miss. He reminded the people—
living under the oppressive Roman rule—“to be subject to rulers and
authorities” (v.1). It was important to be known for obedience; for
doing what is good; for not slandering; for being peaceful and
considerate; and for humility rather than for complaining. Their
behavior was to showcase the change made in their lives by following
Christ (vv.3-5).

How could they—and we—do that? “The Holy Spirit whom He poured out on
us . . . through Jesus Christ” enables us to “devote [ourselves] to
doing what is good” (vv.5-6,8 niv). It is through Jesus’ great gift of
salvation that we are equipped to influence our world for good. That’s
a reminder we all need.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, remind us how important it is that we obey You and treat others
the way we want to be treated. Remind us that Your salvation enables
us to live as lights in a dark world.

A Christian’s life is a window through which others can see Jesus.
