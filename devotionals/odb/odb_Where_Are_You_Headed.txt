Where Are You Headed?

Where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord.
Psalm 121:1–2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 121

What determines our direction in life? I once heard an answer to that
question in a surprising place: a motorcycle training course. Some
friends and I wanted to ride, so we took a class to learn how. Part of
our training dealt with something called target fixation.

“Eventually,” our instructor said, “you’re going to face an unexpected
obstacle. If you stare at it—if you target fixate—you’ll steer right
into it. But if you look above and past it to where you need to go,
you can usually avoid it.” Then he added, “Where you’re looking is the
direction you’re going to go.”

That simple-but-profound principle applies to our spiritual lives too.
When we “target fixate”—focusing on our problems or struggles—we
almost automatically orient our lives around them.

However, Scripture encourages us to look past our problems to the One
who can help us with them. In Psalm 121:1, we read, “I lift up my eyes
to the mountains—where does my help come from?” The psalm then
answers: “My help comes from the Lord , the Maker of heaven and earth.
. . . The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and
forevermore” (vv. 2, 8).

Sometimes our obstacles can seem insurmountable. But God invites us to
look to Him to help us see beyond our troubles instead of letting them
dominate our perspective.

Reflect & Pray

Father, help me not to “target fixate,” but to look to You whenever I
face fearful obstacles as I seek to follow You along life’s road.

Our help is in the name of the Lord , the Maker of heaven and earth.
Psalm 124:8
