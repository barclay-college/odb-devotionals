The Via Dolorosa

We have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus
Christ once for all.
Hebrews 10:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 10:1–10

During Holy Week, we remember the final days before Jesus’s
crucifixion. The road Jesus traveled to the cross through the streets
of Jerusalem is known today as the Via Dolorosa, the way of sorrows.

But the writer of Hebrews viewed the path Jesus took as more than just
a path of sorrows. The way of suffering that Jesus willingly walked to
Golgotha made a “new and living way” into the presence of God for us
(Hebrews 10:20).

For centuries the Jewish people had sought to come into God’s presence
through animal sacrifices and by seeking to keep the law. But the law
was “only a shadow of the good things that are coming,” for “it is
impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins” (vv. 1,
4).

Jesus’s journey down the Via Dolorosa led to His death and
resurrection. Because of His sacrifice, we can be made holy when we
trust in Him for the forgiveness of our sins. Even though we aren’t
able to keep the law perfectly, we can draw near to God without fear,
fully confident that we are welcomed and loved (vv. 10, 22).

Christ’s way of sorrow opened for us a new and living way to God.

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, thank You for walking the way of sorrow and making a way for us
to be reconciled to God.

Christ’s sacrifice was what God desired and what our sin required.
