The Power of Demonstration

All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
correcting and training in righteousness.
2 Timothy 3:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Timothy 3:10–17

My attempts at fixing things around the house usually lead to paying
someone else to undo the damage I caused while trying to fix the
original problem. But recently I successfully repaired a home
appliance by watching a YouTube video where a person demonstrated step
by step how to do it.

Paul was a powerful example to his young protégé Timothy who traveled
with him and watched him in action. From prison in Rome, Paul wrote,
“You . . . know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose,
faith, patience, love, endurance, persecutions, sufferings” (2 Timothy
3:10–11). In addition, he urged Timothy to “continue in what you have
learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom
you learned it, and how from infancy you have known the Holy
Scriptures” (vv. 14–15).

Paul’s life demonstrated the necessity of building our lives on the
bedrock of God’s Word. He reminded Timothy that the Bible is the
powerful, God-given source that we need to teach and to demonstrate to
others who want to be Christ-followers.

As we thank the Lord for the people who helped us grow in faith, we
are challenged to follow their example of living out the truth as we
teach and encourage others.

That’s the power of demonstration.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, as others have demonstrated Your truth to us, may we in turn
show it to others.

We are called to live out God’s Word as we teach and encourage others.
