Sunshine Chaser

I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure. —
Ecclesiastes 2:10

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 2:1-11

Diana and Dave love to ride their jet skis on the lake, skimming
across the water on warm sunny days. But one morning the weather was
cool and mostly cloudy, and Diana couldn’t convince Dave to go out. So
she went on her own. It was so cold that she flitted back and forth
across the lake, trying to keep herself in the sunshine for some
needed warmth. But every time she reached a sunny area, the clouds
moved and it quickly turned to shade. Realizing the futility and
silliness of chasing the sunshine, she finally gave up because it
didn’t bring her what she wanted.

King Solomon did another kind of chasing that couldn’t bring him
satisfaction (Eccl. 2:1). In the first 11 verses of Ecclesiastes 2
alone, he mentions that he chased after pleasure, laughter, wine,
wisdom, houses, gardens, money, possessions, and music. But his
evaluation was that “all was vanity and grasping for the wind. There
was no profit under the sun” (2:11). Those pursuits were empty—“vanity
of vanities” (1:2). He wisely concluded: “Fear God and keep His
commandments, for this is man’s all” (12:13).

Are you chasing after some of the same things that Solomon was? It’s a
vain pursuit. Purpose and satisfaction come only from knowing and
obeying God.

Reflect & Pray

Chasing after empty pleasure Will not satisfy one’s heart; But to
those who follow Jesus, Life’s fulfillment He’ll impart. —Sper

Only God can fill an empty heart.
