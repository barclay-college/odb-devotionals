The King’s Crown

They . . . twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head.
Matthew 27:28–29

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 27:27–31

We sat around the table, each person adding a toothpick to the foam
disc before us. At our evening meal in the weeks leading up to Easter,
we created a crown of thorns—with each toothpick signifying something
we had done that day for which we were sorry and for which Christ had
paid the penalty. The exercise brought home to us, night after night,
how through our wrongdoing we were guilty and how we needed a Savior.
And how Jesus freed us through His death on the cross.

The crown of thorns that Jesus was made to wear was part of a cruel
game the Roman soldiers played before He was crucified. They also
dressed Him in a royal robe and gave Him a staff as a king’s scepter,
which they then used to beat Him. They mocked Him, calling Him “king
of the Jews” (Matthew 27:29), not realizing that their actions would
be remembered thousands of years later. This was no ordinary king. He
was the King of Kings whose death, followed by His resurrection, gives
us eternal life.

On Easter morning, we celebrated the gift of forgiveness and new life
by replacing the toothpicks with flowers. What joy we felt, knowing
that God had erased our sins and given us freedom and life forever in
Him!

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus Christ, my heart hurts to think of all of the pain and
suffering You endured for me. Thank You for Your gift of love that
sets me free.

The crown of thorns has become a crown of life.
