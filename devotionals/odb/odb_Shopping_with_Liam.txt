Shopping with Liam

He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel. —
Genesis 3:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 3:14-19

My son Liam loves to pick dandelions for his mother. To date, she
hasn’t wearied of receiving them. One man’s weed is a little boy’s
flower.

One day I took Liam shopping with me. As we hurried past the floral
section, he pointed excitedly to an arrangement of yellow tulips.
“Daddy,” he exclaimed, “you should get those dandelions for Mommy!”
His advice made me laugh. It made a pretty good Facebook post on his
mother’s page too. (By the way, I bought the tulips.)

Some see in weeds a reminder of Adam’s sin. By eating the forbidden
fruit, Adam and Eve brought on themselves the curse of a fallen
world—relentless work, agonizing birth, and eventual death (Gen.
3:16-19).

But Liam’s youthful eyes remind me of something else. There is beauty
even in weeds. The anguish of childbirth holds hope for us all. Death
is ultimately defeated. The “Seed” God spoke of in Genesis 3:15 would
wage war with the serpent’s offspring. That Seed is Jesus Himself, who
rescued us from the curse of death (Gal. 3:16).

The world may be broken, but wonder awaits us at every turn. Even
weeds remind us of the promise of redemption and a Creator who loves
us.

Reflect & Pray

Help us, Father, to find You even in the midst of all life’s pain and
aggravations. Forgive us for so often overlooking the beauty You have
planted everywhere.

Creation reminds us of the promise of redemption.
