Bread!

I am the bread of life.
John 6:48

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 6:34–51

I live in a small Mexican city where every morning and evening you can
hear a distinctive cry: “Bread!” A man with a huge basket on his bike
offers a great variety of fresh sweet and salty breads for sale. I
used to live in a bigger city, where I had to go to the bakery to buy
bread. So I enjoy having fresh bread brought to my door.

Moving from the thought of feeding physical hunger to spiritual
hunger, I think of Jesus’s words: “I am the living bread that came
down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever” (John
6:51).

Someone has said that evangelism is really one beggar telling another
beggar where he found bread. Many of us can say, “Once I was
spiritually hungry, spiritually starving because of my sins. Then I
heard the good news. Someone told me where to find bread: in Jesus.
And my life changed!”

Now we have the privilege and the responsibility of pointing others to
this Bread of Life. We can share Jesus in our neighborhood, in our
workplace, in our school, in our places of recreation. We can talk
about Jesus in the waiting room, on the bus, or on the train. We can
take the good news to others through doors of friendship.

Jesus is the Bread of Life. Let’s tell everybody the great news.
