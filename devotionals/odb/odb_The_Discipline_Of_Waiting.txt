The Discipline Of Waiting

I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined to me, and heard my
cry. —
Psalm 40:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 40:1-3

Waiting is hard. We wait in grocery lines, in traffic, in the doctor’s
office. We twiddle our thumbs, stifle our yawns, and fret inwardly in
frustration. On another level, we wait for a letter that doesn’t come,
for a prodigal child to return, or for a spouse to change. We wait for
a child we can hold in our arms. We wait for our heart’s desire.

In Psalm 40, David says, “I waited patiently for the Lord.” The
original language here suggests that David “waited and waited and
waited” for God to answer his prayer. Yet as he looks back at this
time of delay, he praises God. As a result, David says, God “put a new
song . . . a hymn of praise” in his heart (40:3 niv).

“What a chapter can be written of God’s delays!” said F. B. Meyer. “It
is the mystery of educating human spirits to the finest temper of
which they are capable.” Through the discipline of waiting, we can
develop the quieter virtues—submission, humility, patience, joyful
endurance, persistence in well-doing—virtues that take the longest to
learn.

What do we do when God seems to withhold our heart’s desire? He is
able to help us to love and trust Him enough to accept the delay with
joy and to see it as an opportunity to develop these virtues—and to
praise Him.

Reflect & Pray

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! Thou art the Potter, I
am the clay; Mold me and make me after Thy will, While I am waiting,
yielded and still. —Pollard

Waiting for God is never a waste of time.
