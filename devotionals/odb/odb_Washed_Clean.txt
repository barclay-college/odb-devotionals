Washed Clean

The blood of Jesus, [God’s] Son, purifies us from all sin.
1 John 1:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 2:13, 20–22

I couldn’t believe it. A blue gel pen had hidden itself in the folds
of my white towels and survived the washing machine, only to explode
in the dryer. Ugly blue stains were everywhere. My white towels were
ruined. No amount of bleach would be able to remove the dark stains.

As I reluctantly consigned the towels to the rag pile, I was reminded
of the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah’s lament describing the damaging
effects of sin. By rejecting God and turning to idols (Jeremiah 2:13),
Jeremiah declared that the people of Israel had caused a permanent
stain in their relationship with God: “‘Although you wash yourself
with soap and use an abundance of cleansing powder, the stain of your
guilt is still before me,’ declares the Sovereign Lord ” (v. 22). They
were powerless to undo the damage they’d done.

On our own, it is impossible to remove the stain of our sin. But Jesus
has done what we could not. Through the power of His death and
resurrection, He “purifies [believers] from all sin” (1 John 1:7).

Even when it’s hard to believe, cling to this beautiful truth: there’s
no damage from sin that Jesus can’t totally remove. God is willing and
ready to wash away the effects of sin for anyone willing to return to
Him (v. 9). Through Christ, we can live each day in freedom and hope.

Reflect & Pray

Where do you go with your guilt? How might you live differently today
knowing that Jesus’s death has the power to completely remove the
guilt and “stain” of your sin?

Jesus’s blood washes away sin’s stain.
