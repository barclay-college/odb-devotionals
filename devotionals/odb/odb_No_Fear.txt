No Fear

The angel said to them, “Do not be afraid.”
Luke 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:8–20

Nearly every time an angel appears in the Bible, the first words he
says are, “Do not be afraid” (Dan. 10:12, 19; Matt. 28:5; Rev. 1:17).
Little wonder. When the supernatural makes contact with planet Earth,
it usually leaves the human observers flat on their faces in catatonic
fear. But Luke tells of God making an appearance on earth in a form
that does not frighten. In Jesus, born in a barn and laid in a feeding
trough, God finds at last a mode of approach that we need not fear.
What could be less scary than a newborn baby?

Puzzled skeptics stalked Jesus throughout His ministry. How could a
baby in Bethlehem, a carpenter’s son, be the Messiah from God? But a
group of shepherds in a field had no doubt about who He was, for they
heard the message of good news straight from a choir of angels
(2:8–14).

Why did God take on human form? The Bible gives many reasons, some
densely theological and some quite practical; but the scene of Jesus
as an adolescent lecturing rabbis in the temple gives one clue (v.
46). For the first time, ordinary people could hold a conversation, a
debate, with God in visible form. Jesus could talk to anyone—His
parents, a rabbi, a poor widow—without first having to announce,
“Don’t be afraid.”

In Jesus, God comes close to us.
