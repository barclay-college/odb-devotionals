Giving Up?

I alone am left; and they seek to take my life. —
1 Kings 19:10

Today's Scripture: 1 Kings 19:11-18

Have you ever felt like giving up? Elijah did. The Lord had just used
him to show the nation of Israel that the Lord is God (1 Kings 18).
Yet, the threats of Queen Jezebel so alarmed him that he ran to
Beersheba, 100 miles south (19:3). Then he walked another 150 miles
south to Horeb, the mountain of God.

Twice God asked Elijah what he was doing there (vv.9,13). Both times
he answered with identical words—“I alone am left; and they seek to
take my life” (vv.10,14). He had become so preoccupied with his own
fears that he had forgotten what God had done through him at Mount
Carmel. Despite his great victory, Elijah plunged into the depths of
discouragement. How easy it is for us to do the same.

God did not accept Elijah’s notice that he was quitting. Instead, He
commissioned his tired servant to handle three major tasks (vv.15-17).
And by the way, Elijah was wrong when he said he was the only faithful
one left. God had 7,000 others who had not bowed to Baal (v.18).

Perhaps, like Elijah, you are despairing at the circumstances in your
life. Let God speak to you (v.12). Instead of allowing you to quit, He
will show you what you can do through His strength.

Reflect & Pray

Our strength and hope is in the Lord— We rest secure in His sure Word;
And though we’re tempted to despair We know we’re kept within His
care. —D. De Haan

When you’re working for Jesus, it’s always too soon to quit.
