The Rules Of Disengagement

If the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed. —
John 8:36

Today's Scripture: Genesis 50:15-21

In her book Throw Out Fifty Things, Gail Blanke outlines four “Rules
of Disengagement” to help people clear the clutter from their lives.
The first rule states: “If it . . . weighs you down, clogs you up, or
just plain makes you feel bad about yourself, throw it out, give it
away, sell it, let it go, move on.”

I think this Rule of Disengagement has a spiritual application too: We
don’t have to stay connected to past sin. Joseph’s brothers struggled
with this. Years after they sold Joseph into slavery, they recalled
their cruelty and feared revenge (Gen. 50:15). So they sent a message
to Joseph, begging for forgiveness (vv.16-17). They did this despite
previous merciful actions and reassurances from their brother
(45:4-15).

Many of us remain connected to age-old offenses despite mercy and
forgiveness from those we may have hurt. However, true freedom comes
when we confess our wrongdoing to God. He forgives it (1 John 1:9) and
separates us from it (Ps. 103:12). As one verse puts it, He throws our
sin into the depths of the sea! (Micah 7:19). Because of this, we can
remind ourselves that the Son has made us free, and we are free indeed
(John 8:36).
