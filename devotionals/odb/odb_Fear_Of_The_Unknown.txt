Fear Of The Unknown

By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called . . . . And he went out,
not knowing where he was going. —
Hebrews 11:8

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 11:8-12

Has God ever asked you to do something that seemed unreasonable?
Something that took you into the territory of the unknown? What if He
asked you to refuse a long-awaited promotion or resist a longed-for
relationship? What if He called you to a remote part of the world or
asked you to release your children to serve Him in a faraway place?

The unknown is full of haunting “what ifs.” Yet God often calls us to
chart unknown territory as we follow Him. Obeying His commands to
forgive, to give away our treasures, or to give up things that provide
security and pleasure often leave us in the scary territory of unknown
outcomes.

Imagine how Abraham felt when God asked him to move his whole family
without telling him where they were going (Gen. 12:1-3). God also
asked Abraham to persevere—to stay in an unknown land even when the
lure of past comforts may have threatened to seduce him and his family
back to their comfort zone in Ur.

Entering a new year is like entering uncharted territory. The fear of
the unknown could cripple our capacity to follow God’s leading through
the days ahead. Yet, like Abraham, when we cling to the One who knows
all things, we’re in good hands—regardless of where He leads.
