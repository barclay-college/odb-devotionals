Miracle Material

To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal? —
Isaiah 40:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 46:1-10

CNN calls a derivative of graphite a “miracle material” that could
revolutionize our future. Only one atom thick, graphene is being
hailed as a truly two-dimensional material in a 3-D world. One hundred
times stronger than steel, it is harder than diamond, conducts
electricity 1,000 times better than copper, and is more flexible than
rubber.

In and of themselves, such technological advances are neither moral
nor evil. But we are wise to remember the limitations of anything we
make for ourselves.

Isaiah spoke to a generation who found themselves carrying into
captivity gods they had made with their own hands. The prophet wanted
the Israelites to see the irony of needing to care for the silver and
gold idols they had crafted to inspire, help, comfort, and protect
them.

What was true of Israel holds true for us as well. Nothing we have
made or bought for ourselves can meet the needs of our heart. Only
God, who has been carrying us “from the womb” (Isa. 46:3-4), can carry
us into the future.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for the miracle of relationship with You. Help us
not to rely on our own efforts, strength, or possessions but instead
sense Your loving care for us.

An idol is anything that takes God’s rightful place.
