Glorifying God In Life And Death

This [Jesus] spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. —
John 21:19

Today's Scripture: John 21:12-19

It seems we most often think about how we can glorify God through our
lives when we are active and strong. But I wonder if we should also
consider how we might glorify God through our death.

After Peter denied Jesus three times (John 18:15-27), the Lord gave
him an opportunity to reaffirm his love (21:15-17). Three times, Jesus
asked, “Peter, do you love Me?” Then in a surprising change of
subject, Jesus said: “‘When you were younger, you girded yourself and
walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out
your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not
wish.’ This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God.
And when He had spoken this, He said to him, ‘Follow Me’” (vv.18-19).
Jesus told Peter that others would take him where he didn’t want to
go, yet by that unchosen way of dying, he would glorify God.

Paul said that it was his “earnest expectation and hope that in
nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now
also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death”
(Phil. 1:20).

We can bring honor and glory to God as we live—and as we die.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I want to bring You and Your name praise in my daily life till
the end. May I glorify You even in the valley of the shadow as I pass
from this life into the next. Amen.

You are one of a kind—designed to glorify God as only you can.
