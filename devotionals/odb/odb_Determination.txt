Determination

Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God. —
Ruth 1:16

Today's Scripture: Ruth 1:6,11-18;

During a television news report on the plight of refugees displaced
from a war-torn country, I was struck by the words of a 10-year-old
girl. Despite there being little possibility of returning to their
home, she showed a resilient spirit: “When we go back, I’m going to
visit my neighbors; I’m going to play with my friends,” she said with
quiet determination. “My father says we don’t have a house. And I said
we are going to fix it.”

There is a place for tenacity in life, especially when it is rooted in
our faith in God and love for others. The book of Ruth begins with
three women bound together by tragedy. After Naomi’s husband and two
sons died, she decided to return to her home in Bethlehem and urged
her widowed daughters-in-law to stay in their country of Moab. Orpah
remained but Ruth vowed to go with Naomi, saying, “Your people shall
be my people, and your God, my God” (Ruth 1:16). When Naomi saw that
Ruth “was determined to go with her” (v.18), they began their journey
together.

Stubbornness is sometimes rooted in pride, but commitment grows from
love. When Jesus went to the cross, “He steadfastly set His face to go
to Jerusalem” (Luke 9:51). From His determination to die for us, we
find the resolve to live for Him.
