You’ve Got A Friend

[Jesus said,] “I have called you friends.” —
John 15:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 23

One of the ironic consequences of the sweeping growth of social media
is that we often find ourselves more personally isolated. One online
article warns: “Those who oppose leading one’s life primarily or
exclusively online claim that virtual friends are not adequate
substitutes for real-world friends, and . . . individuals who
substitute virtual friends for physical friends become even lonelier
and more depressive than before.”

Technology aside, all of us battle with seasons of loneliness,
wondering if anyone knows, understands, or cares about the burdens we
carry or the struggles we face. But followers of Christ have an
assurance that brings comfort to our weary hearts. The comforting
presence of the Savior is promised in words that are undeniable, for
the psalmist David wrote, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your
rod and Your staff, they comfort me” (Ps. 23:4).

Whether isolated by our own choices, by the cultural trends that
surround us, or by the painful losses of life, all who know Christ can
rest in the presence of the Shepherd of our hearts. What a friend we
have in Jesus!

Reflect & Pray

I’ve found a Friend; O such a Friend! He loved me ere I knew Him; He
drew me with the cords of love, And thus He bound me to Him. —Small

Those who know Jesus as their Friend are never alone.
