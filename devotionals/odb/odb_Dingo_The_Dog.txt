Dingo The Dog

Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also the
interests of others. —
Philippians 2:4

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:1-4

Harry Tupper is a fishing legend here in Idaho where I live. There’s a
spot on Henry’s Lake over on the east side of the state that’s named
for him: “Tupper’s Hole.”

The thing I remember most about Harry, aside from his rare ability to
catch those huge Henry’s Lake trout, was his dog, Dingo. Now there was
a dog! Dingo used to sit alongside Harry in his boat and watch
intently while he fished. When the old fisherman hooked a trout, Dingo
would bark furiously until the fish was netted and released.

Dingo’s enthusiasm taught me something: It’s better to get more
excited about what others are doing than what we are doing.

So, as I read Philippians 2:4 and think about Dingo, I ask myself: Do
I spend time thinking about “the interests of others”? Do I get as
excited about what God is doing in and through a friend as I do about
what He is doing in and through me? Do I long to see others grow in
grace and find success, though it may have been my efforts that made
them prosper?

This is the measure of greatness, for we are most like God when our
thoughts for ourselves are lost in our thoughts for others. Paul said
it best: “Let each esteem others better than himself” (2:3). Is that
how we live?

Reflect & Pray

Love feels the sorrows others feel, It longs to give support, And love
is quick to take delight In every good report. —D. De Haan

A life filled with love for the Lord and for others is a fulfilling
life.
