The Mood Mender

When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy.
Psalm 94:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 94:2, 16–23

As I waited at the train station for my weekly commute, negative
thoughts crowded my mind like commuters lining up to board a
train—stress over debt, unkind remarks said to me, helplessness in the
face of a recent injustice done to a family member. By the time the
train arrived, I was in a terrible mood.

On the train, another thought came to mind: write a note to God,
giving Him my lament. Soon after I finished pouring out my complaints
in my journal, I pulled out my phone and listened to the praise songs
in my library. Before I knew it, my bad mood had completely changed.

Little did I know that I was following a pattern set by the writer of
Psalm 94. The psalmist first poured out his complaints: “Rise
up, Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve. . . .
Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for
me against evildoers?” (Psalm 94:2, 16.) He didn’t hold anything back
as he talked to God about injustice done to widows and orphans. Once
he’d made his lament to God, the psalm transitioned into praise: “But
the Lord has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take
refuge” (v. 22).

God invites us to take our laments to Him. He can turn our fear,
sadness, and helplessness into praise.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I pour out my heart to You. Take my hurts and my anger, and
grant me Your peace.

Praise has the power to lighten our heaviest burden.
