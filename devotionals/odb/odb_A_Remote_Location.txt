A Remote Location

My God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory
in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 8:1–13

Tristan da Cunha Island is famous for its isolation. It is the most
remote inhabited island in the world, thanks to the 288 people who
call it home. The island is located in the South Atlantic Ocean, 1,750
miles from South Africa—the nearest mainland. Anyone who might want to
drop by for a visit has to travel by boat for seven days because the
island has no airstrip.

Jesus and His followers were in a somewhat remote area when He
produced a miraculous meal for thousands of hungry people. Before His
miracle, Jesus said to His disciples, “[These people] have already
been with me three days and have nothing to eat. If I send them home
hungry, they will collapse on the way” (Mark 8:2-3). Because they were
in the countryside where food was not readily available, they had to
depend fully on Jesus. They had nowhere else to turn.

Sometimes God allows us to end up in desolate places where He is our
only source of help. His ability to provide for us is not necessarily
linked with our circumstances. If He created the entire world out of
nothing, God can certainly meet our needs—whatever our
circumstances—out of the riches of His glory, in Christ Jesus (Phil.
4:19).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, thank You for all that You have provided through Your Son,
Jesus Christ. You know what my needs are. Please reassure me of Your
care and power.

We can trust God to do what we cannot do.
