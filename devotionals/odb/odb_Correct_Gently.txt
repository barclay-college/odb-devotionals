Correct Gently

Put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;
bearing with one another. —
Colossians 3:12-13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:12-17

At the end of a conference in Nairobi, Kenya, our group traveled from
the conference center to a guesthouse to prepare to fly back home the
next morning. When we arrived, one person in our group reported that
she had forgotten her luggage back at the conference center. After she
left to retrieve it, our group leader (always meticulous on detail)
criticized her sharply to us in her absence.

The next morning when we arrived at the airport, the leader discovered
to his dismay that he too had left his luggage behind. It and his
passport were back at the guesthouse. It was now going to cost us even
more to go for his baggage. Later, he apologized and said to all of
us, “I’ll never criticize so harshly again!”

Because we all have faults and weaknesses, we should bear with one
another and forgive each other when things go wrong (Col. 3:13). We
need to be constructive in our criticism and “clothe [our]selves with
compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience” (v.12 niv).

When correction is necessary, it should be done with kindness and
love. In that way we become imitators of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, You know that there are times when I just don’t feel patient
and humble and gentle. Those days in my life, the fruit of Your Spirit
seems in short supply. Please enable me to love others today.

The keys to effective relationships are gentleness and humility.
