I’m Bored

I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more
abundantly. —
John 10:10

Today's Scripture: John 10:7-14

When our kids were teens, we repeatedly had the following discussion
after their church youth group meeting: I asked, “How was youth group
tonight?” And they responded, “It was boring.” After several weeks of
this, I decided to find out for myself. I slipped into the gym where
their meeting was held, and I watched. I saw them participating,
laughing, listening—having a great time. That night on the way home I
asked about their evening and, once again, they said, “It was boring.”
I responded, “I was there. I watched. You had a great time!” They
responded, “Maybe it wasn’t as bad as usual.”

I recognized that behind their reluctance to admit they were enjoying
youth group were things such as peer pressure and a fear of not
appearing “cool.” But then I wondered, Am I similarly afraid to get
too excited about spiritual things?

Indeed, there is nothing in this universe more worthy of our
enthusiasm than who Christ is and what He did for us. Jesus said, “I
have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more
abundantly” (John 10:10). That’s the opposite of boring! At any age,
we have a gift from the Savior that is worth celebrating. Our
salvation is something to get excited about!

Reflect & Pray

Father, please fill my heart with the joy of Christ. I desire that the
abundant life I have found in Him might contagiously reach out to
others around me.

If you know Christ, you always have a reason to celebrate.
