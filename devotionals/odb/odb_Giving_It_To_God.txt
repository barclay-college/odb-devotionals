Giving It To God

[He] went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. —
Mark 10:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 10:17-22

A hero to a generation of people who grew up after World War II,
Corrie ten Boom left a legacy of godliness and wisdom. A victim of the
Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, she survived to tell her story of
faith and dependence on God during horrendous suffering.

“I have held many things in my hands,” Corrie once said, “and I have
lost them all; but whatever I have placed in God’s hands, that, I
still possess.”

Corrie was well acquainted with loss. She lost family, possessions,
and years of her life to hateful people. Yet she learned to
concentrate on what could be gained spiritually and emotionally by
putting everything in the hands of her heavenly Father.

What does that mean to us? What should we place in God’s hands for
safekeeping? According to the story of the rich young man in Mark 10,
everything. He held abundance in his hands, but when Jesus asked him
to give it up, he refused. He kept his possessions and he failed to
follow Jesus—and as a result he “went away sorrowful” (v.22).

Like Corrie ten Boom, we can find hope by putting everything in God’s
hands and then trusting Him for the outcome.

Reflect & Pray

All to Jesus I surrender, All to Him I freely give; I will ever love
and trust Him, In His presence daily live. —Van de Venter

No life is more secure than a life surrendered to God.
