He Leads Me

He leads me beside the still waters. —
Psalm 23:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 23

In Istanbul, Turkey, in 2005, one sheep jumped off a cliff and then
nearly 1,500 others followed! In the end, about one-third of them
died. Not knowing which way to go, sheep mindlessly follow other
members of the flock.

No better word picture than sheep can be found to illustrate our need
for a trustworthy leader. We are all, Isaiah wrote, like sheep (Isa.
53:6). We tend to go our own way, yet we desperately need the sure
direction of a shepherd.

Psalm 23 describes the trustworthiness of our Good Shepherd. He cares
for us (v.1); He provides for our physical needs (v.2); He shows us
how to live holy lives (v.3); He restores us, comforts us, heals us,
and bountifully blesses us (vv.3-5); and He will not abandon us (v.6).

What a comfort to know that God gently but firmly leads us! He does so
through the urging of the Holy Spirit, the reading of His Word, and
through prayer. God is the reliable leader we need.

In acknowledgment of our dependence on the Lord, we can say with the
psalmist, “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to
lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters.”

Reflect & Pray

Like sheep that sometimes wander from the flock In tangled paths of
life to lose their way, I need my Shepherd’s hand and watchful eye To
keep me always, lest I go astray. —Sanders

The Lamb who died to save us is the Shepherd who lives to guide us.
