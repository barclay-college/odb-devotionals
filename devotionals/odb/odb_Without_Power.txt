Without Power

He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He
increases strength. —
Isaiah 40:29

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 40:27-31; 41:10

In late October 2012, a hurricane-spawned superstorm struck the
heavily populated northeastern US, leaving massive flooding and
destruction in its wake. During the storm, more than 8 million
customers lost electricity. Power outages alone caused shortages of
food, fuel, and water, along with the chaos of gridlocked
transportation. The howling winds and surging waters left many
neighborhoods crushed, flooded, and choked with mountains of sand.
Media coverage of the event reported: “Millions Without Power.”

Like a storm of nature, a personal tragedy can often leave us feeling
powerless and in the dark. During such times, God’s Word assures us of
His help: “He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might
He increases strength” (Isa. 40:29).

At our lowest point, drained of emotional resources, we can place our
hope in the Lord and find our strength in Him. He promises us that,
for each new day, “Those who wait on the Lord shall renew their
strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run
and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint” (v.31).

God is our spiritual power source in every storm of life.

Reflect & Pray

O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Our shelter
from the stormy blast, And our eternal home! —Watts

It takes the storm to prove the real shelter.
