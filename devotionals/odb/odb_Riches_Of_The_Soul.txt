Riches Of The Soul

Give me neither poverty nor riches—feed me with the food allotted to
me. —
Proverbs 30:8

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 30:1-9

With the hope of winning a record jackpot of $640 million, Americans
spent an estimated $1.5 billion on tickets in a multistate lottery in
early 2012. The odds of winning were a staggering 1 in 176 million,
but people stood in lines at grocery stores, gas stations, and cafes
to buy a chance to become rich. Something inside us makes us think
more money will solve our problems and improve our lives.

A man identified in the Bible as Agur had a different perspective on
riches when he asked God to grant him two requests before he died.

First, he said, “Remove falsehood and lies far from me” (Prov. 30:8).
Integrity is a key to living without anxiety. When we have nothing to
hide, we have nothing to fear. Deceit enslaves; honesty liberates.
Second, he said, “Give me neither poverty nor riches—feed me with the
food allotted to me” (v.8). Contentment springs from trusting God as
our supplier and gratefully accepting what He provides. Agur said of
the Creator that He “established all the ends of the earth. . . . He
is a shield to those who put their trust in Him” (vv.4-5).

Integrity and contentment are riches of the soul that are available to
all. Our Lord is pleased to give these treasures to everyone who asks.

Reflect & Pray

Contentment does not come from wealth— It’s not something you can buy;
Contentment comes to give you peace When you depend on God’s supply.
—Branon

Discontentment makes us poor while contentment makes us rich!
