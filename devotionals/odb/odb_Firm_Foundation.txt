Firm Foundation

Whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him
to a wise man who built his house on the rock. —
Matthew 7:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 7:21-27

Earthquakes are prevalent in the Pacific Rim region known as the “Ring
of Fire.” Ninety percent of the world’s earthquakes and 81 percent of
the world’s largest earthquakes occur there. I learned that many
buildings in the city of Hong Kong have been built on granite, which
could help minimize damage in the event of an earthquake. The
foundation of buildings is especially important in earthquake-prone
regions of the world.

Jesus Christ told His followers that a stable foundation is critical
in building lives. He said, “Therefore whoever hears these sayings of
Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his
house on the rock: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the
winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was
founded on the rock” (Matt. 7:24-25). The foundation of Jesus Christ
is what will give us the stability our hearts and lives need now and
into the future.

By allowing the Lord’s wisdom to guide us in our relationships,
decisions, and priorities, we find that He provides the most
trustworthy foundation any life could be built upon.

Reflect & Pray

Gracious Father, You are the Lord God, the King of heaven, and I
choose to place my hope in You because You alone are worthy of my
trust.

Jesus is the best foundation upon which to build a solid life.
