Growing Gratitude

For from him and through him and for him are all things.
Romans 11:36

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 11:33–36

Would you like to cultivate a greater sense of gratitude? George
Herbert, a seventeenth-century British poet, encourages readers toward
that goal in his poem “Gratefulness”: “Thou that hast given so much to
me, give one thing more: a grateful heart.”

Herbert recognized the only thing he needed in order to be thankful
was simply an awareness of the blessings God had already given him.

The Bible declares Christ Jesus as the source of all blessing in
Romans 11:36, “For from him and through him and for him are all
things.” “All things” encompasses both the extravagant and the
mundane, everyday gifts in our lives. Everything we receive in life
comes directly from our heavenly Father (James 1:17), and He willingly
gives us those gifts out of His love for us.

To expand my awareness of God’s blessings in my life, I am learning to
cultivate a heart that acknowledges the source of all the joys I
experience each day, but especially the ones I often take for granted.
Today those included a crisp morning to run, the anticipation of an
evening with friends, a stocked pantry so I could make French toast
with my daughters, the beauty of the world outside my window, and the
aroma of freshly brewed coffee.

What is the “so much” that God has already given to you? Opening our
eyes to those blessings will help us to develop grateful hearts.
