Longing for Home

They were longing for a better country—a heavenly one.
Hebrews 11:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 11:8–16

My wife walked into the room and found me poking my head inside the
cabinet of our grandfather clock. “What are you doing?” she asked.
“This clock smells just like my parents’ house,” I answered
sheepishly, closing the door. “I guess you could say I was going home
for a moment.”

The sense of smell can evoke powerful memories. We had moved the clock
across the country from my parents’ house nearly twenty years ago, but
the aroma of the wood inside it still takes me back to my childhood.

The writer of Hebrews tells of others who were longing for home in a
different way. Instead of looking backward, they were looking ahead
with faith to their home in heaven. Even though what they hoped for
seemed a long way off, they trusted that God was faithful to keep His
promise to bring them to a place where they would be with Him forever
(Heb. 11:13–16).

Philippians 3:20 reminds us that “our citizenship is in heaven,” and
we are to “eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.”
Looking forward to seeing Jesus and receiving everything God has
promised us through Him help us keep our focus. The past or the
present can never compare with what’s ahead of us!

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, thank You that You are faithful to keep Your promises. Please
help me to always look forward to You.

The best home of all is our home in heaven.
