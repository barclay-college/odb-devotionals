Undiscovered Country

The Word of God is living and powerful. —
Hebrews 4:12

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 3:14-17

I studied the map as my husband and I drove up the east coast of
Virginia. We were looking for any road that would take us to the
seashore. Finally, I found one and we turned toward the sun.

In only a few minutes, we were laughing in delight when—just before
the seashore—we happened upon a national wildlife refuge. All around
us were dunes and marsh and beach grasses and an abundance of gulls,
egrets, and blue herons. It was active and loud and wonderful! We had
arrived at Chincoteague and Assateague Islands—famous for the annual
pony swim from one island to the other. Others had realized its value
and beauty long before, but to us it was undiscovered country.

The Scriptures are like “undiscovered country” to many. They have
never discovered the valuable treasures found in the eternal words of
the Bible. The Bible is alive and powerful and sharper than any two-
edged sword, exposing our innermost thoughts and desires (Heb. 4:12).
It is like a lamp to illuminate our path (Ps. 119:105), and it has
been given to equip us for God’s purposes (2 Tim. 3:16-17).

Open the Bible and read it so you can find these treasures. It’s time
. . . to discover!
