Don’t Give Up

Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will
reap a harvest if we do not give up.
Galatians 6:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 6:1–10

Bob Foster, my mentor and friend for more than fifty years, never gave
up on me. His unchanging friendship and encouragement, even during my
darkest times, helped carry me through.

We often find ourselves determined to reach out and help someone we
know who is in great need. But when we fail to see improvement right
away, our resolve can weaken and we may eventually give up. We
discover that what we hoped would be an immediate change has become an
ongoing process.

The apostle Paul urges us to be patient in helping one another through
the stumbles and struggles of life. When he writes, “Carry each
other’s burdens” and so “fulfill the law of Christ” (Gal. 6:2), he is
comparing our task to the work, time, and waiting it takes for a
farmer to see a harvest.

How long should we keep praying and reaching out to those we love?
“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will
reap a harvest if we do not give up”  (v. 9). How many times should we
reach out? “As we have opportunity, let us do good to all people,
especially to those who belong to the family of believers” (v. 10).

The Lord encourages us today to trust Him, to remain faithful to
others, to keep on praying, and to not give up!

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, we ask for hope and perseverance to continue
reaching out to others.

In prayer we call on God “who is able to do immeasurably more than all
we ask or imagine.” Ephesians 3:20
