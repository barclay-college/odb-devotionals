Serious Fear

Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy. —
Luke 2:10

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:8-20

After weeks of preparation by the children’s choir, the night had
finally arrived for our annual Christmas musical in 1983. The costumed
children began filing into the auditorium when suddenly we heard a
ruckus at the back door. My wife and I turned to look and saw our own
little Matt. Sobbing loudly and with a look of sheer terror on his
face, he had a death grip on the door handle. He refused to enter the
auditorium. After much negotiating, the director finally told him he
didn’t have to go on stage. Instead, Matt sat with us, and soon his
fears began to subside.

Although we don’t usually identify Christmas as a time of fear, there
was plenty of it on the night of Christ’s birth. Luke says, “Behold,
an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord
shone around them, and they were greatly afraid” (Luke 2:9). The sight
of the angelic messenger was more than the shepherds could process.
But the angel reassured them: “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring
you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people” (v.10).

In a world full of fear, we need to remember that Jesus came to be the
Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6). We desperately need His peace. As we look
to Him, He will ease our fears and calm our hearts.
