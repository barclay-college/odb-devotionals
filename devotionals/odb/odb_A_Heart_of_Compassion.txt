A Heart of Compassion

Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and
patience.
Colossians 3:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:12–17

Seven of us were attending a musical production at a crowded amusement
park. Wanting to sit together, we tried to squeeze into one row. But
as we did, a woman rushed between us. My wife mentioned to her that we
wanted to stay together, but the woman quickly said, “Too bad,” as she
and her two companions pushed on into the row.

As three of us sat one row behind the other four, my wife, Sue,
noticed that the woman had an adult with her who appeared to have
special needs. She had been trying to keep her little group together
so she could take care of her friend. Suddenly, our irritation faded.
Sue said, “Imagine how tough things are for her in a crowded place
like this.” Yes, perhaps the woman did respond rudely. But we could
respond with compassion rather than anger.

Wherever we go, we will encounter people who need compassion. Perhaps
these words from the apostle Paul can help us view everyone around us
in a different light—as people who need the gentle touch of grace. “As
God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with
compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience” (Col. 3:12).
He also suggests that we “bear with each other and forgive one
another” (v. 13).

As we show compassion, we will be pointing others to the One who
poured out His heart of grace and compassion on us.

Reflect & Pray

Your compassions never fail, Father. May we mirror Your heart by
showing compassion to others.

Compassion is understanding the troubles of others.
