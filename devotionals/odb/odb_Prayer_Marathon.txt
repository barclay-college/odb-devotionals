Prayer Marathon

Pray continually.
1 Thessalonians 5:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:16-28

Do you struggle to maintain a consistent prayer life? Many of us do.
We know that prayer is important, but it can also be downright
difficult. We have moments of deep communion with God and then we have
times when it feels like we’re just going through the motions. Why do
we struggle so in our prayers?

The life of faith is a marathon. The ups, the downs, and the plateaus
in our prayer life are a reflection of this race. And just as in a
marathon we need to keep running, so we keep praying. The point is:
Don’t give up!

That is God’s encouragement too. The apostle Paul said, “pray
continually” (1 Thess. 5:17), “keep on praying” (Rom. 12:12 nlt), and
“devote yourselves to prayer” (Col. 4:2). All of these statements
carry the idea of remaining steadfast and continuing in the work of
prayer.

And because God, our heavenly Father, is a personal being, we can
develop a time of close communion with Him, just as we do with our
close human relationships. A. W. Tozer writes that as we learn to
pray, our prayer life can grow “from the initial most casual brush to
the fullest, most intimate communion of which the human soul is
capable.” And that’s what we really want—deep communication with God.
It happens when we keep praying.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, we often struggle to spend time with You. Help us to make
the time, and help us sense Your goodness and presence.

There is never a day when we don’t need to pray.
