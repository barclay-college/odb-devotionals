Extraordinary Showers

There shall be showers of blessing. —
Ezekiel 34:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ezekiel 34:25-31

What do fish, tadpoles, and spiders have in common? They have all
fallen from the sky like rain in various parts of the world. Fish fell
on the Australian town of Lajamanu. Tadpoles pelted areas of central
Japan on multiple occasions. Spiders showered down on the San Bernardo
Mountains in Argentina. Although scientists suspect that the wind
plays a part in these intriguing showers, no one can fully explain
them.

The prophet Ezekiel described a far more extraordinary downpour—a
shower of blessing (Ezek. 34:26). Ezekiel spoke of a time when God
would send blessings like rain to refresh His people. The Israelites
would be safe from enemy nations. They would have enough food, be
liberated from slavery, and be freed from shame (vv.27-29). These
gifts would revive Israel’s relationship with God. The people would
know that God was with them, and that “they, the house of Israel,
[were His] people” (v.30).

God blesses His modern-day followers too (James 1:17). Sometimes
blessings abound like rain; sometimes they trickle in one by one.
Whether many or few, the good things we receive come with a message
from God: I see your needs. You are mine, and I will care for you.
