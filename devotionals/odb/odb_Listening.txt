Listening

Oh, that I had one to hear me! —
Job 31:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 2:11-13

In her book Listening to Others, Joyce Huggett writes about the
importance of learning to listen and respond effectively to those in
difficult situations. As she relates some of her own experiences of
listening to suffering people, she mentions that they often thank her
for all she’s done for them. “On many occasions,” she writes, “I have
not ‘done’ anything. I have ‘just listened.’ I quickly came to the
conclusion that ‘just listening’ was indeed an effective way of
helping others.”

This was the help Job sought from his friends. While it is true that
they sat with him for 7 days in silence, “for they saw that his grief
was very great” (2:13), they didn’t listen when Job started talking.
Instead, they talked and talked but failed to comfort him (16:2). “Oh,
that I had one to hear me!” Job cried (31:35).

Listening says, “What matters to you matters to me.” Sometimes people
do want advice. But often they just want to be listened to by someone
who loves and cares about them.

Listening is hard work, and it takes time. It takes time to listen
long enough to hear the other person’s true heart, so that if we do
speak, we speak with gentle wisdom.

Oh, Lord, give us a loving heart and a listening ear.

Reflect & Pray

I cried, and from His holy hill He bowed a listening ear; I called my
Father, and my God, And He subdued my fear. —Watts

When I’m thinking about an answer while others are talking—I’m not
listening.
