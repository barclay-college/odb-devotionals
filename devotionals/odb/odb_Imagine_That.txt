Imagine That!

Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, . . . rightly
dividing the Word of truth. —
2 Timothy 2:15

Today's Scripture: 2 Peter 1:16-21

My friends and I were anticipating a contemplative time looking at a
collection of artwork about the prodigal son who returned home to a
forgiving father (Luke 15). When we arrived at the information table,
we noticed the brochures, books, and a sign pointing to the artwork.

Also on the table was a dinner plate with bread, a napkin, and a
glass. Each of us privately pondered what the significance of the
plate could be. We wondered if it represented communion fellowship
between the prodigal son and his father when he returned home. But as
we examined it more closely, we realized simultaneously: Someone had
left a dirty plate on the display table. And it wasn’t bread, but
leftover cookie bars! Our imaginations had been wrong.

We had a good laugh, but then it made me think about how sometimes we
imagine more than what’s really there while reading the Bible. Rather
than assuming that our speculation is correct, however, we need to be
sure our interpretation fits with the whole of Scripture. Peter said
that “no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation” (2
Peter 1:20). As we depend on the Spirit’s instruction, a careful study
of the context, and the wisdom of respected Bible teachers, we’ll
avoid seeing things in the Word that aren’t really there.

Reflect & Pray

We must correctly hear God’s Word, Or we will be misled; We must give
careful thought and prayer To what the Author said. —Hess

A text out of context is often a dangerous pretext.
