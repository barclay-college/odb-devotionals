Watch and Pray

Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.
Mark 14:38

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 14:32–42

From my window I can see a 1,700-meter hill called the Cerro del
Borrego or “Hill of the Sheep.” In 1862, the French army invaded
Mexico. While the enemy camped in the central park of Orizaba, the
Mexican army established its position at the top of the hill. However,
the Mexican general neglected to guard access to the top. While the
Mexican troops were sleeping, the French attacked and killed 2,000 of
them.

This reminds me of another hill, the Mount of Olives, and the garden
at its foot where a group of disciples fell asleep. Jesus rebuked
them, saying, “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into
temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak” (Mark
14:38).

How easy it is to sleep or become careless in our Christian walk.
Temptation strikes when we are most vulnerable. When we neglect
certain areas of our spiritual lives—such as prayer and Bible study—we
become drowsy and let our guard down, making us easy targets for our
enemy, Satan, to strike (1 Peter 5:8).

We need to be alert to the possibilities of an attack and pray to
maintain vigilance. If we remain watchful and pray—for ourselves and
for others—the Spirit will enable us to resist temptation.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, I know my spirit is willing, but my body is weak. Help me
to watch and pray today for myself and for others.

Satan is powerless against the power of Christ.
