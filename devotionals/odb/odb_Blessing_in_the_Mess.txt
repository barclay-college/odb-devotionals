Blessing in the Mess

He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until
the day of Christ Jesus.
Philippians 1:6

Today's Scripture: Genesis 28:10–22

I got myself into this mess, so I’d better get myself out, I sometimes
find myself thinking.  Although I believe in a God of grace, I’m still
prone to act as if His help is available only when I deserve it.

God’s first encounter with Jacob is a beautiful illustration of how
untrue this is.

Jacob had spent a lifetime trying to alter his destiny. He’d been born
second at a time when firstborn sons typically received their father’s
blessing—believed to guarantee future prosperity.

So Jacob decided to do whatever it would take to get his father’s
blessing anyway. Eventually, he succeeded—through deceit—obtaining the
blessing intended for his brother (Genesis 27:19–29).

But the price was a divided family, as Jacob fled from his furious
brother (vv. 41–43). As night descended (28:11), Jacob must have felt
as far from a life of blessing as ever.

But it was there, leaving behind a trail of deception, that Jacob met
God. God showed him he didn’t need desperate schemes to be blessed; he
already was. His destiny—a purpose far greater than material
prosperity (v. 14)—was held securely by the One who would never leave
him (v. 15).

It was a lesson Jacob would spend his whole life learning.

And so will we. No matter how many regrets we carry or how distant God
seems, He is still there—gently guiding us out of our mess into His
blessing.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, so often we feel trapped by our mistakes, thinking there’s no
future left for us. Remind us that you are the God of Jacob, the God
who will never give up on Your purposes for us.

God never gives up on His love and purposes for our lives.
