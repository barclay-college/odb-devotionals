Human Race

[Jesus] said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and
get some rest.”
Mark 6:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 6:7–13, 30–32

The alarm clock goes off. Too early, it seems. But you have a long day
ahead. You have work to do, appointments to keep, people to care for,
or all this and more. Well, you are not alone. Each day, many of us
rush from one matter to another. As someone has wittily suggested,
“That’s why we are called the human race.”

When the apostles returned from their first mission trip, they had a
lot to report. But Mark did not record Jesus’s evaluation of the
disciples’ work; rather, he focused on His concern that they rest
awhile. Jesus said, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and
get some rest” (6:31).

Ultimately, we find true rest through recognizing the presence of God
and trusting Him. While we take our responsibilities seriously, we
also recognize that we can relax our grip on our work and careers, our
families and ministry, and give them over to God in faith. We can take
time each day to tune out the distractions, put away the tense
restlessness, and reflect in gratitude on the wonder of God’s love and
faithfulness.

So feel free to stop and take a breath. Get some real rest.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I thank You today for all You have given me to do. Help me to
truly rest in You—physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

We do not rest because our work is done; we rest because God commanded
it and created us to have a need for it. Gordon MacDonald
