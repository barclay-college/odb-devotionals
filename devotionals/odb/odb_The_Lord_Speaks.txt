The Lord Speaks

Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him?
Job 40:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 38:1–11

We can find nearly every argument in the book of Job about why there
is pain in the world, but the arguing never seems to help Job much.
His is a crisis of relationship more than a crisis of doubt. Can he
trust God? Job wants one thing above all else: an appearance by the
one Person who can explain his miserable fate. He wants to meet God
Himself, face to face.

Eventually Job gets his wish. God shows up in person (see Job 38:1).
He times His entrance with perfect irony, just as Job’s friend Elihu
is expounding on why Job has no right to expect a visit from God.

No one—not Job, nor any of his friends—is prepared for what God has to
say. Job has saved up a long list of questions, but it is God, not
Job, who asks the questions. “Brace yourself like a man,” He begins;
“I will question you, and you shall answer me” (v. 3). Brushing aside
thirty-five chapters’ worth of debates on the problem of pain, God
plunges into a majestic poem on the wonders of the natural world.

God’s speech defines the vast difference between the God of all
creation and one puny man like Job. His presence spectacularly answers
Job’s biggest question: Is anybody out there? Job can only respond,
“Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful
for me to know” (42:3).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we have so many questions about life and its unfairness. You
have shown Yourself good to us. Help us to trust You for what we
cannot understand.

No calamity is beyond God’s sovereignty.
