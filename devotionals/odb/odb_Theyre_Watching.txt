They’re Watching

Speak evil of no one, . . . be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility
to all men. —
Titus 3:2

Today's Scripture: Titus 3:1-8

It’s been several decades since a high school event devastated me.
Playing sports was hugely important to me. I zeroed in on basketball
and spent hundreds of hours practicing my game. So when I didn’t make
the varsity team in my last year after being on the team since junior
high, I was crushed.

Disappointed and confused, I carried on. I became a stats guy for the
team, going to games and keeping track of my friends’ rebounds and
shots as they got within one game of the state championship without
me. To be honest, I never thought of how they were viewing my
response. I just muddled through. That’s why I was surprised recently
to hear that several of my classmates told my brother that they saw in
my response a lesson in Christianity—a picture of Christ. My point is
not to tell you to do as I did, because I’m not sure what I did. My
point is this: Whether we know it or not, people are watching us.

In Titus 3:1-8, Paul explains the life God enables us to live—a life
of respect, obedience, and kindness that results from being reborn
through Jesus and renewed by the Holy Spirit who has been poured out
on us.

As we live a Spirit-guided life, God will show the reality of His
presence to others through us.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, You know how inadequate I am. Please equip me through the
Spirit to show love and respect in my life so that others will see
through me and see You.

A Christian is a living sermon whether or not he preaches a word.
