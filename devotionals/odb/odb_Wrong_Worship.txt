Wrong Worship

This trade of ours [is] in danger of falling into disrepute. —
Acts 19:27

Today's Scripture: Acts 19:23-41

If you really want to get folks upset, threaten their economy.

A bad economic picture gets politicians voted out of office, and the
threat of a downturn nearly got the apostle Paul kicked out of
Ephesus.

Here’s what happened. Paul came to town and started “reasoning and
persuading concerning . . . the kingdom of God” (Acts 19:8). For more
than 2 years he shared the gospel, and many began following Jesus.

Because Paul was so successful in getting people to see that there is
only one true God, many Ephesians stopped worshiping the goddess
Diana. This was bad news for the local silversmiths, who made their
living creating and selling Diana statuettes. If enough people stopped
believing in her, business would dry up. A commotion and an uproar
broke out when the craftsmen figured this out.

This Ephesus incident can remind us to evaluate our reasons for
worshiping God. The silversmiths wanted to protect their worship as a
way of protecting their prosperity, but may that never be said of us.
Don’t ever let your worship of God become an avenue to good fortune.

We worship God because of His love for us and because of who He is,
not because loving Him can help our bottom line. Let’s worship God the
right way.

Reflect & Pray

We worship God for who He is, And not because of what we’ll get; When
we acknowledge what we owe, We’ll thank Him that He paid our debt.
—Sper

Don’t worship God to gain His benefits— you already have them.
