Sharing A Burger

Do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is
well pleased. —
Hebrews 13:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 2:14-17

Lee Geysbeek of Compassion International told about a woman who had
the opportunity to travel to a distant land to visit the child she
sponsored. She decided to take the child, who was living in abject
poverty, to a restaurant.

The boy ordered a hamburger, and the sponsor ordered a salad. When the
food came to the table, the boy, who assuredly had never had such a
meal in his life, surveyed the scene. He looked at his huge hamburger
and over at his sponsor’s small salad. Then he took his knife and cut
the burger in half, offered it to his sponsor, rubbed his tummy, and
asked, “Hungry?”

A child who had next to nothing his whole life was willing to share
half of what he had with someone he thought might need more. This
child can be a good reminder the next time we meet someone in
physical, emotional, or spiritual need. As followers of Jesus, our
faith in Him should be mirrored through our actions (James 2:17).

We encounter people in need every day. Some around the globe, some
simply around the corner. Some in need of a warm meal, others a kind
word. What a difference followers of Christ, who have experienced His
love, could make by doing good and sharing (Heb. 13:16).

Reflect & Pray

Today, Lord, help me see beyond my own problems to the needs of
others. Guide my hand to give instead of get, to offer instead of ask,
and to bless instead of seeking blessings. May Your name be honored.

To be doing good is man’s most glorious task. —Sophocles
