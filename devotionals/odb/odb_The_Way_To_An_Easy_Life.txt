The Way To An “Easy” Life

No one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know
that we are appointed to this. —
1 Thessalonians 3:3

Today's Scripture: 1 Thessalonians 3

Are parents trying too hard to make their kids happy? And is that
having the opposite effect? These questions introduce an interview
with Lori Gottlieb, author of an article on the subject of unhappy
young adults. Her conclusion: Yes. Parents who refuse to let their
children experience failure or sadness give them a false view of the
world and do not prepare them for the harsh realities of adult life.
They’re left feeling empty and anxious.

Some Christians expect that the Lord will be the kind of parent who
protects them from all sorrow and disappointment. But that’s not the
kind of Father He is. He lovingly allows His children to go through
suffering (Isa. 43:2; 1 Thess. 3:3).

When we start with the mistaken belief that it’s an easy life that
will make us truly happy, we become weary trying to live out our
faulty belief. But when we face the truth that life is difficult, we
can invest our lives in the pursuit of a good and godly life instead.
That kind of life strengthens us for the times when life is difficult.

God’s goal is to make us holy, not just happy (1 Thess. 3:13). And
when we are holy, we are more likely to be truly happy and content.

Reflect & Pray

Must I be carried to the skies On flowery beds of ease, While others
fought to win the prize, And sailed through bloody seas? —Watts

A contented person has learned to accept the bitter with the sweet.
