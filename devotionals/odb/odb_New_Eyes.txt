New Eyes

The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know .
. . the riches of the glory of His inheritance. —
Ephesians 1:18

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 1:15-21

A college student I met had recently placed her faith in Christ. She
described her initial life-change this way: “When I trusted Christ for
salvation, it felt like God reached down from heaven and placed a new
set of eyes in my eye sockets. I could understand spiritual truth!”

It was moving to hear how her encounter with the Savior brought new
spiritual perception. But her experience is not unique. Everyone is
endowed with spiritual sight when they trust Christ as their Savior.
Yet, at times a “fog” rolls in and our spiritual vision becomes cloudy
and unclear. That happens when we neglect our relationship with Him.

In Paul’s fervent prayer for believers’ spiritual sight, we see how
important it is to fully appreciate all that God has done and will do
for us through Christ. He prayed that the eyes of our understanding
would be enlightened that we “may know what is the hope of His
calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the
saints” (Eph. 1:18).

Each believer has been given new eyes to discern spiritual truth. As
we keep our hearts tuned to God, He will help us to see with our
spiritual eyes all that He has given to us in Christ.

Reflect & Pray

My soul within me yearns for Thee Till Christ be fully formed in me;
Let love divine enlarge my heart, Then all Thy fullness, Lord, impart.
