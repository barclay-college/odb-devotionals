Learning From The Redwoods

As the days of a tree, so shall be the days of My people. —
Isaiah 65:22

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 65:17–66:2

North America’s Pacific Coast Redwoods are some of the biggest trees
in the world. The tallest on record, Hyperion, soars 379 feet into the
air.

During a visit to California’s Muir Woods National Park, I was
surprised and overwhelmed by the enormity of those redwoods. Trees as
tall as a 30- story building seemed to press me into the forest floor
while drawing my thoughts upward.

The memory of what I felt at the base of some of the tallest and
oldest trees in the world has left me with lingering thoughts about
their origin. Those redwoods, like the family tree of our own
humanity, are rooted in a Creator who is infinitely and eternally
greater than His creation.

The prophet Isaiah caught a glimpse of this God. In a vision that
mingled the wonders of a Messianic kingdom with the promise of a new
heaven and earth, he describes One who makes the skies His throne and
the earth His footstool (Isa. 66:1).

Yet Isaiah saw something even more overwhelming. He saw a great God
who wants His people to “be glad and rejoice forever in what I create”
(65:18). In response, let’s bow before Him in humble adoration (66:2).

Reflect & Pray

How glorious to think ahead Of blessings yet to be, Of help from God
while life shall last— Then joys eternally! —Branon

God’s work of creating is done; our work of praising has only begun.
