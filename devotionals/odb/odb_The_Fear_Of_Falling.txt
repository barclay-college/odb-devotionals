The Fear Of Falling

The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting
arms. —
Deuteronomy 33:27

Today's Scripture: Psalm 46

Have you ever dreamed that you were falling out of bed or from some
great height, and you awoke in fright? I remember that as a boy I
would often be awakened by such a terrifying feeling.

I heard about a man who had this sensation as soon as he slipped into
sleep. He was so rudely awakened by his sense of falling that he was
afraid to go back to sleep. He feared he would die, and he imagined he
was falling into a bottomless pit.

Then one evening as he was strolling through a cemetery, he saw this
phrase engraved on a tombstone:

Underneath Are The Everlasting Arms

These words reminded him that when believers die, they are safely
carried by the Lord to their home in heaven. He recalled the assurance
of the psalmist, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me” (Ps. 23:4).

The once-fearful man realized that in life and in death— and even in
sleep—the “everlasting arms” of our loving Lord are there to catch and
hold us. That night he was able to sing what he was taught in
childhood, “Teach me to live that I may dread the grave as little as
my bed!” At last he could fall asleep without fear.

Reflect & Pray

I can trust my loving Savior When I fear the world’s alarms; There’s
no safer place of resting Than His everlasting arms. —Hess

You can trust God in the dark as well as in the light.
