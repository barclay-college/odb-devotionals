Just a Touch

Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man.
Matthew 8:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 8:1–4

Kiley leaped at the chance to go to a remote area of East Africa to
assist a medical mission, yet she felt uneasy. She didn’t have any
medical experience. Still, she could provide basic care.

While there, she met a woman with a horrible but treatable disease.
The woman’s distorted leg repulsed her, but Kiley knew she had to do
something. As she cleaned and bandaged the leg, her patient began
crying. Concerned, Kiley asked if she was hurting her. “No,” she
replied. “It’s the first time anyone has touched me in nine years.”

Leprosy is another disease that can render its victims repulsive to
others, and ancient Jewish culture had strict guidelines to prevent
its spread: “They must live alone,” the law declared. “They must live
outside the camp” (Lev. 13:46).

That’s why it’s so remarkable that a leper approached Jesus to say,
“Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean” (Matt. 8:2). “Jesus
reached out his hand and touched the man. ‘I am willing,’ he said. ‘Be
clean!’ ” (v. 3).

In touching a lonely woman’s diseased leg, Kiley began to show the
fearless, bridge-building love of Jesus. A single touch made a
difference.
