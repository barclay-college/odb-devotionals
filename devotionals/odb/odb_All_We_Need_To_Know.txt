All We Need To Know

For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells. —
Romans 7:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 7:18-25

In a Fernando Ortega rendition of “Just As I Am,” Billy Graham’s voice
can be heard faintly in the background. Dr. Graham is reminiscing
about an illness during which he believed he was dying. As he mused on
his past, he realized what a great sinner he was and how much he
continues to need God’s daily forgiveness.

Billy Graham was putting an end to the notion that apart from God
we’re okay. We can feel good about ourselves, but that confidence must
come from the knowledge that we’re greatly loved children of God (John
3:16), not that we’re very good children (Rom. 7:18).

The first step in becoming a truly “good” person as a follower of
Christ is to stop pretending that we’re good on our own and to ask God
to make us as good as we can be. We will fail many times, but He will
keep growing us and changing us. God is faithful and—in His time and
in His way—He’ll do it.

In his final years, the writer of “Amazing Grace,” John Newton,
suffered from dementia and lamented the loss of his memory. Yet he
confided, “I do remember two things: I am a great sinner, and Jesus is
a great Savior.” When it comes to faith, those are the only things
anyone needs to know.

Reflect & Pray

The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures; He will my
shield and portion be As long as life endures. —Newton

God’s grace accepted is God’s peace experienced.
