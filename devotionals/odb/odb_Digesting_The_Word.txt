Digesting The Word

Your Word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart. —
Jeremiah 15:16

Today's Scripture: Jeremiah 15:15-21

King James is famous for the Bible translation that bears his name.
Around the same time as the printing of the Bible, he also made
revisions to The Book of Common Prayer. Still used today, this guide
to intercession and worship contains a marvelous prayer for
internalizing the Bible: “Blessed Lord, who hast caused all holy
Scriptures to be written for our learning; grant that we may . . .
hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by
patience, and comfort of [Your] holy Word, we may embrace and ever
hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life.”

Many centuries earlier, Jeremiah the prophet expressed a similar way
of letting the Scriptures nourish our hearts: “Your words were found,
and I ate them; and Your Word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my
heart: for I am called by Your name, O Lord God of hosts” (Jer.
15:16). We internalize the Word as we “read, mark, learn, and inwardly
digest” a passage of Scripture through prayerful meditation.

Ask the Lord to help you apply the Bible to your heart today. Take
time to ponder the meat and milk of the Word (Heb. 5:12). As you quiet
your heart, God will teach you about Himself through His Book.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I meditate on Your precepts and contemplate Your ways. I delight
myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your Word. Open my eyes
that I may see wondrous things from Your law.

Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to
be chewed and digested. —Bacon
