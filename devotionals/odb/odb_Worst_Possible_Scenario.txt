Worst Possible Scenario!

When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold. —
Job 23:10

Today's Scripture: Job 1:13-22

When I used to teach at a Bible college in a large city, I sometimes
graded papers at a food court while waiting for a commuter train. One
day, I accidentally bumped my large cup of coffee. Its entire contents
emptied into my open briefcase.

In most cities, there is a quiet reserve on the part of commuters.
However, the coffee splash was so dramatic that it could not be
ignored. A man sitting nearby said aloud, “Worst possible scenario!”

That comment was obviously an overstatement. But each of us dreads the
thought of something in particular: financial loss, the death of a
child or spouse, cancer, or another loss or hardship.

The book of Job is a case study in worst possible scenarios. Yet Job
wisely assessed God’s role in trying circumstances of loss and poor
health: “He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I shall
come forth as gold” (Job 23:10). From this wise statement we can learn
two valuable lessons: One is that what we dread most can be used to
test our character and make us stronger. The other is that God will
provide the strength and comfort to see us through.

Cling to God. He has promised to work on our behalf, even in the worst
possible scenario.

Reflect & Pray

God often sends me joy through pain, Through bitter loss, divinest
gain; Yet through it all—dark days or bright— I know my Father leads
aright. —Conklin

The living God can take the fear out of living.
