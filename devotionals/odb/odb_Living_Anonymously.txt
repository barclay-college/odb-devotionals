Living Anonymously

Let us have real warm affection for one another as between [family].
Romans 12:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 12:1–13

My well-worn and often-read copy of Jane Yolen’s essay “Working Up to
Anon” (Anonymous) was clipped from The Writer magazine many years ago.
“The best writers,” she says, “are the ones who really, in their heart
of hearts, aspire to the byline Anon. The story told is important, not
the storyteller.”

The story we tell is about Jesus, the Savior, who gave His life for
us. Together with other believers we live for Him and share His love
with others.

Romans 12:3–21 describes the attitude of humility and love that should
permeate our relationships with each other as followers of Jesus.
“Don’t cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself or your importance, but
try to have a sane estimate of your capabilities by the light of the
faith that God has given to you all. . . . Let us have real warm
affection for one another as between [family], and a willingness to
let the other [person] have the credit” (vv. 3, 10 J.B. Phillips New
Testament).

Pride in our past accomplishments can blind us to the gifts of others.
Arrogance can poison the future.

John the Baptist, whose mission was to pave the way for Jesus, said,
“He must become greater; I must become less” (John 3:30).

That’s a good motto for us all.

Reflect & Pray

I admit, Lord, that I have a lot to learn about humility. Help me to
see You for who You are so You and others have their rightful place in
my life.

Always be humble before God and allow Him to be your all in all.
Oswald Chambers
