Not Saying Goodbye

The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me,
these do, and the God of peace will be with you. —
Philippians 4:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:1-9

Francis Allen led me to Jesus, and now it was nearly time for Francis
to meet Jesus face to face. I was at his home as it grew time for him
to say goodbye. I wanted to say something memorable and meaningful.

For nearly an hour I stood by his bed. He laughed hard at the stories
I told on myself. Then he got tired, we got serious, and he spent his
energy rounding off some rough edges he still saw in my life. I
listened, even as I tried to sort out how to say goodbye.

He stopped me before I got the chance. “You remember, Randy, what I’ve
always told you. We have nothing to fear from the story of life
because we know how it ends. I’m not afraid. You go do what I’ve
taught you.” Those challenging words reminded me of what the apostle
Paul said to the believers in Philippi: “The things which you learned
and received and heard and saw in me, these do” (Phil. 4:9).

Francis had the same twinkle in his eye this last day I saw him as he
had the first day I met him. He had no fear in his heart.

So many of the words I write, stories I tell, and people I serve are
touched by Francis. As we journey through life, may we remember those
who have encouraged us spiritually.
