Shine Through

Let your light shine before others.
Matthew 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 5:13-16

A little girl wondered what a saint might be. One day her mother took
her to a great cathedral to see the gorgeous stained-glass windows
with scenes from the Bible. When she saw the beauty of it all she
cried out loud, “Now I know what saints are. They are people who let
the light shine through!”

Some of us might think that saints are people of the past who lived
perfect lives and did Jesus-like miracles. But when a translation of
Scripture uses the word saint, it is actually referring to anyone who
belongs to God through faith in Christ. In other words, saints are
people like us who have the high calling of serving God while
reflecting our relationship with Him wherever we are and in whatever
we do. That is why the apostle Paul prayed that the eyes and
understanding of his readers would be opened to think of themselves as
the treasured inheritance of Christ and saints of God (Eph. 1:18).

So what then do we see in the mirror? No halos or stained glass. But
if we are fulfilling our calling, we will look like people who, maybe
even without realizing it, are letting the rich colors of the love,
joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-
control of God shine through.
