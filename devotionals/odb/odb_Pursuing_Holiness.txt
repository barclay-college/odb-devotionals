Pursuing Holiness

Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will
see the Lord. —
Hebrews 12:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 6:14-23

We often see surveys that ask people if they are happy, satisfied with
their work, or enjoying life. But I’ve never seen an opinion poll that
asked, “Are you holy?” How would you answer that question?

One Bible dictionary defines holiness as “separation to God and
conduct fitting for those separated.” Author Frederick Buechner said
that when writing about a person’s character, “nothing is harder to
make real than holiness.” He adds that “holiness is not a human
quality at all, like virtue. Holiness is . . . not something that
people do, but something that God does in them.”

Romans 6 presents the stunning gift that God gives us through faith in
Christ: “We were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just
as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so
we also should walk in newness of life” (v.4). The pursuit of holiness
occurs daily as we yield ourselves in obedience to the Lord instead of
following our old ways of self-gratification. “Now you are free from
the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those
things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life” (v.22 nlt).

Are you becoming more holy? By God’s grace and power, the answer can
be a resounding “Yes! More and more each day.”

Reflect & Pray

Father, I want to cooperate with You in Your work of changing me to
become more like Jesus. Help me to walk in Your ways. Without Your
work in me, nothing of lasting value will occur in my growth in
holiness.

The choice to pursue holiness is a matter of life or death.
