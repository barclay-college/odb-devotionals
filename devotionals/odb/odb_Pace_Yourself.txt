Pace Yourself

Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while. —
Mark 6:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 6:30-36

Not long ago I developed a physical problem. My left shoulder and arm
were aching, I had a painful rash on my forearm and thumb, and I
struggled daily with fatigue. When I finally went to the doctor, I
learned that I had a case of shingles. The doctor put me on antiviral
medication and said it would take several weeks for the disease to run
its course.

Because of this illness, I had to force myself into a new routine. A
short nap in the morning and one in the afternoon were necessary to
give me the strength to be productive. Until I recovered, I had to
learn to pace myself.

At one point when Jesus sent His representatives out to teach in His
name, they were so excited with all they were doing that they
neglected to take time to eat and rest properly. When they returned,
Christ told them: “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and
rest a while” (Mark 6:31).

Everyone needs rest, and if we go too long without it, we will suffer
physically and emotionally. We also will be unable to carry out our
responsibilities as well as we should. Is the Lord encouraging you to
“come aside . . . and rest a while”? Sometimes a few more rest stops
with Him may be necessary.

Reflect & Pray

I come aside from the world of strife, With its burdens, trials, and
the cares of life To a beautiful, quiet, restful place Where I commune
with my Jesus face to face. —Brandt

To avoid a breakdown, take a break for rest and prayer.
