Flight Simulator

These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. —
John 16:33

Today's Scripture: John 16:25-33

When airplane pilots are training, they spend many hours in flight
simulators. These simulators give the students a chance to experience
the challenges and dangers of flying an aircraft—but without the risk.
The pilots don’t have to leave the ground, and if they crash in the
simulation, they can calmly walk away.

Simulators are tremendous teaching tools—helpful in preparing the
aspiring pilot to take command of an actual aircraft. The devices,
however, have a shortcoming. They create an artificial experience in
which the full-blown pressures of handling a real cockpit cannot be
fully replicated.

Real life is like that, isn’t it? It cannot be simulated. There is no
safe, risk-free environment in which we can experience life’s ups and
downs unharmed. The risks and dangers of living in a broken world are
inescapable. That’s why the words of Jesus are so reassuring. He said,
“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In
the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have
overcome the world” (John 16:33).

Although we can’t avoid the dangers of life in a fallen world, we can
have peace through a relationship with Jesus. He has secured our
ultimate victory.

Reflect & Pray

Outward troubles may not cease, But this your joy will be: “Thou wilt
keep him in perfect peace Whose mind is stayed on Thee.” —Anon.

No life is more secure than a life surrendered to God.
