Sweet and Bitter

You are good, and what you do is good.
Psalm 119:68

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:65–72

Some people like bitter chocolate and some prefer sweet. Ancient
Mayans in Central America enjoyed chocolate as a beverage and seasoned
it with chili peppers. They liked this “bitter water,” as they called
it. Many years later it was introduced in Spain, but the Spaniards
preferred chocolate sweet, so they added sugar and honey to counteract
its natural bitterness.

Like chocolate, days can be bitter or sweet as well. A seventeenth-
century French monk named Brother Lawrence wrote, “If we knew how much
[God] loves us, we would always be ready to receive equally . . . from
His hand the sweet and the bitter.” Accept the sweet and the bitter
equally? This is difficult! What is Brother Lawrence talking about?
The key lies in God’s character. The psalmist said of God, “You are
good, and what you do is good” (Psalm 119:68).

Mayans also valued bitter chocolate for its healing and medicinal
properties. Bitter days have value too. They make us aware of our
weaknesses and they help us depend more on God. The psalmist wrote,
“It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your
decrees” (v. 71). Let us embrace life today, with its different
flavors—reassured of God’s goodness. Let us say, “You have done many
good things for me, Lord , just as you promised” (v. 65 nlt ).
