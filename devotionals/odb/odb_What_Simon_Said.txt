What Simon Said

Simon answered, . . . “But because you say so, I will let down the
nets."
Luke 5:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 5:1–11

A man named Refuge Rabindranath has been a youth worker in Sri Lanka
for more than ten years. He often interacts with the youth late into
the night—playing with them, listening to them, counseling and
teaching them. He enjoys working with the young people, but it can be
disheartening when promising students sometimes walk away from the
faith. Some days he feels a bit like Simon Peter in Luke 5.

Simon had been working hard all night but caught no fish (v. 5). He
felt discouraged and tired. Yet when Jesus told him to “put out into
deep water, and let down the nets for a catch” (v. 4), Simon replied,
“Because you say so, I will let down the nets” (v. 5).

Simon’s obedience is remarkable. As a seasoned fisherman, he knew that
fish move to the bottom of the lake when the sun is up, and the
dragnets they used could not go deep enough to catch those fish.

His willingness to trust Jesus was rewarded. Not only did Simon catch
a large number of fish, he gained a deeper understanding of who Jesus
is. He moved from calling Jesus “Master” (v. 5) to calling Him “Lord”
(v. 8). Indeed, “listening” often allows us to see the works of God
firsthand and draw closer to Him.

Perhaps God is calling you to “let down your nets again.” May we reply
to the Lord as Simon did: “Because You say so, I will.”

Reflect & Pray

Father, it is our great privilege to call You “Lord.” Help us to obey
and trust You, and to learn more of what it means to walk closely with
You.

Our obedience to God will guide us through the unknown and draw us
closer to Him.
