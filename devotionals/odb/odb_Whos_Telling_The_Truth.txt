Who’s Telling The Truth?

Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you
not believe Me? —
John 8:46

Today's Scripture: John 8:31-47

During the 2012 US presidential campaign, television coverage of
speeches and debates often included “fact checking” by analysts who
compared the candidates’ statements with their actual records. Were
they telling the truth or manipulating the facts to their advantage?

The apostle John recorded a debate between Jesus and a group of people
who believed He was making false claims about Himself. Jesus told
them, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you
shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John
8:31-32). They told Him that they had never been in bondage to anyone
and asked, “How can You say, ‘You will be made free’?” (v.33).

As the debate continued, Jesus kept saying that He was telling them
the truth (vv.34,40,45-46,51). Some believed Him, but others remained
angry at Him and unconvinced.

In a sense, that debate goes on today. Those who oppose Jesus seek to
discredit His statements and twist them into lies. Jesus says, “I am
telling you the truth,” and promises that He will give us a freedom we
can find nowhere else.

The Bible record of Jesus’ life is worth “fact checking” as we
determine who we will follow. All of us have a choice to make.

Reflect & Pray

Faith is believing, the promise is true, Trusting in Jesus your
strength to renew; Resting so sweetly, secure on His Word, Shielded
from danger with Jesus the Lord. — Teasley

God’s truth stands any test.
