World’s Fastest Walkers

She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard
His word. —
Luke 10:39

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 10:38-42

According to a study measuring the pace of life of cities in 32
countries, people in the biggest hurry live here in Singapore. We walk
60 feet in 10:55 seconds, compared to 12:00 seconds for New Yorkers
and 31:60 seconds for those living in the African city of Blantyre,
Malawi.

But regardless of where you live, the study shows that walking speeds
have increased by an average of 10 percent in the past 20 years. And
if walking speed is any indicator for the pace of life, we are
certainly much busier than before.

Are you caught up in the frenzy of a busy life? Pause and consider
Jesus’ words to Martha: “You are worried and troubled about many
things. But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part,
which will not be taken away from her” (Luke 10:41-42).

Notice Jesus’ gentle words. He didn’t rebuke Martha for wanting to be
a good host but rather reminded her about her priorities. Martha had
allowed the necessary to get out of proportion. And, in the process,
she was so busy doing good that she didn’t take time to sit at Jesus’
feet.

In our drive to be productive for the Lord, let’s remember the one
thing worth being concerned about—enjoying time with our Savior.
