How To Enjoy Things

As for every man . . . to receive his heritage and rejoice in his
labor—this is the gift of God. —
Ecclesiastes 5:19

Today's Scripture: Ecclesiastes 5:13-20

In his book Daring To Draw Near, Dr. John White writes that several
years earlier God had made it possible for him to acquire a lovely
home with many luxuries. His feelings about the house fluctuated
dramatically.

When he reminded himself that it was a gracious gift from God, he felt
joy and thanksgiving. But when he would begin to compare it with those
of his friends, he would feel proud because he had such a fine house
and his joy would evaporate. His home would actually become a burden.
All he could see were the many hedges and trees to care for and the
endless odd jobs to do. White said, “While vanity clouds my eyes and
burdens my heart, gratitude clears my vision and lightens my load.”

The writer of Ecclesiastes saw God at every turn in the enjoyment of
material things. The power to eat the fruits of our labors and even
the strength to receive and rejoice in them is from Him (5:18-19).

From beginning to end, all of life is a continuous gift-giving by God.
We deserve nothing. He owes us nothing. Yet He gives us everything. If
we remember this, we need not feel selfish or guilty. Whatever
material blessings we have are a gift from our gracious God.
