I’m Stumped

I am afraid that . . . your minds may somehow be led astray from your
sincere and pure devotion to Christ. —
2 Corinthians 11:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 30:1-4

The riddle stumped me: What is greater than God—and more evil than the
devil? The poor have it. The rich need it. And if you eat it you will
die.

I missed the solution by allowing my mind to be distracted from the
obvious answer: “Nothing.”

That riddle reminds me of another test of wits that would have been
far more difficult to solve when it was originally posed. An ancient
wise man named Agur asked: “Who has ascended into heaven, or
descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the
waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is His name, and what is His Son’s name, if you know?” (Prov.
30:4).

Today, we know the answer to those questions. But sometimes when we’re
in the middle of the questions, worries, and needs of our lives we may
lose sight of the obvious. The details of life can so easily distract
us from the One who answers the most important riddle: Who is One with
God; more powerful than the devil; the poor can have Him; the rich
need Him; and if you eat and drink from His table, you’ll never die?
Jesus Christ, the Lord.

Reflect & Pray

Father, in the details and distractions of our spiritual journey, it
is so easy to look right past You and Your Son. May we see You today
in a new and fresh way.

Focusing on God helps us to take our eyes off our circumstances.
