Fearless Love

We love because he first loved us.
1 John 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 4:7–12

For years I wore a shield of fear to protect my heart. It became an
excuse to avoid trying new things, following my dreams, and obeying
God. But fear of loss, heartache, and rejection hindered me from
developing loving relationships with God and others. Fear made me an
insecure, anxious, and jealous wife, and an overprotective, worrying
mother. As I continue learning how much God loves me, however, He’s
changing the way I relate to Him and to others. Because I know God
will care for me, I feel more secure and willing to place the needs of
others before mine.

God is love (1 John 4:7–8). Christ’s death on the cross—the ultimate
demonstration of love—displays the depth of His passion for us (vv.
9–10). Because God loves us and lives in us, we can love others based
on who He is and what He’s done (vv. 11–12).

When we receive Jesus as our Savior, He gives us His Holy Spirit (vv.
13–15). As the Spirit helps us know and rely on God’s love, He makes
us more like Jesus (vv. 16–17). Growing in trust and faith can
gradually eliminate fear, simply because we know without a doubt that
God loves us deeply and completely (vv. 18–19).

As we experience God’s personal and unconditional love for us, we grow
and can risk relating to Him and others with fearless love.
