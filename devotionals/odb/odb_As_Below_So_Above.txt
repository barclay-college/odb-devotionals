As Below, So Above

You are witnesses of these things. . . . but tarry in the city . . .
until you are endued with power from on high. —
Luke 24:48-49

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 24:44-53

The Roman paganism of Jesus’ day taught that the actions of gods in
the heavens above affected the earth below. If Zeus got angry,
thunderbolts shot out. “As above, so below,” went the ancient formula.

Jesus, though, sometimes inverted that. He taught: As below, so above.
A believer prays, and heaven responds. A sinner repents, and the
angels rejoice. A mission succeeds, and God is glorified. A believer
rebels, and the Holy Spirit is grieved.

I believe these things, yet somehow I keep forgetting them. I forget
that my prayers matter to God. I forget that the choices I make today
bring delight or grief to the Lord of the universe. I forget that I am
helping my neighbors to their eternal destinations.

The good-news message of God’s love that Jesus brought to this earth
we can now bring to others. That was the challenge He gave His
disciples before ascending to His Father (see Matt. 28:18-20). We who
follow Jesus serve as an extension of His incarnation and ministry. It
is why He came to earth. Before He left, He told His disciples that He
would send His Spirit from above to them below (Luke 24:48). He did
not leave us alone. He fills us with His power that we might touch
lives here below to affect eternity.
