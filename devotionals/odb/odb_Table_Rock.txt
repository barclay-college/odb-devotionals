Table Rock

“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?”
Luke 6:46

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 6:46–49

A large, illuminated cross stands erect on Table Rock, a rocky plateau
overlooking my hometown. Several homes were built on neighboring land,
but recently the owners have been forced to move out due to safety
concerns. Despite their close proximity to the firm bedrock of Table
Rock, these homes aren’t secure. They have been shifting atop their
foundations—nearly three inches every day—causing risk of major water
pipes breaking, which would accelerate the sliding.

Jesus compares those who hear and obey His words to those who build
their homes on rock (Luke 6:47–48). These homes survive the storms. By
contrast, He says homes built without a firm foundation—like people
who don’t heed His instruction—cannot weather the torrents.

On many occasions, I’ve been tempted to ignore my conscience when I
knew God asked more of me than I had given, thinking my response had
been “close enough.” Yet the homes in the shifting foothills nearby
have depicted for me that being “close” is nowhere near enough when it
comes to obeying Him. To be like those who built their homes on a firm
foundation and withstand the storms of life that so often assail us,
we must heed the words of our Lord completely.

Reflect & Pray

Help me, Lord, to obey You fully and with my whole heart. Thank You
for being my firm foundation.

God’s Word is the only sure foundation for life.
