The Ease of Ingratitude

Since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be
thankful.
Hebrews 12:28

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 12:18-29

Thwip, thwap. Thwip, thwap.

The windshield wipers slamming back and forth trying to keep up with
the pelting rain only added to my irritation as I adjusted to driving
the used car I had just purchased—an old station wagon with 80,000+
miles and no side-impact airbag protection for the kids.

To get this station wagon, and some badly needed cash for groceries, I
had sold the last “treasure” we owned: a 1992 Volvo station wagon with
side-impact airbag protection for the kids. By then, everything else
was gone. Our house and our savings had all disappeared under the
weight of uncovered medical expenses from life-threatening illnesses.

“Okay, God,” I actually said out loud, “now I can’t even protect my
kids from side-impact crashes. If anything happens to them, let me
tell You what I’m going to do . . .”

Thwip, thwap. Thwip, thwap. (Gulp.)

I was instantly ashamed. In the previous 2 years God had spared both
my wife and my son from almost certain death, and yet here I was
whining about “things” I had lost. Just like that I’d learned how
quickly I could grow ungrateful to God. The loving Father, who did not
spare His own Son so I could be saved, had actually spared my son in a
miraculous fashion.

“Forgive me, Father,” I prayed. Already done, My child.

Reflect & Pray

How easy it is, Lord, to let the trials of the moment strip us of the
memory of Your protection and provision. Praise You, Father, for Your
patience and Your unending, unconditional love.

Thankfulness is the soil in which joy thrives.
