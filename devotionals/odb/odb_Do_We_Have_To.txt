Do We Have To?

Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
Luke 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:12–28

Joie started the children’s program with prayer, then sang with the
kids. Six-year-old Emmanuel squirmed in his seat when she prayed again
after introducing Aaron, the teacher. Then Aaron began and ended his
talk with prayer. Emmanuel complained: “That’s four prayers! I can’t
sit still that long!”

If you think Emmanuel’s challenge is difficult, look at 1
Thessalonians 5:17: “Pray continually” or always be in a spirit of
prayer. Even some of us adults can find prayer to be boring. Maybe
that’s because we don’t know what to say or don’t understand that
prayer is a conversation with our Father.

Back in the seventeenth century, François Fénelon wrote some words
about prayer that have helped me: “Tell God all that is in your heart,
as one unloads one’s heart, its pleasures and its pains, to a dear
friend. Tell Him your troubles, that He may comfort you; tell Him your
joys, that He may sober them; tell Him your longings, that He may
purify them.” He continued, “Talk to Him of your temptations, that He
may shield you from them: show Him the wounds of your heart, that He
may heal them . . . . If you thus pour out all your weaknesses, needs,
troubles, there will be no lack of what to say.”

May we grow in our intimacy with God so that we will want to spend
more time with Him.

Reflect & Pray

For further study, read about Jesus’s example of prayer in John 17 and
Luke 5:16.

Prayer is an intimate conversation with our God.
