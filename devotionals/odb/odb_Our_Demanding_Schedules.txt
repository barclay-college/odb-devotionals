Our Demanding Schedules

The whole city was gathered together at the door. Then He healed many.

Mark 1:33-34

Today's Scripture: Mark 1:32-39

Is your life too busy? Business deadlines, productivity quotas, and
shuttling children to lessons and sporting events can really fill up
your schedule. It’s easy to think, If only I didn’t have so many
responsibilities, then I could walk in vital union with God.

Yet C. S. Lewis wisely points out that no one was busier than Christ.
“Our model is the Jesus . . . of the workshop, the roads, the crowds,
the clamorous demands and surly oppositions, the lack of all peace and
privacy, the interruptions. For this . . . is the Divine life
operating under human conditions.”

We read of Jesus in Capernaum: “At evening, when the sun had set, they
brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.
And the whole city was gathered together at the door. Then He healed
many” (Mark 1:32-34). The next day Christ sought out a solitary place
and prayed. There He received direction from His Father to pursue a
demanding ministry in another place. Our Lord communed with His Father
and depended on the Spirit to minister through Him.

Is your schedule demanding? Follow the example of Jesus and set aside
a specific time for prayer. Then depend upon God’s power to help you
meet each day’s demands.
