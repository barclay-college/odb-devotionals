A Work In Progress

Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. —
2 Peter 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 15:9-17

Pablo Casals was considered to be the preeminent cellist of the first
half of the 20th century. When he was still playing his cello in the
middle of his tenth decade of life, a young reporter asked, “Mr.
Casals, you are 95 years old and the greatest cellist that ever lived.
Why do you still practice 6 hours a day?”

Mr. Casals answered, “Because I think I’m making progress.”

What a great attitude! As believers in Christ, we should never be
satisfied to think we have reached some self-proclaimed pinnacle of
spiritual success, but rather continue to “grow in the grace and
knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 3:18). Jesus
reminds us in John 15:16 that He chose us to “go and bear fruit.” The
result of healthy growth is continuing to bear spiritual fruit
throughout our lives. Our Lord promises: “I am the vine, you are the
branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit” (v.5).

In a steady and faithful progression to become more and more like the
One we love and serve, we can be confident that He who began “a good
work” in us will continue it until it is finally finished on the day
when He returns (Phil. 1:6).

Reflect & Pray

Closer yet I’d cling, my Savior, You’re the all-sufficient Vine; You
alone can make me fruitful, Blessed source of strength divine. —Bosch

God’s unseen work in our hearts produces fruit in our lives.
