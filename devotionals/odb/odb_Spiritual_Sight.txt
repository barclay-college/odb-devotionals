Spiritual Sight

In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of His grace. —
Ephesians 1:7

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 1:15-21

A prisoner who survived 14 years in a Cuban jail told how he kept his
spirits up and his hope alive: “I had no window in my cell, and so I
mentally constructed one on the door. I ‘saw’ in my mind a beautiful
scene from the mountains, with water tumbling down a ravine over
rocks. It became so real to me that I would visualize it without
effort every time I looked at the cell door.”

Ironically, some of the most hopeful books of the Bible—Philippians,
Colossians, and Ephesians—come out of Paul’s house arrest in Rome. The
letter to the Ephesians gives a hint as to what the apostle Paul saw
when he thought about life beyond his place of confinement.

First he saw the spiritual growth in the churches he left behind. This
book opens with a burst of thanksgiving for the vitality of the
Ephesian church (Eph. 1:15-16). Then he sought to open the eyes of
their hearts to even more exalted sights: the “exceeding riches” of
God’s grace (2:7). When Paul cranks up the volume to express God’s
plan of love, not one low, mournful note sneaks in.

If you feel discouraged or question whether the Christian life is
worth it, Ephesians proves to be a great tonic. It prescribes the
riches in Christ available to all.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, thank You for the staggering good news of the riches
of Your infinite grace. Thank You for the encouragement and hope we
find in Ephesians. Amen.

No one is hopeless whose hope is in God and His Word.
