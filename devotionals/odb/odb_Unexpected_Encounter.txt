Unexpected Encounter

The Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the Lord
God of Israel. —
Ruth 2:12

Today's Scripture: Ruth 2:11-20

Drew, young and enthusiastic, was leading the singing for the first
time in a large church. Lois, a long-time attender, wanted to
encourage him, but she thought it would be too difficult to get to the
front of the church before he left. But then she saw a way to snake
through the crowd. Lois told Drew, “I appreciate your enthusiasm in
worship. Keep serving Him!”

As Lois walked away, she ran into Sharon, who she hadn’t seen in
months. After a short conversation, Sharon said, “Thank you for what
you do for the Lord. Keep serving Him!” Because Lois had gone out of
her way to give encouragement, she was now in the right place to
receive unexpected encouragement.

After Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi, left Moab and returned to
Israel, they received an unexpected blessing. They were both widows
with no one to provide for them, so Ruth went to glean grain from a
field (Ruth 2:2-3). The field happened to be owned by Boaz, a distant
relative of Naomi’s. He noticed Ruth, provided for her needs, and
later became her husband (2:20; 4:13). Ruth received a blessing
because she was in the right place at the right time (2:11-23).

Sometimes God uses unexpected encounters to bring unexpected
blessings.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me to go out of my way to encourage others—whether or
not I receive anything in return. My heart’s desire is to help others
along the way to know You. May I be Your hands and feet.

When it comes to helping others, don’t stop at nothing.
