Unfailing Love

Your unfailing love is better than life itself; how I praise you!
Psalm 63:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Lamentations 3:21–26

On a recent airline flight the landing was a little rough, jostling us
left and right down the runway. Some of the passengers were visibly
nervous, but the tension broke when two little girls sitting behind me
cheered, “Yeah! Let’s do that again!”

Children are open to new adventures and see life with humble, wide-
eyed wonder. Perhaps this is part of what Jesus had in mind when He
said that we have to “receive the kingdom of God like a little child”
(Mark 10:15).

Life has its challenges and heartaches. Few knew this better than
Jeremiah, who is also called “the weeping prophet.” But in the middle
of Jeremiah’s troubles, God encouraged him with an amazing truth: “The
faithful love of the Lord never ends! His mercies never cease. Great
is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each morning” (Lam.
3:22–23 nlt).

God’s fresh mercies can break into our lives at any moment. They are
always there, and we see them when we live with childlike
expectation—watching and waiting for what only He can do. Jeremiah
knew that God’s goodness is not defined only by our immediate
circumstances and that His faithfulness is greater than life’s rough
places. Look for God’s fresh mercies today.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please help me to have the faith of a child so that I can live
with expectation, always looking forward to what You will do next.

God is greater than anything that happens to us.
