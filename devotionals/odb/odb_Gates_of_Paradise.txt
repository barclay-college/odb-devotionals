Gates of Paradise

I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.
John 10:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 10:1-9

Italian artist Lorenzo Ghiberti (1378–1455) spent years skillfully
crafting images of Jesus’ life into the bronze doors of Italy’s
Florence Baptistery. These bronze reliefs were so moving that
Michelangelo called them the Gates of Paradise.

As an artistic treasure, the doors greet visitors with echoes of the
gospel story. It was Jesus who said, “I am the gate; whoever enters
through me will be saved” (John 10:9). On the night before His
crucifixion, He told His disciples, “I am the way and the truth and
the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (14:6). Within
a few hours Jesus would say to one of the criminals being crucified at
His side, “Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43).

The apostle Peter a few weeks later boldly proclaimed to those who had
called for Jesus’ death that “there is no other name under heaven . .
. by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). Years later, the apostle
Paul wrote that there is only one mediator between God and
humanity—the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. 2:5).

The gates of paradise are found in the Savior who offers everlasting
life to all who believe and come to Him. Enter into the joy of His
salvation.

Reflect & Pray

I needed a mediator because of my sin. Thank You, Jesus, for being the
way to the Father by Your death and resurrection. I will be forever
grateful.

Jesus died in our place to give us His peace.
