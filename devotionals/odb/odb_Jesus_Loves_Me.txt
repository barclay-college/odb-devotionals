Jesus Loves Me

Keep yourselves in the love of God. —
Jude 1:21

Today's Scripture: Romans 8:31-39

On cold days, our old dog moves around the yard, finding a sunny spot
to stretch out on the grass to keep herself in the warmth of the sun.

This reminds me that we must “keep” ourselves in the love of God (Jude
1:21). That doesn’t mean we have to act in some special way to make
God love us (although our desire is to please Him). Because we are His
children we’re loved no matter what we do or fail to do. It means
instead that we should think about His love and bask in its radiance
and warmth all day long.

“[Nothing] shall be able to separate us from the love of God” (Rom.
8:39). He loved us before we were born, and He loves us now. This is
our identity in Christ; it is who we are—God’s beloved children.
That’s something to think about throughout the day.

Five times in John’s gospel he described himself as the disciple Jesus
loved (13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7,20). Jesus loved His other disciples
too, but John reveled in the fact that Jesus loved him! We can adopt
John’s theme—“I am the disciple Jesus loves!”—and repeat it to
ourselves all day long. Or we can sing that familiar children’s song
in our hearts, “Jesus loves me, this I know.” As we carry that truth
with us throughout the day, we’ll bask in the warmth of His love!

Reflect & Pray

I am so glad that our Father in heaven Tells of His love in the Book
He has given; Wonderful things in the Bible I see— This is the
dearest, that Jesus loves me. —Bliss

God loves us not because of who we are, but because of who He is.
