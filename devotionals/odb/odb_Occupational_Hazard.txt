Occupational Hazard

The things which happened to me have actually turned out for the
furtherance of the gospel. —
Philippians 1:12

Today's Scripture: Philippians 1:12-18

My occupation is words. Whether I am writing or editing, I am using
words to convey ideas so that readers can understand. I can usually
see what’s wrong with someone else’s writing (though sometimes not
with my own) and figure out how to fix it.

As an editor, I am paid for being critical. My job is to see what’s
wrong with the way words are used. This ability becomes a disability
when I carry it over into my personal life and always look for what is
wrong. Focusing on what’s wrong can cause us to miss everything that’s
good.

The apostle Paul had reason to focus on what was wrong in the
Philippian church. Certain people were preaching the gospel out of
selfish ambition to add to Paul’s suffering (Phil. 1:16). But instead
of concentrating on the negative, he chose to look at the positive and
rejoice in it: Jesus Christ was being preached (v.18).

God wants us to be discerning—we need to know good from bad—but He
doesn’t want us to focus on the bad and become critical or
discouraged. Even in circumstances that are less than ideal (Paul was
writing from prison), we can find something good because in times of
trouble God is still at work.

Reflect & Pray

The eyes of faith when fixed on Christ Give hope for what’s ahead, But
focus on life’s obstacles And faith gives way to dread. —D. De Haan

When your outlook is blurred by problems, focus on Christ.
