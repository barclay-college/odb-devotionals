Flowing Peace

Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you.
John 14:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:16-27

“I’m not surprised you lead retreats,” said an acquaintance in my
exercise class. “You have a good aura.” I was jolted but pleased by
her comment, because I realized that what she saw as an “aura” in me,
I understood to be the peace of Christ. As we follow Jesus, He gives
us the peace that transcends understanding (Phil. 4:7) and radiates
from within—though we may not even be aware of it.

Jesus promised His followers this peace when, after their last supper
together, He prepared them for His death and resurrection. He told
them that though they would have trouble in the world, the Father
would send them the Spirit of truth to live with them and be in them
(John 14:16-17). The Spirit would teach them, bringing to mind His
truths; the Spirit would comfort them, bestowing on them His peace.
Though soon they would face trials—including fierce opposition from
the religious leaders and seeing Jesus executed—He told them not to be
afraid. The Holy Spirit’s presence would never leave them.

Although as God’s children we experience hardship, we too have His
Spirit living within and flowing out of us. God’s peace can be His
witness to everyone we meet—whether at a local market, at school or
work, or in the gym.

Reflect & Pray

Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, thank You for welcoming me into Your
circle of love. May I share Your peace with someone in my community
today.

When we keep our mind on God, His Spirit keeps our mind at peace.
