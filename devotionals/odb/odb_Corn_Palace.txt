Corn Palace

Some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and
devoured it. —
Mark 4:4

Today's Scripture: Mark 4:1-20

The walls of the Mitchell Corn Palace exhibit beautiful murals every
year. Scenes include birds in flight, Conestoga wagons heading West,
Native American teepees, and rural settings. There is one peculiarity
about these murals though—they are made out of corn, seeds, and
grasses. The outside murals are replaced each year with a new theme,
partly because hungry birds eat from them.

Jesus told a parable about birds and seeds: “Listen! Behold, a sower
went out to sow. And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell by
the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it” (Mark
4:3-4). Other seed fell among rocky soil and thorns, making them
unfruitful (vv.5-7). But some fell on good ground and yielded an
abundant crop (v.8).

Jesus explained that when people by the wayside hear God’s Word,
“Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in
their hearts” (v.15). The devil hates the gospel and seeks to prevent
people from believing it. Often he subtly encourages hearers to
procrastinate on making a decision or to forget what they have heard.
To counter this, in our witnessing we should pray that the Lord of the
harvest will cause the Word to take root in receptive hearts.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, please use Your Word to touch the hearts of those with whom we
share it. We know that You are the One who opens the eyes of the
spiritually blind. Don’t let Satan’s schemes win out.

We plant the seed; God gives the harvest.
