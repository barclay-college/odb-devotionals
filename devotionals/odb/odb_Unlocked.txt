Unlocked

Once you were alienated from God . . . . But now he has reconciled
you.
Colossians 1:21–22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 1:13–23

A boy born with cerebral palsy was unable to speak or communicate. But
his mother, Chantal Bryan, never gave up, and when he was ten years
old she figured out how to communicate with him through his eyes and a
letter board. After this breakthrough, she said, “He was unlocked and
we could ask him anything.” Now Jonathan reads and writes, including
poetry, by communicating through his eyes. When asked what it’s like
to “talk” with his family and friends, he said, “It is wonderful to
tell them I love them.”

Jonathan’s story is profoundly moving and leads me to consider how God
unlocks us from the prison of sin. As the apostle Paul wrote to the
Christians at Colossae, once we were “alienated from God” (Colossians
1:21), our evil behavior making us His enemy, but through Christ’s
death on the cross we are now presented to God as “holy in his sight”
(v. 22). We may now “live a life worthy of the Lord” as we bear fruit,
grow in the knowledge of God, and are strengthened in His power (vv.
10–11).

We can use our unlocked voices to praise God and share His good news
that we are no longer bound to a life of sin. As we continue in our
faith, we can hold firm to our hope in Christ.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, You have released us from our chains of unbelief and given
us words to praise You. May we share this freedom with others for Your
glory.

The Lord unlocks us from our prison of sin.
