Light in the Darkness

I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me
should not abide in darkness.
John 12:46

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 12:42-50

During a trip to Peru, I visited one of the many caves found
throughout that mountainous country. Our guide told us that this
particular cave had already been explored to a depth of 9 miles—and it
went even deeper. We saw fascinating bats, nocturnal birds, and
interesting rock formations. Before long, however, the darkness of the
cave became unnerving—almost suffocating. I was greatly relieved when
we returned to the surface and the light of day.

That experience was a stark reminder of how oppressive darkness can be
and how much we need light. We live in a world made dark by sin—a
world that has turned against its Creator. And we need the Light.

Jesus, who came to restore all of creation—including humanity—to its
intended place referred to Himself as that “light” (John 8:12).  “I
have come as a light into the world,” He said, “that whoever believes
in Me should not abide in darkness” (12:46).

In Him, we not only have the light of salvation but the only light by
which we can find our way—His way—through our world’s spiritual
darkness.
