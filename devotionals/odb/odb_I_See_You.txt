I See You

I have now seen the One who sees me.
Genesis 16:13

Today's Scripture: Genesis 16:1–13

“I see you,” a friend said in an online writers’ group where we
support and encourage each other. Having felt stressed and anxious, I
experienced a sense of peace and well-being with her words. She “saw”
me—my hopes, fears, struggles, and dreams—and loved me.

When I heard my friend’s simple but powerful encouragement, I thought
of Hagar, a slave in Abram’s household. After many years of Sarai and
Abram still longing for an heir, Sarai followed the custom of the
culture and told her husband to conceive through Hagar. But when Hagar
became pregnant, she treated Sarai with contempt. When Sarai
mistreated her in return, Hagar fled far away to the desert.

The Lord saw Hagar in her pain and confusion, and He blessed her with
the promise that she would be the mother of many descendants. After
the encounter, Hagar called the Lord “El Roi,” which means “the God
who sees me” (Gen. 16:13), for she knew she wasn’t alone or abandoned.

As Hagar was seen—and loved—so are we. We might feel ignored or
rejected by friends or family, yet we know that our Father sees not
only the face we present to the world, but all of our secret feelings
and fears. He speaks the words that bring us life.

Reflect & Pray

Father God, just as You saw Hagar in her distress, so You see those
who are hurting, fleeing oppression, and afraid. Please send them help
and encouragement.

To know that God sees us gives us comfort and confidence.
