Cupbearer To The King

Why is your face sad? . . . What do you request? —
Nehemiah 2:2

Today's Scripture: Nehemiah 2:1-8

One of my favorite Bible passages that applies to work is Nehemiah
1–2. King Artaxerxes’ employee Nehemiah had been such an exemplary
worker that the king wanted to honor him by helping him when he was
sad that Jerusalem was still in ruins. He asked Nehemiah, “Why is your
face sad? . . . What do you request?” (2:2,4). He wasn’t just any
worker for the king, he was the cupbearer, the man who tasted the
king’s drink to protect him from being poisoned. In order to have
earned such a position, he apparently worked hard and honored God in
everything he did. And the king granted his requests.

God cares about the way we work. Colossians 3:23 tells us, “Whatever
you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.” We can follow
Nehemiah’s example in these ways: Be such a competent and trusted
worker that God is honored (Neh. 1:11–2:6). Care passionately about
others and what’s important to them. Take action, occasionally even
risky action, to honor what’s important to God and to fellow believers
(2:3-6).

When we honor God in work, our employers may notice. But even if they
don’t, our heart’s desire and purpose should be to honor the One we
really serve—the Lord our God (Col. 3:17,23).

Reflect & Pray

O Lord, may the way I serve tell Your story! I want to bring You all
the glory in my work, at home, and everywhere I go. Fill me and use me
to bless others and honor You today.

God honors faith because faith honors God.
