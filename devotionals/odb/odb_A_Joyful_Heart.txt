A Joyful Heart

Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
Psalm 100:1

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 7:1–10

My granddaughter’s favorite tune is one of John Philip Sousa’s
marches. Sousa, known as “The March King,” was a US composer in the
late nineteenth century. Moriah isn’t in a marching band; she’s only
twenty months old. She just loves the tune and can even hum a few
notes. She associates it with joyful times. When our family gets
together, we often hum this song along with claps and other boisterous
noises, and the grandchildren dance or parade in circles to the beat.
It always ends in dizzy children and lots of laughter.

Our joyful noise reminds me of the psalm that implores us to “worship
the Lord with gladness” (Ps. 100:2). When King Solomon dedicated the
temple, the Israelites celebrated with praises (2 Chron. 7:5–6). Psalm
100 may have been one of the songs they sang. The psalm declares:
“Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth. Worship the Lord with
gladness; come before him with joyful songs. . . . Enter his gates
with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and
praise his name” (vv. 1-2, 4). Why? “For the Lord is good and his love
endures forever”! (v. 5).

Our good God loves us! In grateful response, let’s “shout for joy to
the Lord”! (Ps. 100:1).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, give us thankful hearts to praise You, because You are good
and all that You do is good. Your love endures forever!

Praise is the overflow of a joyful heart.
