But a Breath

My hope is in you.
Psalm 39:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 39:1–13

Bobby’s sudden death brought home to me the stark reality of death and
the brevity of life. My childhood friend was only twenty-four when a
tragic accident on an icy road claimed her life. Growing up in a
dysfunctional family, she had recently seemed to be moving forward.
Just a new believer in Jesus, how could her life end so soon?

Sometimes life seems far too short and full of sorrow. In Psalm 39 the
psalmist David bemoans his own suffering and exclaims: “Show me, Lord
, my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my
life is. You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my
years is as nothing before you. Everyone is but a breath, even those
who seem secure” (vv. 4–5). Life is short. Even if we live to see a
century, our earthly life is but a drop in all of time.

And yet, with David, we can say, “My hope is in [the Lord]” (v. 7). We
can trust that our lives do have meaning. Though our bodies waste
away, as believers we have confidence that “inwardly we are being
renewed day by day”—and one day we’ll enjoy eternal life with Him (2
Corinthians 4:16–5:1). We know this because God “has given us the
Spirit . . . guaranteeing what is to come”! (5:5).

Reflect & Pray

How is it comforting to know that God has made it possible for you to
share in His eternal life? How can the gift of each moment encourage
you to make the most of your time?

Thank You, Lord, that this life is not all there is! You have eternity
in store for all who believe in You. Help us to spend our numbered
days here in service to You.
