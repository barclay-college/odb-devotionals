Open-Handed Help

You shall open your hand wide to [the poor]. —
Deuteronomy 15:8

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 15:7-11

A homeless man spends time in our local library. One afternoon, while
I was writing there, I took a lunch break. After I finished the first
half of a turkey and Swiss cheese sandwich, an image of the man’s face
came to mind. A few minutes later, I offered him the untouched part of
my lunch. He accepted.

This brief encounter made me realize that with all that God has given
me, I needed to do more to help those who are less fortunate. Later,
as I thought about this, I read Moses’ instructions on providing for
the poor. He told the Israelites: Do not “shut your hand from your
poor brother, but . . . open your hand wide to him” (Deut. 15:7-8). An
open hand symbolizes the way God wanted His nation to provide for
impoverished people—willingly and freely. No excuses, no holding back
(v.9). God had given to them, and He wanted them to give generously
enough to supply whatever was “sufficient” for the need (v.8).

When we offer open-handed help to the poor, God blesses us for our
kindness (Ps. 41:1-3; Prov. 19:17). With His leading, consider how you
might “extend your soul to the hungry” (Isa. 58:10) and freely give to
help others in Jesus’ name.

Reflect & Pray

Grant us, then, the grace for giving With a spirit large and free,
That our life and all our living We may consecrate to Thee. —Murray

You may give without loving, but you can’t love without giving.
