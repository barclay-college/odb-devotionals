Shout Of Triumph

It is finished! —
John 19:30

Today's Scripture: John 19:28-37

Recently I read about Aron Ralston, a hiker who was trapped alone at
the bottom of a remote canyon. With scant hope of being found and his
strength ebbing away, he had to take drastic measures to save his
life. During a moment of excruciating pain, he shouted in agony and in
victory, because he had freed himself and now had a chance to escape
and live.

Those who witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus saw His hours of agony
and heard Him cry out in a loud voice, “It is finished!” as He gave up
His spirit (John 19:30). His final words from the cross were not a cry
of painful defeat but a shout of triumph, because He had accomplished
all that the Father sent Him to do.

When Jesus died, He shared in what all of us must experience. But far
beyond that, He did what none of us can do. He paid the price for our
sins that we might be forgiven and have eternal life through faith in
Him.

“It is finished!” was the Lord’s shout of victory because now, through
Him, we can escape the power of sin; we can live and be free.

Because of Jesus’ sacrifice for us, we call the day of His death Good
Friday.
