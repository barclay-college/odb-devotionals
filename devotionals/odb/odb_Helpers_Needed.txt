Helpers Needed

The Helper, the Holy Spirit, . . . will teach you all things. —
John 14:26

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 16:1-16

To some people, the term helper carries with it second-class
connotations. Classroom helpers assist trained teachers in their
classes. Helpers assist trained electricians, plumbers, and lawyers on
the job. Because they aren’t as skilled in the profession, they might
be viewed as having less value. But everyone is needed to accomplish
the task.

The apostle Paul had many helpers in his work of ministry. He listed
them in his letter to Rome (ch.16). He made special reference to
Phoebe, who “has been a helper of many and of myself also” (v.2).
Priscilla and Aquila risked their own lives for Paul (vv.3-4). And
Mary, Paul said, “labored much for us” (v.6).

Helping is a spiritual gift, according to 1 Corinthians 12:28. Paul
listed it among the gifts from the Holy Spirit that are given to
believers in Christ’s body, the church. The gift of “helps” is just as
needed as the others that are listed.

Even the Holy Spirit is called a “Helper.” Jesus said, “The Helper,
the Holy Spirit, . . . will teach you all things, and bring to your
remembrance all things that I said to you” (John 14:26).

In whatever ways the Holy Spirit, the Helper, has gifted you, let Him
use you for His honor.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for the gifts You have given me so that I might
serve the body of Christ. Help me to be faithful to use my gifts to
bring You glory.

You are a necessary part of the whole.
