Breaking Free

There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ
Jesus. —
Romans 8:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:1-11

The elephant is the largest land animal on earth—and one of the most
powerful. Yet it takes only a strong rope to restrain one. Here’s how
it works. When the elephant is young, he is tied to a large tree. For
weeks, he will strain and pull, but the rope holds him fast. So
eventually he gives up.

Then, when the elephant reaches his full size and strength, he won’t
struggle to get free, for once he feels resistance, he stops. He still
believes he’s held captive and can’t break free.

Satan can play a similar trick on us to hold us captive. The Bible
assures us that there is “no condemnation to those who are in Christ
Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the
Spirit” (Rom. 8:1). We have been set “free from the law of sin and
death” (v.2). But the enemy of our soul tries to make us believe we
are still dominated by sin.

What shall we do then? Reflect on what Christ has done. He died for
our sins and declared an end to sin’s control over us (v.3). He rose
from the dead and gave us the Holy Spirit. Now we are empowered to
live victoriously in Him because “the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus
from the dead dwells in [us]” (v.11).

In Christ, we are set free.

Reflect & Pray

He has our salvation wrought, He our captive souls has bought, He has
reconciled to God, He has washed us in His blood. —Wesley

Experience true freedom— take every thought captive in obedience to
Christ.
