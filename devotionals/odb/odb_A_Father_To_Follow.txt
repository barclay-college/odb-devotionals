A Father To Follow

[Jehoshaphat] sought the God of his father, and walked in His
commandments. —
2 Chronicles 17:4

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 17:1-10

When I think of my father, I think of this saying: “He didn’t tell me
how to live; he lived, and he let me watch him do it.” During my
youth, I watched my dad walk with God. He participated in Sunday
morning church services, taught an adult Bible-study class, helped
with counting the offering, and served as a deacon. Outside of church,
he faithfully defended the gospel and read his Bible. I saw him
express his love for the Lord through outward actions.

Asa, king of Judah, modeled devotion to God for a season in his life
(2 Chron. 14:2). He removed the idols from his kingdom, restored the
altar of the Lord, and led the people into a covenant with God
(15:8-12). Asa’s son Jehoshaphat carried on this legacy by seeking
“the God of his father and walk[ing] in His commandments” (17:4).
Jehoshaphat purged the land of idol worship (v.6) and sent out priests
and Levites to teach God’s law in all of the cities of Judah (vv.7-9).

Jehoshaphat’s reign resembled that of his father; he faithfully
honored Asa’s godly example. Yet even more important, Jehoshaphat’s
“heart took delight in the ways of the Lord” (v.6). Today, if you’re
looking for a father to follow, remember your heavenly Father and take
delight in His ways.
