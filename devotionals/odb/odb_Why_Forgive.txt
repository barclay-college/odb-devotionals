Why Forgive?

Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are
doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
Luke 23:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 23:32–34

When a friend betrayed me, I knew I would need to forgive her, but I
wasn’t sure that I could. Her words pierced deeply inside me, and I
felt stunned with pain and anger. Although we talked about it and I
told her I forgave her, for a long time whenever I’d see her I felt
tinges of hurt, so I knew I still clung to some resentment. One day,
however, God answered my prayers and gave me the ability to let go
completely. I was finally free.

Forgiveness lies at the heart of the Christian faith, with our Savior
extending forgiveness even when He was dying on the cross. Jesus loved
those who had nailed Him there, uttering a prayer asking His Father to
forgive them. He didn’t hang on to bitterness or anger, but showed
grace and love to those who had wronged Him.

This is a fitting time to consider before the Lord any people we might
need to forgive as we follow Jesus’s example in extending His love to
those who hurt us. When we ask God through His Spirit to help us
forgive, He will come to our aid—even if we take what we think is a
long time to forgive. When we do, we are freed from the prison of
unforgiveness.
