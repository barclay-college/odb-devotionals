The Joy Of Remembering

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits. —
Psalm 103:2

Today's Scripture: Psalm 103:1-14

A long-time friend described the days surrounding his 90th birthday as
“a time . . . to do a little reflecting, looking in the rearview
mirror of my life, and spending many hours in what I call ‘The Grace
of Remembrance.’ It’s so easy to forget all the ways that the Lord has
led! ‘Forget not all His benefits’” (Ps. 103:2).

This was typical of the person I’ve known and admired for more than 50
years. Rather than reviewing disappointments, his letter was filled
with thankfulness and praise to God.

First, he recalled the Lord’s temporal mercies—his good health, the
enjoyment of his wife and children, the joy and success of work, his
enriching friendships, and the opportunities he’d had to serve God. He
considered them all gifts—none deserved, but all gratefully received.

Next, he reviewed God’s spiritual mercies—the influence of Christian
parents and the experience of God’s forgiveness when he accepted
Christ as a teenager. He concluded with the encouragement he’d
received from churches, schools, and Christian men who cared and
prayed for each other.

It’s a model we should follow on a regular basis—the joy of
remembering. “Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me,
bless His holy name!” (v.1).

Reflect & Pray

He knoweth best! His will for me Is better than my plans. Do not all
good and perfect gifts Come from my Father’s hand? —Doonan

Give loving thanks for the Lord’s lavish gifts.
