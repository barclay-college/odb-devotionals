Out Of Chaos

Speak evil of no one, . . . be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility
to all men. —
Titus 3:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 8:1-15

Everything I observe makes me believe this is true: Order is not
natural. When I consider my office, I’m astounded at how quickly it
descends into chaos and how long it takes me to restore order. Order
requires intervention; it does not happen naturally.

I shouldn’t be surprised. God’s role in bringing order out of chaos is
a prominent biblical theme. He did it when He was creating the nation
of Israel (Ex. 7–14). When God said it was time to bring the Hebrew
people out of Egypt, Pharaoh objected. His nation’s economy depended
on the Hebrew workers, so Pharaoh didn’t want to lose them. To change
Pharaoh’s mind, God sent 10 plagues to convince him. Pharaoh’s
magicians were able to duplicate the first two plagues. But they could
not reverse the plagues—any of them. They could cause chaos, but they
could not restore order. Only God can do that.

With effort, we can bring order to our living spaces, but none of us
can bring order out of the emotional and spiritual chaos of our lives.
Only God can do that. He restores order to chaotic situations when we
live as God intended—speaking no evil, being peaceable and gentle, and
showing humility to all (Titus 3:2).

Reflect & Pray

Father, our world and our lives do have much chaos and confusion. We
need You to restore our souls. Help us to live as You want us to live—
loving others.

When we put our problems in God’s hands, He puts His peace in our
hearts.
