From Worms to War

The Lord said to [Gideon], “Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going
to die.”
Judges 6:23

Today's Scripture: Judges 6:11–16, 36–40

It was ten-year-old Cleo’s first time fishing, and as he looked into
the container of bait he seemed hesitant to get started. Finally he
said to my husband, “Help me, I-S-O-W!” When my husband asked him what
the problem was, Cleo responded, “I-S-O-W! I’m scared of worms!” His
fear had made him unable to act.

Fear can paralyze grown men too. Gideon must’ve been afraid when the
angel of the Lord came to him as he was threshing wheat in secret,
hiding from his Midianite enemies (Judg. 6:11). The angel told him he
had been chosen by God to lead His people in battle (vv. 12–14).

Gideon’s response? “Pardon me, my lord, . . . but how can I save
Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my
family” (v. 15). After being assured of the Lord’s presence, Gideon
still seemed fearful and asked for signs that God would use him to
save Israel as He promised (vv. 36–40). And God responded to Gideon’s
requests. The Israelites were successful in battle and then enjoyed
peace for forty years.

We all have fears of various kinds—from worms to wars. Gideon’s story
teaches us that we can be confident of this: If God asks us to do
something, He’ll give us the strength and power to do it.
