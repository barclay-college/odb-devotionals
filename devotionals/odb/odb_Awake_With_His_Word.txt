Awake With His Word

I rise before the dawning of the morning, and cry for help; I hope in
Your Word. —
Psalm 119:147

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:145-152

My eyes fluttered open, but the room was still dark. It was too early
to get up. I sighed, adjusted my pillow, and hoped for sleep.
Unfortunately, a lengthy to-do list bombarded my brain. I needed to
buy groceries, deliver a meal to a friend, answer e-mail, schedule a
doctor’s appointment . . . .

If you’ve ever been overwhelmed and worried, you know how it feels to
stare at the ceiling when you should be sleeping. The writer of Psalm
119 was no stranger to this experience. He wrote, “I rise before the
dawning of the morning, and cry for help; I hope in Your Word”
(v.147).

God’s Word delivered special comfort during the psalmist’s sleepless
nights. Although he couldn’t make his problems disappear, he said, “My
eyes are awake through the night watches, that I may meditate on Your
Word” (v.148). At night he reviewed God’s Word over and over in his
mind. He concentrated on Scripture rather than his concerns. This
practice allowed him to proclaim, “Oh, how I love Your law!” (v.97).

When worry wakes you up, remember, “The Word of God is living and
powerful” (Heb. 4:12). Select a passage and mull it over. Our cares
cannot compete with God’s Word!

Reflect & Pray

If your soul is parched and thirsty And you feel weighed down by care,
Go to God’s Word for refreshment— You’ll find strength and comfort
there. —Sper

Only God can still our hearts and quiet our minds.
