Lasting Rewards

Bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all
things. —
1 Timothy 4:8

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 9:24-27

Ukrainian gymnast Larisa Latynina held the record of 18 Olympic
medals. She won them in the 1956, 1960, and 1964 Olympics. The
48-year-old record was surpassed when Michael Phelps swam for his 19th
gold in the 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay in the 2012 London Games.
“[Latynina] kind of got lost in history,” the publisher of the
International Gymnast magazine said. When the Soviet Union broke up,
“we had forgotten about her.”

Paul, the apostle, reminds us that sometimes hard work is forgotten.
Athletes subject their bodies to great discipline as they train to win
perishable medals for their effort (1 Cor. 9:25). But it is not just
that the medals are perishable. Over time, people’s memory of those
achievements dim and fade. If athletes can sacrifice so much to
achieve rewards on the earth, rewards that will eventually be
forgotten, how much more effort should followers of Christ exert to
gain an imperishable crown? (1 Tim. 4:8).

Athletes’ sacrifice and determination are rewarded with medals,
trophies, and money. But even greater, our Father in heaven rewards
the discipline of His children (Luke 19:17).

God will never forget our service done out of love for Him who first
loved us.

Reflect & Pray

I thank You, Lord, for the opportunities to use the gifts You have
given me for Your service today. Help me to do so in obedience,
expecting nothing more than Your “well done” as reward.

Sacrifice for the kingdom is never without reward.
