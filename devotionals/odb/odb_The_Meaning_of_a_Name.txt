The Meaning of a Name

You are to give him the name Jesus.
Matthew 1:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 1:18-25

According to a New York Times article, children in many African
countries are often named after a famous visitor, special event, or
circumstance that was meaningful to the parents. When doctors told the
parents of one child that they could not cure the infant’s illness and
only God knew if he would live, the parents named their child
Godknows. Another man said he was named Enough, because his mother had
13 children and he was the last one! There’s a reason for everyone’s
name, and in some cases it also conveys a special meaning.

Before Jesus was born, an angel of the Lord told Joseph, “[Mary] will
give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because
he will save his people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21). Jesus is the
Greek form of Joshua, which means “the Lord saves.” In that day and
culture, many children would have been named Jesus, but only one came
into this world to die so that all who receive Him might live
eternally, forgiven and freed from the power of sin.

Charles Wesley wrote these words we often sing as Christmas nears:
“Come, Thou long-expected Jesus, born to set Thy people free; from our
fears and sins release us; let us find our rest in Thee.”

Jesus came to turn our darkness into light, to transform our despair
into hope, and to save us from our sins.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, in Jesus we see Your loving purpose and boundless
grace. We humbly acknowledge Your Son as the One who came to save us
from our sins.

Jesus’ name and mission are the same—He came to save us.
