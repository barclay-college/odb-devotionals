Bringing Our Friends to Jesus

When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your
sins are forgiven.”
Mark 2:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 2:1-12

During my childhood, one of the most feared diseases was polio, often
called “infantile paralysis” because most of those infected were young
children. Before a preventive vaccine was developed in the mid-1950s,
some 20,000 people were paralyzed by polio and about 1,000 died from
it each year in the United States alone.

In ancient times, paralysis was viewed as a permanent, hopeless
condition. But one group of men believed Jesus could help their
paralyzed friend. While Jesus was teaching in the village of
Capernaum, four of the men carried the man to Him. When they couldn’t
reach Jesus because of the crowd, “they made an opening in the roof
above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was
lying on” (Mark 2:1-4).

“When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, ‘Son, your
sins are forgiven’ ” (v. 5), followed by “Get up, take your mat and go
home” (v. 11). How remarkable that in response to the faith of the men
who brought their friend, Jesus forgave his sins and healed his
incurable condition!

When someone we know is facing serious physical difficulty or a
spiritual crisis, it is our privilege to join together in prayer,
bringing our friends to Jesus—the only One who can meet their deepest
needs.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, we know that You can speak the words of eternal life and
healing to people in great need. We bring them to You in prayer today.

Praying for others is a privilege—and a responsibility.
