Something To Hide

I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,” and You
forgave the iniquity of my sin. —
Psalm 32:5

Today's Scripture: Psalm 32

If you have something to hide, Mike Slattery may have the solution.
Several years ago, a cell-phone company wanted to erect an antenna on
his property and disguise it as a pine tree. Mike had a better idea
and built a fake barn with vinyl panels that allow the radio waves to
pass through them. He developed that concept into a company that
builds structures to hide antennas for aesthetic and security reasons.
Slattery is convinced that many of his neighbors still have no idea
what’s inside his barn (The Gazette, Colorado Springs).

Most of us are trying to keep something out of sight. It may be as
harmless as clutter in a basement or as toxic as the moral and
spiritual failings we try to hide from others, ourselves, and even
from God.

In Psalm 32, David described the futility of trying to conceal his sin
(vv.3-4) and the relief of opening his soul to the Lord: “I
acknowledged my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said,
‘I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,’ and You forgave the
iniquity of my sin” (v.5).

Confessing our sins to God and forsaking them brings a sense of
freedom to our souls and the awareness that we have nothing to hide.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, help me come to You When I would rather run and hide My
sinfulness and foolish ways; Forgive and make me clean inside. —Sper

Whenever we’re ready to uncover our sins, God is ready to cover them.
