Fiery Conversation

Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt. —
Colossians 4:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 3:2-10

Where I come from in northern Ghana, bush fires are regular
occurrences in the dry season between December and March. I’ve
witnessed many acres of farmland set ablaze when the winds carried
tiny embers from fireplaces or from cigarette butts carelessly thrown
by the roadside. With the dry grassland vegetation, all that is needed
to start a devastating fire is a little spark.

That is how James describes the tongue, calling it “a world of evil
among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the
whole course of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell”
(James 3:6 niv). A false statement made here or backbiting there, a
vicious remark somewhere else, and relationships are destroyed. “The
words of the reckless pierce like swords,” says Proverbs 12:18, “but
the tongue of the wise brings healing” (niv). Just as fire has both
destructive and useful elements, so “death and life are in the power
of the tongue” (18:21).

For conversation that reflects God’s presence in us and pleases Him,
let it “always be with grace” (Col. 4:6). When expressing our opinions
during disagreements, let’s ask God to help us choose wholesome
language that brings honor to Him.

Reflect & Pray

Guide my conversation today, Lord. May the words I choose bless and
encourage others and build them up rather than tear them down. May You
be pleased with what You hear.

Anger can make us speak our mind when we should be minding our speech.
