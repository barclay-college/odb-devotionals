True Greatness

Whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant. —
Mark 10:43

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 10:35-45

Some people feel like a small pebble lost in the immensity of a
canyon. But no matter how insignificant we judge ourselves to be, we
can be greatly used by God.

In a sermon early in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. quoted Jesus’ words
from Mark 10 about servanthood. Then he said, “Everybody can be great,
because everybody can serve. You don’t have to have a college degree
to serve. You don’t have to make your subject and your verb agree to
serve. You don’t have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve. . .
. You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love.”

When Jesus’ disciples quarreled about who would get the places of
honor in heaven, He told them: “Whoever desires to become great among
you shall be your servant. And whoever of you desires to be first
shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be
served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many” (Mark
10:43-45).

I wonder about us. Is that our understanding of greatness? Are we
gladly serving, doing tasks that may be unnoticed? Is the purpose of
our serving to please our Lord rather than to gain applause? If we are
willing to be a servant, our lives will point to the One who is truly
great.

Reflect & Pray

No service in itself is small, None great, though earth it fill; But
that is small that seeks its own, And great that does God’s will.

Little things done in Christ’s name are great things.
