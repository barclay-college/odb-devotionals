Traveling Companion

For I am a stranger with You, a sojourner, as all my fathers were. —
Psalm 39:12

Today's Scripture: Psalm 39

I looked up the members of my seminary graduating class recently and
discovered that many of my friends are now deceased. It was a sober
reminder of the brevity of life. Three score and ten, give or take a
few years, and we’re gone (Ps. 90:10). Israel’s poet was right: We’re
but strangers here and sojourners (39:12).

The brevity of life makes us think about our “end”—the measure of our
days and how fleeting they are (v.4), a feeling that grows more
certain as we draw closer to the end of our lives. This world is not
our home; we’re but strangers and sojourners here.

Yet we are not alone on the journey. We are strangers and sojourners
with God (39:12), a thought that makes the journey less troubling,
less frightening, less worrisome. We pass through this world and into
the next with a loving Father as our constant companion and guide.
We’re strangers here on earth, but we are never alone on the journey
(73:23-24). We have One who says, “I am with you always” (Matt.
28:20).

We may lose sight of father, mother, spouse, and friends, but we
always know that God is walking beside us. An old saying puts it like
this: “Good company on the road makes the way to seem lighter.”

Reflect & Pray

My times are in my Father’s hand; How could I wish or ask for more?
For He who has my pathway planned Will guide me till my journey’s
o’er. —Fraser

As you travel life’s weary road, let Jesus lift your heavy load.
