A Perfect Fit

Those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good
works. —
Titus 3:8

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 2:1-10

“What kind of skill set do you bring?” That question, posed in a job
interview, was intended to determine if my friend would be a good fit
for a position. My friend quickly did a mental review of his skills
and talents, hoping to emphasize the unique characteristics he
possessed that would contribute to the success of the company.

What if we already had the perfect set of skills required to
accomplish what God wants us to do? Well—as a matter of fact—we do!
The spiritual gifts we possess, along with our experiences, training,
natural talents, and a submissive heart make up a unique individual
who has the skills needed for the “good works” that God has “prepared
beforehand” (Eph. 2:10). If God has something He wants to accomplish
and that you feel He is calling you to do, He will provide what you
need to complete the task. Or, as one paraphrase emphasizes, God wants
us “to join Him in the work He does, the good work He has gotten ready
for us to do” (Eph. 2:10 The Message). The one thing He requires of us
is that we “be found faithful” (1 Cor. 4:2).

Have you found a place in God’s service where you can be used of Him?
Let’s “do good” and “be rich in good works” (1 Tim. 6:18).

Reflect & Pray

Think not that you are limited Because of what you cannot do, But
think instead of all you have— The talents God has given you. —D. De
Haan

Spiritual gifts are meant to be used, not admired.
