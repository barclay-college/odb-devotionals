Tell It On The Mountain

He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted.
And they came to Him. —
Mark 3:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 3:1-15

I was surprised to see a nationally distributed news article
commending a group of teenage snowboarders who hold weekly church
services on a Colorado ski slope. In the Summit Daily News, Kimberly
Nicoletti’s story captured a wide audience with her account of teens
who love to snowboard and to tell how Jesus changed their lives.
Undergirding the teenagers is a Christian youth organization equipping
them to demonstrate God’s love.

It’s easier to do things yourself than to train others, yet Jesus
poured Himself into a dozen disciples through whom His work would
reach the world. In the midst of the pressing need of people clamoring
to be healed, He climbed a mountain where “He appointed twelve, that
they might be with Him and that He might send them out” (Mark 3:14).

One of those snowboarders in Colorado said of her discipleship
training: “I’ve never been able to build relationships with family or
friends; I’ve kept them at arm’s length. [The program] showed me God’s
love. It opened me to reach out to people.”

Experiencing Jesus’ love and being in company with Him and His
followers, we find courage to act and speak in ways that honor our
Lord.

Reflect & Pray

Let us go forth, as called of God, Redeemed by Jesus’ precious blood;
His love to show, His life to live, His message speak, His mercy give.

Witnessing isn’t a job to be done but a life to be lived.
