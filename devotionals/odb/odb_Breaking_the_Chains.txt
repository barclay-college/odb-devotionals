Breaking the Chains

In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.
Ephesians 1:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 1:3–14

We found our visit to Christ Church Cathedral in Stone Town, Zanzibar,
deeply moving, for it sits on the site of what was formerly the
largest slave market in East Africa. The designers of this cathedral
wanted to show through a physical symbol how the gospel breaks the
chains of slavery. No longer would the location be a place of evil
deeds and horrible atrocities, but of God’s embodied grace.

Those who built the cathedral wanted to express how Jesus’s death on
the cross provides freedom from sin—that which the apostle Paul speaks
of in his letter to the church at Ephesus: “In him we have
redemption through his blood” (Ephesians 1:7). Here the word
redemption points to the Old Testament’s notion of the marketplace,
with someone buying back a person or item. Jesus buys back a person
from a life of slavery to sin and wrongdoing.

In Paul’s opening words in this letter (vv. 3–14), he bubbles over
with joy at the thought of his freedom in Christ. He points, in layer
after layer of praise, to God’s work of grace for us through Jesus’s
death, which sets us free from the cords of sin. No longer do we need
to be slaves to sin, for we are set free to live for God and His
glory.

Lord God, through the death of Your Son, You have given us life
forever. Help me to share this gift of grace with someone today.

Jesus redeems us from the slavery of sin.
