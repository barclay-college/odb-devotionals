Playing with Joy

The fruit of the Spirit is . . . joy.
Galatians 5:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 5:22–26

One of our sons, Brian, is a high school basketball coach. One year,
as his team was dribbling its way through the Washington State
Basketball Tournament, well-meaning folks around town asked, “Are you
going to win it all this year?” Both players and coaches felt the
pressure, so Brian adopted a motto: “Play with joy!”

I thought of the apostle Paul’s last words to the elders of Ephesus:
“That I may finish my race with joy” (Acts 20:24 nkjv ). His aim was
to complete the tasks Jesus had given him. I have made these words my
motto and my prayer: “May I run and finish my race with joy.” Or as
Brian says, “May I play with joy!” And by the way, Brian’s team did
win the state championship that year.

We all have good reasons to get grouchy: discouraging news, everyday
stresses, health problems. Nevertheless, God can give us a joy that
transcends these conditions if we ask Him. We can have what Jesus
called, “my joy” (John 15:11).

Joy is a fruit of the Spirit of Jesus (Galatians 5:22). So we must
remember each morning to ask Him to help us: “May I play with joy!”
Author Richard Foster said, “To pray is to change. This is a great
grace. How good of God to provide a path whereby our lives can be
taken over by . . . joy.”

Reflect & Pray

What causes you to be discouraged? Where do you find your joy?

I turn my eyes to You, God. I’m grateful I can count on Your
faithfulness to me. Please bring me into Your joy.
