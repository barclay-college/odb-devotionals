From Shame to Honor

[The Lord] has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the
people.
Luke 1:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 1:18–25

It’s that time of the year again, when families gather to celebrate
the festive season together. Some of us, however, dread meeting
certain “concerned” relatives whose questions can make those who are
still single or childless feel that there’s something wrong with them.

Imagine the plight of Elizabeth, who was childless despite being
married for many years. In her culture, that was seen as a sign of
God’s disfavor (see 1 Samuel 1:5–6) and could actually be considered
shameful. So while Elizabeth had been living righteously (Luke 1:6),
her neighbors and relatives may have suspected otherwise.

Nonetheless, Elizabeth and her husband continued to serve the Lord
faithfully. Then, when both were well advanced in years, a miracle
occurred. God heard her prayer (v. 13). He loves to show us His favor
(v. 25). And though He may seem to delay, His timing is always right
and His wisdom always perfect. For Elizabeth and her husband, God had
a special gift: a child who would become the Messiah’s forerunner
(Isaiah 40:3–5).

Do you feel inadequate because you seem to lack something—a university
degree, a spouse, a child, a job, a house? Keep living for Him
faithfully and waiting patiently for Him and His plan, just as
Elizabeth did. No matter our circumstances, God is working in and
through us. He knows your heart. He hears your prayers.

Reflect & Pray

God, You are forever faithful and good. Help us to keep trusting in
You, even when we experience heartache.

Keep living for Him faithfully and waiting patiently for His plan.
