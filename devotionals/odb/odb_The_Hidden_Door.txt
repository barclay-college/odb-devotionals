The Hidden Door

Blessed is the man who endures temptation. —
James 1:12

Today's Scripture: James 1:12-21

It wasn’t the first time it happened in sports, and it certainly won’t
be the last. But perhaps mentioning it again can help keep us from
making a similar shameful error.

A college coach—one noted for his Christian character—resigned in
disgrace after it was discovered that he had violated rules clearly
spelled out by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. One
magazine article concluded: “His integrity was one of the great myths
of college football.”

This was certainly an embarrassing time for the coach, but here’s the
most sobering part: It can happen to any of us. The temptation to go
behind the hidden door of secrecy in our lives and do things that
dishonor the Lord haunts us all. Indeed, we are all capable of turning
our own integrity into a myth—of turning our testimony for Jesus into
a sham. No matter what the temptation, we are all vulnerable.

So, how do we avoid giving in? We acknowledge the universality of
temptation (1 Cor. 10:13). We recognize the dangerous results of
giving in to sin (James 1:13-15). We keep accountable to fellow
believers (Eccl. 4:9-12). And we plead with God for help not to fall
(Matt. 26:41). Only God’s grace and power can keep us from falling and
pick us up when we do.

Reflect & Pray

The devil is clever, deceiving us all, He cunningly causes the
strongest to fall; But we his sly methods are sure to discern By
making God’s warnings our daily concern. —D. De Haan

Each sin has its door of entrance; let’s keep that door closed.
