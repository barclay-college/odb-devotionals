Obscured by Clouds

We fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.
2 Corinthians 4:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 4:16–18

A rare supermoon appeared in November 2016—the moon in its orbit
reached its closest point to the earth in over sixty years and so
appeared bigger and brighter than at other times. But for me that day
the skies were shrouded in gray. Although I saw photos of this wonder
from friends in other places, as I gazed upward I had to trust that
the supermoon was lurking behind the clouds.

The apostle Paul faced many hardships but believed that what is unseen
will last forever. He said how his “momentary troubles” achieve “an
eternal glory” (2 Corinthians 4:17). Thus he could fix his eyes “not
on what is seen, but on what is unseen,” because what is unseen is
eternal (v. 18). Paul yearned that the Corinthians and our faith would
grow, and although we suffer, that we too would trust in God. We might
not be able to see Him, but we can believe He is renewing us day by
day (v. 16).

I thought about how God is unseen but eternal when I gazed at the
clouds that day, knowing that the supermoon was hidden but there. And
I hoped the next time I was tempted to believe that God was far from
me, I would fix my eyes on what is unseen.

Reflect & Pray

What does it mean for you to fix your eyes on what is unseen? How does
your hope in Jesus help you face the difficulties of life?

Lord God, sometimes I feel like You’re far from me. Help me to believe
the truth that You are ever near, whether I feel Your presence or not.
