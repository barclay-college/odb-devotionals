Character Amnesia

There was a man . . . whose name was Job; and that man was blameless
and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. —
Job 1:1

Today's Scripture: Job 1:13-22

It seems that young people in China are beginning to forget how to
write the characters that comprise the beautiful calligraphy of their
traditional language. Some are calling the phenomenon “character
amnesia.” Heavy usage of computers and smart phones often means that
writing is neglected and some can no longer remember the characters
they learned in childhood. One young man said, “People don’t write
anything by hand anymore except for [their] name and address.”

Some people appear to have “character amnesia” of a different sort.
When faced with a dilemma, they seem to “forget” the right thing to do
and instead choose the easy way out.

God called Job “a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and
shuns evil” (Job 1:8). God allowed Satan to take everything Job
had—his children, his wealth, and his health. But despite his heart-
wrenching circumstances, Job refused to curse God. “In all this Job
did not sin nor charge God with wrong” (v.22). Satan had challenged
God’s assertion of Job’s blameless character, but he was proven wrong.

Character amnesia? No. Character is who we are; it’s not something we
“forget.” Those who have a loss of character make a choice.

Reflect & Pray

It isn’t the tranquil and placid seas That bring out the sailor’s
skill; It’s the wind and waves that pound his ship And toss it about
at will. —Ritter

When wealth is gone, little is lost; when health is gone, something is
lost; but when character is gone, all is lost!
