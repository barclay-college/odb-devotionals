One Name

At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and
under the earth.
Philippians 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:5–11

Cleopatra, Galileo, Shakespeare, Elvis, Pelé. They are all so well
known that they need only one name to be recognized. They have
remained prominent in history because of who they were and what they
did. But there is another name that stands far above these or any
other name!

Before the Son of God was born into this world, the angel told Mary
and Joseph to name Him Jesus because “he will save his people from
their sins” (Matthew 1:21), and “he . . . will be called the Son of
the Most High” (Luke 1:32). Jesus didn’t come as a celebrity but as a
servant who humbled Himself and died on the cross so that anyone who
receives Him can be forgiven and freed from the power of sin.

The apostle Paul wrote, “God exalted him to the highest place and gave
him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every
tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father” (Philippians 2:9–11).

In our times of greatest joy and our deepest need, the name we cling
to is Jesus. He will never leave us, and His love will not fail.

Reflect & Pray

Jesus, You are the name above all names, our Savior and Lord. We lift
our praise to You as we celebrate Your presence and power in our lives
today.

Jesus Christ is not valued at all until He is valued above all.
