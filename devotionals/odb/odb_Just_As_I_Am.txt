Just As I Am

Incline your ear, and come to Me. Hear, and your soul shall live. —
Isaiah 55:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 55:1-7

Good memories flooded my mind as I sat in a concert. The group’s
leader had just introduced the song they were about to sing: “Just As
I Am.” I remembered how years ago at the end of his sermons my pastor
would ask people to come forward while we sang that song, indicating
they would like to receive the forgiveness Christ offers for their
sins.

But the leader of the musical group at the concert suggested another
occasion when we might sing this song. He commented that he likes to
think that when he dies and goes to meet the Lord one day, he will
sing in thanks to Him:

Just as I am, without one plea

But that Thy blood was shed for me,

And that Thou bidd’st me come to Thee,

O Lamb of God, I come!

Years before writing this song, Charlotte Elliott asked a minister how
she might find the Lord. He told her, “Just come to Him as you are.”
She did, and later during a discouraging time of illness, she wrote
this hymn about the day she came to Christ and He forgave her sin.

In His Word, the Lord encourages us to seek Him: “Seek the Lord while
He may be found, call upon Him while He is near” (Isa. 55:6). He calls
to our hearts: “Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters . . . .
Incline your ear, and come to Me. Hear, and your soul shall live”
(vv.1,3).

Because of Jesus’ death and resurrection, we can come to Him right now
and will one day go into eternity to be with Him forever. Just as I am
. . . I come!
