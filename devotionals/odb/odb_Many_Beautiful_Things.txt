Many Beautiful Things

She has done a beautiful thing to me.
Mark 14:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 14:1–9

Just before her death, artist and missionary Lilias Trotter looked out
a window and saw a vision of a heavenly chariot. According to her
biographer, a friend asked, “Are you seeing many beautiful things?”
She answered, “Yes, many, many beautiful things.”

Trotter’s final words reflect God’s work in her life. Not only in
death, but throughout her life, He revealed much beauty to her and
through her. Although a talented artist, she chose to serve Jesus as a
missionary in Algeria. John Ruskin, a famous painter who tutored her,
is said to have commented, “What a waste,” when she chose the mission
field over a career in art.

Similarly, in the New Testament, when a woman came to Simon the
Leper’s house with an alabaster jar and poured perfume on Jesus’s
head, those present saw it as a waste. This expensive perfume was
worth a year’s common wages, so some of the people present thought it
could have been used to help the poor. However, commending this
woman’s deep devotion to Him, Jesus said, “She has done a beautiful
thing to me” (Mark 14:6).

Every day we can choose to let Christ’s life shine in our lives and
display His beauty to the world. To some, it may seem a waste, but let
us have willing hearts to serve Him. May Jesus say we have done many
beautiful things for Him.
