Toxic Living

Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the
commandment of the Lord.” —
1 Samuel 13:13

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 13:7-14

Picher, Oklahoma, is no more. In mid-2009, this once-bustling town of
20,000 went out of business. In the first quarter of the 1900s, Picher
was a boomtown because of its abundant lead and zinc. Workers
extracted the ore, which was used to help arm the US during both World
Wars.

The town faded as the ore began to run out—but the biggest problem was
that while the lead and zinc brought wealth, they also brought
pollution. Because nothing was done to deal with the pollution, Picher
became a toxic wasteland, and the government condemned the land.

What happened to Picher can happen to people. Prosperity can look so
good that it’s hard to think about possible downsides. Actions that
are detrimental to long-term spiritual health are accepted, and unless
the problem is corrected, destruction follows. It happened to King
Saul. He began as a good king, but in seeking success he failed to see
the damage he was doing. Turning his back on God’s commands, he acted
“foolishly” (1 Sam. 13:13) and lost his kingdom (v.14).

In our attempts to find success, we need to watch out for spiritual
pollution that comes when we fail to follow God’s clear scriptural
guidelines. Godly living always beats toxic living.

Reflect & Pray

The Lord has given us commands And told us to obey; Our own designs
are sure to fail If we neglect His way! —Bosch

No one can be a real success without God.
