The Tree Of Love

[Jesus] bore our sins in His own body on the tree. —
1 Peter 2:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 27:27-35

The corkscrew willow tree stood vigil over our backyard for more than
20 years. It shaded all four of our children as they played in the
yard, and it provided shelter for the neighborhood squirrels. But when
springtime came and the tree didn’t awaken from its winter slumber, it
was time to bring it down.

Every day for a week I worked on that tree—first to fell it and then
to chop two decades of growth into manageable pieces. It gave me a lot
of time to think about trees.

I thought about the first tree—the one on which hung the forbidden
fruit that Adam and Eve just couldn’t resist (Gen. 3:6). God used that
tree to test their loyalty and trust. Then there’s the tree in Psalm 1
that reminds us of the fruitfulness of godly living. And in Proverbs
3:18, wisdom is personified as a tree of life.

But it is a transplanted tree that is most important—the crude cross
of Calvary that was hewn from a sturdy tree. There our Savior hung
between heaven and earth to bear every sin of every generation on His
shoulders. It stands above all trees as a symbol of love, sacrifice,
and salvation.

At Calvary, God’s only Son suffered a horrible death on a cross.
That’s the tree of life for us.

Reflect & Pray

Father, on this day between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, we’re
grateful for the cross and for Your Son who gave His life so that we
might have life. Thank You.

The cross of Christ reveals man’s sin at its worst and God’s love at
its best.
