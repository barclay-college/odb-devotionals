To Be Continued

You shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and to the end of the earth. —
Acts 1:8

Today's Scripture: Acts 1:1-11

The fifth book of the New Testament, the Acts of the Apostles, records
the beginnings of the Christian church under the leadership of the
people Jesus had appointed. Some scholars have suggested that this
book could also be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit, because the
Spirit’s power supplied courage for the apostles in the face of every
hardship.

Just before Jesus was taken up into heaven, He told the ones He had
chosen: “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea
and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” (Acts 1:8). With those
words, one chapter in the story of God’s work on earth ended, and a
new one began. We are a part of that ongoing story.

The book of Acts describes the faithful witness of Peter, John,
Barnabas, Paul, Dorcas, Lydia, and many others during the early days
of the church. These ordinary people depended on God to give them
strength as they spread His Word and demonstrated His love.

That story continues through us. As we trust God and obey His
direction to make Jesus known, He writes through us new pages in His
story of redemption.

Reflect & Pray

Gracious Spirit, use my words to help and heal. Use my actions, bold
and meek, to speak for You. May You be pleased to reveal Your life to
others through mine.

People know true faith stories when they see them.
