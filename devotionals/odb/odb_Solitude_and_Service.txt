Solitude and Service

He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and
healed those who needed healing.
Luke 9:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 9:1-2,10-17

Comedian Fred Allen said, “A celebrity is a person who works hard all
his life to become well-known, then wears dark glasses to avoid being
recognized.” Fame often brings loss of privacy along with a relentless
frenzy of attention.

When Jesus began His public ministry of teaching and healing, He was
catapulted into the public eye and thronged by people seeking help.
Crowds followed Him wherever He went. But Jesus knew that having
regular time alone with God was essential to maintaining strength and
perspective.

After Jesus’ twelve disciples returned from their successful mission
“to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick,” He took them to
a quiet place to rest (Luke 9:2,10). Soon, however, crowds of people
found them and Jesus welcomed them. He “spoke to them about the
kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing” (v. 11). Instead
of sending them away to find food, the Lord provided an outdoor picnic
for 5,000! (vv. 12-17).

Jesus was not immune to the pressure of curious and hurting people,
but He maintained the balance of public service and private solitude
by taking time for rest and for prayer alone with His Father (Luke
5:16).

May we follow our Lord’s example as we serve others in His name.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, as Jesus Your Son and our Savior honored You in solitude
and service to others, may we follow His example in our lives.

Turning down the volume of life allows you to listen to God.
