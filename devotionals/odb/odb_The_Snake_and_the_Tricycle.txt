The Snake and the Tricycle

I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning.
Luke 1:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 1:1–4

For years, I had retold a story from a time in Ghana when my brother
and I were toddlers. As I recalled it, he had parked our old iron
tricycle on a small cobra. The trike was too heavy for the snake,
which remained trapped under the front wheel.

But after my aunt and my mother had both passed away, we discovered a
long-lost letter from Mom recounting the incident. In reality, I had
parked the tricycle on the snake, and my brother had run to tell Mom.
Her eyewitness account, written close to the actual event, revealed
the reality.

The historian Luke understood the importance of accurate records. He
explained how the story of Jesus was “handed down to us by those who
from the first were eyewitnesses” (Luke 1:2). “I too decided to write
an orderly account for you,” he wrote to Theophilus, “so that you may
know the certainty of the things you have been taught” (vv. 3–4). The
result was the gospel of Luke. Then, in his introduction to the book
of Acts, Luke said of Jesus, “After his suffering, he presented
himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive”
(Acts 1:3).

Our faith is not based on hearsay or wishful thinking. It is rooted in
the well-documented life of Jesus, who came to give us peace with God.
His Story stands.
