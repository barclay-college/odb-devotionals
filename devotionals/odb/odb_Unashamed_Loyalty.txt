Unashamed Loyalty

Glorify the Lord with me; let us exalt his name together.
Psalm 34:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 34:1–4

Sports fans love to sing their teams’ praises. By wearing logos,
posting notes on Facebook about their beloved teams, or talking about
them with friends, fans leave no doubt where their loyalty stands. My
own Detroit Tigers caps, shirts, and conversations indicate that I am
right there with those who do this.

Our sports loyalties can remind us that our truest and greatest
loyalty must be to our Lord. I think of such unashamed loyalty when I
read Psalm 34, where David draws our attention to Someone vastly more
vital than anything else on earth.

David says, “I will extol the Lord at all times” (v. 1), and we are
left to wonder about the gaps in our lives when we live as if God is
not our source of truth, light, and salvation. He says, “His praise
will always be on my lips” (v. 1), and we think about how many times
we praise things of this world more than we praise Him. David says,
“My soul shall make its boast in the Lord ” (v. 2 nkjv ), and we
realize that we boast about our own small successes more than what
Jesus has done for us.

It’s not wrong to enjoy our teams, our interests, and our
accomplishments. But our highest praise goes to our Lord. “Glorify the
Lord with me; let us exalt his name together” (v. 3).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to have Your praise be on my lips and to boast in You.
Help me to keep my focus on You.

Loyalty is the test of true love.
