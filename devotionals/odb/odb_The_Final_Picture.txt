The Final Picture

Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these things. —
Isaiah 40:26

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 40:21-31

What started as an empty 11-acre field in Belfast, Northern Ireland,
ended up as the largest land portrait in the British Isles. Wish, by
artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada, is made from 30,000 wooden pegs, 2,000
tons of soil, 2,000 tons of sand, and miscellaneous items such as
grass, stones, and string.

At the beginning, only the artist knew what the final artwork was
going to look like. He hired workers and recruited volunteers to haul
materials and move them into place. As they worked, they saw little
indication that something amazing was about to emerge. But it did.
From the ground, it doesn’t look like much. But from above, viewers
see a huge portrait—the smiling face of a little girl.

God is doing something on a grander scale in the world. He’s the
artist who sees the final picture. We’re His “fellow workers” (1 Cor.
3:9) who are helping to make it a reality. Through the prophet Isaiah,
God reminded His people that it is He who “sits above the circle of
the earth” and “stretches out the heavens like a curtain” (Isa.
40:22). We can’t see the final picture, but we continue on in faith,
knowing that we’re part of an amazing work of art—one that is being
created on earth but will be best seen from heaven.

Reflect & Pray

While sometimes I think I can see the big picture, Lord, my heart
knows it sees so little. I’m thankful that You are working out Your
beautiful will in this world, and I can trust You.

God is using us to help create a masterpiece.
