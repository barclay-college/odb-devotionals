The Gift of Giving

Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give,
not reluctantly or under compulsion.
2 Corinthians 9:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 3:7–14

A pastor breathed life into the phrase “He’d give you the shirt off
his back” when he gave this unsettling challenge to his church: “What
would happen if we took the coats off our backs and gave them to the
needy?” Then he took his own coat and laid it at the front of the
church. Dozens of others followed his example. This was during the
winter, so the trip home was less comfortable that day. But for dozens
of people in need, the season warmed up just a bit.

When John the Baptist roamed the Judean wilderness, he had a stern
warning for the crowd that came to hear him. “You brood of vipers!” he
said. “Produce fruit in keeping with repentance” (Luke 3:7–8).
Startled, they asked him, “What should we do then?” He responded with
this advice: “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who
has none, and anyone who has food should do the same” (vv. 10–11).
True repentance produces a generous heart.

Because “God loves a person who gives cheerfully” (nlt), giving should
never be guilt-based or pressured (2 Cor. 9:7). But when we give
freely and generously, we find that it truly is more blessed to give
than to receive.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for the many ways You bless us. Forgive us for so
often taking Your goodness for granted. Show us what we have that we
might use to bless someone else today.

Whoever refreshes others will be refreshed. Proverbs 11:25
