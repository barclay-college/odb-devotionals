Fantastic Offers

[God’s] abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through
the resurrection of Jesus. —
1 Peter 1:3

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 1:3-9

I am amazed at the unbelievable offers that flood my e-mail box every
day. Recently, I added up the offers of free money that came to me in
a week, and my “take” totaled $26 million. But each of those offers
was a fraud. Every one—from a $1 million prize to a $7 million
offer—was nothing but a lie sent by unscrupulous people to squeeze
money from me.

We’re all vulnerable to fantastic offers—to scams that in reality pay
off with nothing but trouble. We are offered false hope that ends in
dashed dreams.

There is one offer, however, that is genuine, though fantastic beyond
belief. It’s the offer God makes to us—salvation through faith in
Jesus’ finished work on the cross: “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31). It is an offer that cost Him
greatly—and we get the benefits. The book of Romans tells us, “He was
delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our
justification” (4:25 niv).

By saying yes to salvation, we can have hope (Titus 1:2), peace (Rom.
5:1), forgiveness (Eph. 1:7), incomparable riches (2:7), and
redemption (4:30). This is the real deal. Jesus’ death and
resurrection guarantees it.
