Each Life A Gift

I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. —
Psalm 139:14

Today's Scripture: Psalm 139:1-16

A young woman was pregnant but unmarried. And even though she lived in
a society that didn’t place a high value on unborn life, she wisely
chose to allow her baby to live.

The child, whom she generously made available for adoption, became
part of a loving Christian family who nurtured their precious
daughter, loved her, and showed her the way to Christ.

Before that girl reached adulthood, however, she died. Her death left
a massive void in her family’s life, but it also left behind memories
of childhood joy and youthful enthusiasm. Sure, her death created a
gaping hole in the hearts of all who loved her, but imagine what they
would have missed had they never held her in their arms, shared Jesus
with her, laughed with her, taught her, and cherished her.

Every life—every child—is a wonderfully made sample of God’s handiwork
(Ps. 139). Every human is an image-bearing likeness of God (Gen. 1:27)
and a descendant of our first God-breathed parent, Adam.

Death robs us of a certain completion we desire in a life, but it also
reminds us of the value of each life God creates (Col. 1:16). Cherish
the gift of life and savor the joy of God’s handiwork.

Reflect & Pray

Every life has been created— God’s handiwork displayed; When we
cherish His creation, We value what He’s made. —Sper

All life is created by God and bears His autograph.
