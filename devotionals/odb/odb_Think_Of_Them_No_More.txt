Think Of Them No More

I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake;
and I will not remember your sins. —
Isaiah 43:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 43:22-28

My early years as a believer in Christ were laden with foreboding. I
had the impression that when Jesus comes back, all my sins will be
portrayed on a giant screen for everyone to see.

I know now that God chooses not to remember against me a single one of
my transgressions. Every sin has been buried in the deepest sea, never
to be exhumed and examined again.

Amy Carmichael wrote, “A day or two ago I was thinking rather sadly of
the past—so many sins and failures and lapses of every kind. I was
reading Isaiah 43, and in verse 24 I saw myself: ‘You have wearied me
with your iniquities.’ And then for the first time I noticed that
there is no space between verse 24 and verse 25: ‘I, even I, am He who
blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and I will not remember
your sins.’”

Indeed, when our Lord comes back He will “bring to light the hidden
things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each
one’s praise will come from God” (1 Cor. 4:5). On that day our works
will be tried and we may suffer loss, but we will not be judged for
sin (3:11-15). God will see what Christ has done for us. He “will not
remember [our] sins.”

Reflect & Pray

Where no far-reaching tide with its powerful sweep May stir the dark
waves of forgetfulness deep, I have buried them there where no mortal
can see! I’ve cast all thy sins in the depths of the sea. —Anon.

When God saves us, our sins are forgiven forever.
