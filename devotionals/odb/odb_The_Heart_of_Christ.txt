The Heart of Christ

Please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you
have written.
Exodus 32:32

Today's Scripture: Exodus 32:21–32

An Australian journalist who spent 400 days in an Egyptian jail
expressed mixed emotions when he was released. While admitting his
relief, he said he accepted his freedom with incredible concern for
the friends he was leaving behind. He said he found it extremely hard
to say goodbye to fellow reporters who had been arrested and jailed
with him—not knowing how much longer they were going to be held.

Moses also expressed great anxiety at the thought of leaving friends
behind. When faced with the thought of losing the brother, sister, and
nation that had worshiped a golden calf while he was meeting with God
on Mount Sinai (Ex. 32:11–14), he interceded for them. Showing how
deeply he cared, he pled, “But now, please forgive their sin—but if
not, then blot me out of the book you have written” (v. 32).

The apostle Paul later expressed a similar concern for family,
friends, and nation. Grieving their unbelief in Jesus, Paul said he
would be willing to give up his own relationship with Christ if by
such love he could save his brothers and sisters (Rom. 9:3).

Looking back, we see that Moses and Paul both expressed the heart of
Christ. Yet, the love they could only feel, and the sacrifice they
could only offer, Jesus fulfilled—to be with us forever.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, thank You for reminding us how much it is like You
to be willing to live—and die—for those who have not yet seen how much
You love them.

Caring for others honors Jesus’s love for us.
