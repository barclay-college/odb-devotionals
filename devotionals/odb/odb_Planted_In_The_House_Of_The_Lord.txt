Planted In The House Of The Lord

They shall still bear fruit in old age; they shall be fresh and
flourishing. —
Psalm 92:14

Today's Scripture: Psalm 92

After conducting a series of interviews with elderly people, author
Don Gold published the book Until the Singing Stops: A Celebration of
Life and Old Age in America.

Gold loved and admired his grandmother, and it was the memory of her
that moved him to meet and learn from other elderly people. He recalls
that on the way to one of his interviews, he got lost on a dusty
country road in Missouri. When he pulled into a farm to ask for
directions, a teenager came up, listened, shrugged his shoulders, and
then replied, “Don’t know.” So he drove on. A few miles farther down
the road, he stopped again at a farmhouse. The farmer, who was an old
man, graciously gave him flawless directions.

Perhaps, Gold mused, that experience sums up what he was searching for
when the memory of his grandmother sent him out to find people like
her. He was looking for someone to guide him in his life journey.

If you’re “young,” seek out older people who have been drinking deeply
from God’s love and goodness throughout their life. They have wisdom
to share that will help you so that you also might flourish and grow
in your faith (Ps. 92:12-14).
