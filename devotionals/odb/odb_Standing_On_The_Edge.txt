Standing On The Edge

[The Israelites] set out . . . to cross over the Jordan, with the
priests bearing the ark of the covenant before [them]. —
Joshua 3:14

Today's Scripture: Joshua 3:9-17

My little girl stood apprehensively at the pool’s edge. As a
nonswimmer, she was just learning to become comfortable in the water.
Her instructor waited in the pool with outstretched arms. As my
daughter hesitated, I saw the questions in her eyes: Will you catch
me? What will happen if my head goes under?

The Israelites may have wondered what would happen when they crossed
the Jordan River. Could they trust God to make dry ground appear in
the riverbed? Was God guiding their new leader, Joshua, as He had led
Moses? Would God help His people defeat the threatening Canaanites who
lived just across the river?

To learn the answers to these questions, the Israelites had to engage
in a test of faith—they had to act. So they “set out from their camp
to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the
covenant before [them]” (v.14). Exercising their faith allowed them to
see that God was with them. He was still directing Joshua, and He
would help them settle in Canaan (vv.7,10,17).

If you are facing a test of faith, you too can move forward based on
God’s character and His unfailing promises. Relying on Him will help
you move from where you are to where He wants you to be.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we’re prone to quickly forget Your goodness and care for us. May
we trust You today and into the new year—whatever uncertainties we
face. You are the God who can be trusted.

Fear fades when we trust our Father.
