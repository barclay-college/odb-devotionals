The Fingerprint of God

For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
which God prepared in advance for us to do.
Ephesians 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:1–10

Lygon Stevens loved to climb mountains with her brother Nick. They
were experienced climbers and both had summitted Mt. McKinley
(Denali), the highest point in North America. Then, in January 2008,
they were swept off a Colorado mountain by an avalanche, injuring Nick
and killing twenty-year-old Lygon. When Nick later discovered his
sister’s journal in one of her satchels, he was deeply comforted by
its contents. It was filled with reflections, prayers, and praise to
God as seen in this entry: “I am a work of art, signed by God. But
He’s not done; in fact, He has just begun. . . . I have on me the
fingerprint of God. Never will there ever be another person like me. .
. . I have a job to do in this life that no other can do.”

Although Lygon is no longer physically present on earth, through the
legacy of her life and her journal she inspires and challenges those
she left behind.

Because we are made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26), each person is a
“work of art, signed by God.” As the apostle Paul says, “We are God’s
handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God
prepared in advance for us to do” (Ephesians 2:10).

Praise God that He uses each of us, in His own time and way, to help
others.

Reflect & Pray

How would You like to use me, Lord? I am open and willing.

Each person is a unique expression of God’s loving design.
