Hurry Not

You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast,
because they trust in you.
Isaiah 26:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 26:1–4

“Ruthlessly eliminate hurry.” When two friends repeated that adage by
the wise Dallas Willard to me, I knew I needed to consider it. Where
was I spinning my wheels, wasting time and energy? More important,
where was I rushing ahead and not looking to God for guidance and
help? In the weeks and months that followed, I remembered those words
and reoriented myself back to the Lord and His wisdom. I reminded
myself to trust in Him, rather than leaning on my own ways.

After all, rushing around frantically seems to be the opposite of the
“perfect peace” the prophet Isaiah speaks of. The Lord gives this gift
to “those whose minds are steadfast,” because they trust in Him (v.
3). And He is worthy of being trusted today, tomorrow, and forever,
for “the Lord , the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal” (v. 4).
Trusting God with our minds fixed on Him is the antidote to a hurried
life.

How about us? Do we sense that we’re hurried or even hasty? Maybe, in
contrast, we often experience a sense of peace. Or perhaps we’re
somewhere in between the two extremes.

Wherever we may be, I pray today that we’ll be able to put aside any
hurry as we trust the Lord, who will never fail us and who gives us
His peace.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, You give the peace that passes all understanding, which is a
gift I don’t want to take for granted. Thank You.

God’s peace helps us not to hurry.
