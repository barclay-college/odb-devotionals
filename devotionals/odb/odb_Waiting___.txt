Waiting . . .

Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in
prayer. —
Romans 12:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 130

Day after day for years Harry shared with the Lord his concern for his
son-in-law John who had turned away from God. But then Harry died. A
few months later, John turned back to God. When his mother-in-law
Marsha told him that Harry had been praying for him every day, John
replied, “I waited too long.” But Marsha joyfully shared: “The Lord is
still answering the prayers Harry prayed during his earthly life.”

Harry’s story is an encouragement to us who pray and wait. He
continued “steadfastly in prayer” and waited patiently (Rom. 12:12).

The author of Psalm 130 experienced waiting in prayer. He said, “I
wait for the Lord, my soul waits” (v.5). He found hope in God because
he knew that “with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is abundant
redemption” (v.7).

Author Samuel Enyia wrote about God’s timing: “God does not depend on
our time. Our time is chronological and linear but God . . . is
timeless. He will act at the fullness of His time. Our prayer . . .
may not necessarily rush God into action, but . . . places us before
Him in fellowship.”

What a privilege we have to fellowship with God in prayer and to wait
for the answer in the fullness of His time.

Reflect & Pray

Pray on! Pray on! Cease not to pray, And should the answer tarry,
wait; Thy God will come, will surely come, And He can never come too
late. —Chisholm

God may delay our request, but He will never disappoint our trust.
