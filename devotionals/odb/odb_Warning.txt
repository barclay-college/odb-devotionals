Warning!

His name means Fool, and folly goes with him!
1 Samuel 25:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Samuel 25:1–12

The following warnings have been found on consumer products:

“Remove child before folding.” (baby stroller)

“Does not supply oxygen.” (dust mask)

“Never operate your speakerphone while driving.” (hands-free cell
phone product called the “Drive ’n’ Talk”)

“This product moves when used.” (scooter)

An appropriate warning label that Nabal could have worn would have
been: “Expect folly from a fool” (see 1 Sam. 25). He certainly was
irrational as he addressed David. On the run from Saul, David had
provided security detail for the sheep of a wealthy man named Nabal.
When David learned that Nabal was shearing those sheep and celebrating
with a feast, he sent ten of his men to politely ask for food as
remuneration for these duties (vv. 4–8).

Nabal’s response to David’s request was beyond rude. He said, “Who is
this David? . . . Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat .
. . , and give it to men coming from who knows where?” (vv. 10–11). He
broke the hospitality code of the day by not inviting David to the
feast, disrespected him by calling out insults, and essentially stole
from him by not paying him for his work.

The truth is, we all have a little bit of Nabal in us. We act
foolishly at times. The only cure for this is to acknowledge our sin
to God. He will step in to forgive us, instruct us, and give us His
wisdom.

Reflect & Pray

I’m selfish sometimes, Lord. I get more concerned with what I need
than what others need. Give me a heart of integrity and compassion.

God’s wisdom overshadows our self-centeredness.
