Looking Up

Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
Colossians 3:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:1–4

The cockeyed squid lives in the ocean’s “twilight zone” where sunlight
barely filters through the deep waters. The squid’s nickname is a
reference to its two extremely different eyes: the left eye develops
over time to become considerably larger than the right—almost twice as
big. Scientists studying the mollusk have deduced that the squid uses
its right eye, the smaller one, to look down into the darker depths.
The larger, left eye, gazes upward, toward the sunlight.

The squid is an unlikely depiction of what it means to live in our
present world and also in the future certainty we await as people who
“have been raised with Christ” (Colossians 3:1). In Paul’s letter to
the Colossians, he insists we ought to “set [our] minds on things
above” because our lives are “hidden with Christ in God” (vv. 2–3).

As earth-dwellers awaiting our lives in heaven, we keep an eye trained
on what’s happening around us in our present reality. But just as the
squid’s left eye develops over time into one that’s larger and more
sensitive to what’s happening overhead, we too can grow in our
awareness of the ways God works in the spiritual realm. We may not
have yet fully grasped what it means to be alive in Jesus, but as we
look “up,” our eyes will begin to see it more and more.

Reflect & Pray

How can you develop your “upward” vision? How can you set your mind on
heavenly things?

Loving God, help me to set my mind and heart on those things that are
