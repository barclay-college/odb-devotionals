A Search For The Top Ten

Oh, how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day. —
Psalm 119:97

Today's Scripture: Psalm 119:97-104

BibleGateway, an online Bible resource, looked at the viewing habits
of some of their 8 million monthly visitors. They found that John 3:16
was the most-searched-for verse in 2010.

I don’t think it’s surprising that it would be number one on the list.
It tells us that God loved us so much that He sent His Son to rescue
us from our sin and give us everlasting life. Number 10 on the list is
Jesus’ commission to His followers to spread that good news: “Go
therefore and make disciples of all the nations” (Matt. 28:19). Also
in the top 10 are Jeremiah 29:11 and Romans 8:28 about God’s good
plans and purposes for His people.

The Scriptures are filled with truths to search out and share. In
Psalm 119, the longest chapter in the Bible, the psalmist shared his
thoughts about the Word and his desire to search it and be taught by
God. He said, “Oh, how I love Your law!” (v.97). Our Bible reading for
today shows some of the psalmist’s reasons for loving it: It gives him
wisdom and understanding, it restrains his feet from evil, and it is
sweet. Therefore, it’s his meditation “all the day.”

Let’s keep taking the time to read the Bible. The more we search the
Word, the more we’ll grow in our love for it and its Author (v.97).
