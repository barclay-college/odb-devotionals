Old School

I desire . . . that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel. —
1 Timothy 2:8-9

Today's Scripture: 1 Timothy 2:8-10;

As we hurtle through the first part of this new century, we see an
increase in people questioning time-honored standards. This was
plainly detailed recently by a teen pop star—a girl who professes
faith in Jesus.

While discussing standards for modesty in how she dresses, she
discounted criticism of her skimpy clothing by saying, “That’s so old
school.”

This young woman is both right and wrong. In a sense, she’s right. The
standards of dress for Christians are “old school.” They were written
down more than 2,000 years ago. But her attitude that suggests ancient
standards can be set aside is wrong. In the truest sense, the
principles in the Bible are not “old” as much as they are timeless.
While written ages ago, they are still fresh and applicable.

As to the question of modesty, when the Bible says women should “adorn
themselves in modest apparel” (1 Tim. 2:9), it is still true today
that we shouldn’t dress to draw attention to ourselves. A more general
principle, “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed”
(Rom. 12:2), is a 2011 command that can guide the question of how we
dress.

So whether you’re a pop star or a pew sitter, don’t worry about being
“old school” if what you are doing is done according to the Book.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help us to follow the timeless standards of the Bible in
speech, clothing, and other lifestyle matters. May all we say and do
bring glory to You. Amen.

Do my choices bring glory to God or draw attention to me?
