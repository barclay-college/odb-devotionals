No Need Is Too Trivial

As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear
Him. —
Psalm 103:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 49:13-18

Several mothers of small children were sharing encouraging answers to
prayer. Yet one woman said she felt selfish about troubling God with
her personal needs. “Compared with the huge global needs God faces,”
she explained, “my circumstances must seem trivial to Him.”

Moments later, her little son pinched his fingers in a door and ran
screaming to his mother. She didn’t say, “How selfish of you to bother
me with your throbbing fingers when I’m busy!” She showed him great
compassion and tenderness.

As Psalm 103:13 reminds us, this is the response of love, both human
and divine. In Isaiah 49, God said that even though a mother may
forget to have compassion on her child, the Lord never forgets His
children (v.15). God assured His people, “I have inscribed you on the
palms of My hands” (v.16).

Such intimacy with God belongs to those who fear Him and who rely on
Him rather than on themselves. As that child with throbbing fingers
ran freely to his mother, so may we run to God with our daily
problems.

Our compassionate God doesn’t neglect others to respond to our
concerns. He has limitless time and love for each of His children. No
need is too trivial for Him.

Reflect & Pray

You take great delight in me, Lord, and quiet me with Your love. You
rejoice over me with singing, like a mother singing a lullaby over her
child. Thank You for Your tender love for me.

God holds His children in the palm of His hand.
