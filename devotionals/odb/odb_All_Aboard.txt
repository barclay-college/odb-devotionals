All Aboard

The Lord is . . . longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should
perish. —
2 Peter 3:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Peter 3:1-13

One day when I dropped my husband off at our local train station, I
watched as the conductor scanned the area for stragglers. A woman with
wet hair bounded from the parking lot and up into the train. Then, a
man in a dark suit strode to the platform and climbed aboard. The
conductor waited patiently while several more late-comers sprinted to
the tracks and boarded at the last moment.

Just as the conductor was patient with people boarding the train, God
patiently waits for people to come to know Him. However, someday Jesus
will return and “the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and
the elements will melt with fervent heat” (2 Peter 3:10). When this
happens, or when our physical bodies die, it will be too late to
establish a relationship with God.

“The Lord is . . . longsuffering toward us,” Peter says, “not willing
that any should perish but that all should come to repentance” (v.9).
If you have delayed deciding to follow Christ, there is good news—you
can still commit yourself to Him. “If you declare with your mouth
‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from
the dead, you will be saved” (Rom. 10:9 niv). He is calling. Will you
run in His direction?

Reflect & Pray

Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, Calling for you and for me; See,
on the portals He’s waiting and watching, Watching for you and for me.

Now is the time to choose the Lord.
