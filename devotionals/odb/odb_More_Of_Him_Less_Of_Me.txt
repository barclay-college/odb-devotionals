More Of Him, Less Of Me

I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of
Christ Jesus my Lord. —
Philippians 3:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:1-11

While I was pastoring a church early in my ministry, my daughter Libby
asked me, “Dad, are we famous?” To which I replied, “No, Libby, we’re
not famous.” She thought for a moment and then said rather
indignantly, “Well, we would be if more people knew about us!”

Poor Libby! Only 7 years old and already struggling with what many of
us struggle with throughout life: Who recognizes us, and are we
getting the recognition we think we deserve?

Our desire for recognition wouldn’t be such a problem if it didn’t
tend to replace Jesus as the focus of our attention. But being
absorbed with ourselves crowds Him out of the picture.

Life cannot be all about us and all about Jesus at the same time. This
makes Paul’s statement that he counted “everything as loss because of
the surpassing worth of knowing Christ” (Phil. 3:8 esv) strategically
important. Faced with a choice between himself and Jesus, Paul
intentionally discarded the things that would draw attention to
himself so he could concentrate on knowing and experiencing Jesus
(vv.7-8,10).

For us, the decision is the same. Will we live to draw attention to
ourselves? Or will we focus on the privilege of knowing and
experiencing Jesus more intimately?

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for reminding me of the value of knowing You more
intimately. Help me to keep myself out of the way as I pursue a deeper
walk with You.

Do our choices bring honor to God or to us?
