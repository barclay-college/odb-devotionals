Twinkle

Shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word
of life.
Philippians 2:15–16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:14–16

“Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” is an English lullaby. Its lyrics,
originally a poem by Jane Taylor, capture the wonder of God’s universe
where stars hang “up above the world so high.” In the rarely published
later stanzas, the star acts as a guide: “As your bright and tiny
spark lights the traveler in the dark.”

In Philippians, Paul challenges believers in Philippi to be blameless
and pure as they “shine . . . like stars in the sky” while offering
the good news of the gospel to all around them (2:15–16). We wonder
how we can shine like stars. We often feel inadequate and struggle to
think our “light” is bright enough to make a difference. But stars
don’t try to be stars. They just are. Light changes our world. And it
changes us. God brought physical light into our world (Genesis 1:3);
and through Jesus, God brings spiritual light into our lives (John
1:1–4).

We who have God’s light in us are to shine in such a way that those
around us see light and are drawn to its source. As effortlessly as a
star hanging in the night sky, our light makes a difference because of
what it is: Light! When we simply shine, we follow Paul’s directive to
“hold firmly to the word of life” in a world in deep darkness, and we
draw others to the source of our hope: Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, may Your light shine out of the very cracks of our beings as
we hold out the Word of life to others.

Jesus brings light into our life.
