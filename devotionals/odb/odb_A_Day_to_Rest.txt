A Day to Rest

Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work.
Exodus 23:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 23:10–13

One Sunday, I stood by the gurgling stream that wends its way through
our North London community, delighting in the beauty it brings to our
otherwise built-up area. I felt myself relax as I watched the
cascading water and listened to the birds chirping. I paused to give
the Lord thanks for how He helps us to find rest for our souls.

The Lord instituted a time of Sabbath—a time for rest and renewal—for
His people in the ancient Near East because He wanted them to thrive.
As we see in the book of Exodus, He tells them to sow their fields for
six years and rest on the seventh. So too with working six days and
resting on the seventh. His way of life set apart the Israelites from
other nations, for not only they but also the foreigners and slaves in
their households were allowed to follow this pattern.

We can approach our day of rest with expectancy and creativity,
welcoming the chance to worship and do something that feeds our souls,
which will vary according to our preferences. Some will like to play
games; some to garden; some to share a meal with friends and family;
some to take an afternoon nap.

How can we rediscover the beauty and richness of setting apart a day
to rest, if that’s missing from our lives?

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, in You we find our rest. Thank You that You’ve created us
both to work and to rest. Please help us to find the right rhythm for
our lives.

In our faith and service, rest is as important as work.
