What’s Your Passion?

Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of
the Lord our God.
Psalm 20:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 20:6–9

One of the tellers at my bank has a photograph of a Shelby Cobra
roadster on his window. (The Cobra is a high-performance automobile
built by the Ford Motor Company.)

One day, while transacting business at the bank, I asked him if that
was his car. “No,” he replied, “that’s my passion, my reason to get up
every morning and go to work. I’m going to own one someday.”

I understand this young man’s passion. A friend of mine owned a Cobra,
and I drove it on one occasion! It’s a mean machine! But a Cobra, like
everything else in this world, isn’t worth living for. Those who trust
in things apart from God “are brought to their knees and fall,”
according to the psalmist (Psalm 20:8).

That’s because we were made for God and nothing else will do—a truth
we validate in our experience every day: We buy this or that because
we think these things will make us happy, but like a child receiving a
dozen Christmas presents or more, we ask ourselves, “Is this all?”
Something is always missing.

Nothing this world has to offer us—even very good things—fully
satisfies us. There is a measure of enjoyment in them, but our
happiness soon fades away (1 John 2:17). Indeed, “God cannot give us
happiness and peace apart from Himself,” C. S. Lewis concluded. “There
is no such thing.”
