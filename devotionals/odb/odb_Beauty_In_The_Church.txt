Beauty In The Church

What does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy, and
to walk humbly with your God? —
Micah 6:8

Today's Scripture: Exodus 36:1-7

When my husband, Jay, and I decided to build a new house, we didn’t
recruit friends and family who enjoy working with power tools; instead
we hired a skilled builder to create something both functional and
beautiful.

Beauty in the church building, however, is not always a high priority.
Some associate it with impracticality, so anything ornate or
decorative is considered wasteful. But that wasn’t God’s attitude when
He established a place of worship for the ancient Israelites. He
didn’t recruit just anybody to set up an ordinary tent. He appointed
skilled craftsmen, Bezalel and Oholiab (Ex. 36:1), to decorate the
tabernacle with finely-woven tapestries and intricately designed
ornaments (37:17-20).

I think the beauty was important then because it reminded the people
of the worth of God in their worship. During the dry and dusty days of
desert wanderings, they needed a reminder of God’s majesty.

The beauty created by God’s people in worship settings today can serve
the same purpose. We offer God our best talents because He is worthy.
Beauty also gives us a glimpse of heaven and whets our appetites for
what God is preparing for our future.

Reflect & Pray

We’re saved by grace through faith alone, Good works can have no part;
But God rewards each loving deed That’s done with all our heart. —D.

Good works are not the means of salvation but the result.
