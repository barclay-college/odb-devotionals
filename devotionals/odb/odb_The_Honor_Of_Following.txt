The Honor Of Following

Then [Jesus] said to them, “Follow Me.” —
Matthew 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 4:18-22

While visiting Jerusalem, a friend of mine saw an old rabbi walking
past the Wailing Wall. The interesting thing about the aged rabbi was
the five young men walking behind him. They too were walking bent
over, limping—just like their rabbi. An Orthodox Jew watching them
would know exactly why they were imitating their teacher. They were
“followers.”

Throughout the history of Judaism, one of the most honored positions
for a Jewish man was the privilege of becoming a “follower” of the
local rabbi. Followers sat at the rabbi’s feet as he taught. They
would study his words and watch how he acted and reacted to life and
others. A follower would count it the highest honor to serve his rabbi
in even the most menial tasks. And, because they admired their rabbi,
they were determined to become like him.

When Jesus called His disciples to follow Him (Matt. 4:19), it was an
invitation to be changed by Him, to become like Him, and to share His
passion for those who need a Savior. The high honor of being His
follower should show in our lives as well. We too have been called to
catch the attention of the watching world as we talk, think, and act
just like Jesus—the rabbi, the teacher, of our souls.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for the high honor of being called to follow You. May
my life so imitate You that others will know that You are the pursuit
of my life and the rabbi of my soul.

Follow Jesus and let the world know He is your rabbi.
