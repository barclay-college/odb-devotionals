The Good, the Bad, the Ugly

Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.
Hebrews 13:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Samuel 20:35–42

A dear friend of mine sent me a text message that said, “I’m so glad
we can tell each other the good, the bad, and the ugly!” We have been
friends for many years, and we have learned to share our joys and our
failures. We recognize we are far from perfect, so we share our
struggles but we also rejoice in each other’s successes.

David and Jonathan had a solid friendship too, beginning with the good
days of David’s victory over Goliath (1 Sam. 18:1–4). They shared
their fears during the bad days of Jonathan’s father’s jealousy
(18:6–11; 20:1–2). Finally, they suffered together during the ugly
days of Saul’s plans to kill David (20:42).

Good friends don’t abandon us when external circumstances change. They
stay with us through the good and the bad days. Good friends also may
point us to God in the ugly days, when we may feel tempted to walk
away from our Lord.

Real friendships are a gift from God because they exemplify the
perfect Friend, who remains loyal through the good, the bad, and the
ugly days. As the Lord reminds us, “Never will I leave you; never will
I forsake you” (Heb. 13:5).
