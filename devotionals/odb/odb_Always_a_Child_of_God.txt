Always a Child of God

For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.
Romans 8:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 8:9–17

During a church service I attended with my parents, according to the
usual practice we held hands while saying the Lord’s Prayer together.
As I stood with one hand clasped to my mother’s and the other to my
father’s, I was struck by the thought that I will always be their
daughter. Although I’m firmly in my middle age, I can still be called
“the child of Leo and Phyllis.” I reflected that not only am I their
daughter, but I will also always be a child of God.

The apostle Paul wanted the people in the church at Rome to understand
that their identity was based on being adopted members of God’s family
(Romans 8:15). Because they had been born of the Spirit (v. 14), no
longer did they need to be enslaved to things that didn’t really
matter. Rather, through the gift of the Spirit, they were “heirs of
God and co-heirs with Christ” (v. 17).

To those who follow Christ, what difference does this make? Quite
simply, everything! Our identity as children of God provides our
foundation and shapes how we see ourselves and the world. For
instance, knowing that we are part of God’s family helps us to step
out of our comfort zone as we follow Him. We can also be free from
seeking the approval of others.

Today, why not ponder what it means to be God’s child?

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, help me to live out of my central identity as Your child.
Release me to live by Your Spirit, that I might share Your love and
hope.

Those who follow God are His children.
