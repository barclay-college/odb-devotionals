Even If

The God we serve is able to deliver us from [the fire] . . . . But
even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will
not serve your gods.
Daniel 3:17–18

Today's Scripture: Daniel 3:8–18

Sometimes life deals us a tremendous blow. Other times the miraculous
happens.

Three young men, captives in Babylon, stood in front of the fearsome
king of that land and boldly proclaimed that under no circumstances
would they worship the giant image of gold towering above them.
Together they declared: “If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,
the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us
from Your Majesty’s hand. But even if he does not, we want you to know
. . . we will not . . . worship the image” (Daniel 3:17–18).

These three men—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—were hurled into the
fiery furnace; and God miraculously delivered them so that not a hair
of their head was singed and their clothing was smoke-free (vv.
19–27). They had been prepared to die but their trust in God was
unwavering—“even if” He had not saved them.

God desires that we cling to Him—even if our loved one isn’t healed,
even if we lose our job, even if we are persecuted. Sometimes God
rescues us from danger in this life, and sometimes He doesn’t. But the
truth we can hold firmly is this: “The God we serve is able,” loves
us, and is with us in every fiery trial, every even if.

Dear Lord, we love You! Please give us unwavering faith—and strength
and hope for each day—no matter the circumstance.

God is able.
