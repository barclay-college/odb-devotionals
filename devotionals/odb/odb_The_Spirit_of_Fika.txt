The Spirit of Fika

When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke
it and began to give it to them.
Luke 24:30

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 24:28–35

The coffeehouse in the town near my house is named Fika. It’s a
Swedish word meaning to take a break with coffee and a pastry, always
with family, co-workers, or friends. I’m not Swedish, yet the spirit
of fika describes one thing I love most about Jesus—His practice of
taking a break to eat and relax with others.

Scholars say Jesus’s meals weren’t random. Theologian Mark Glanville
calls them “the delightful ‘second course’” of Israel’s feasts and
celebrations in the Old Testament. At the table, Jesus lived what God
had intended Israel to be: “a center of joy, celebration and justice
for the whole world.”

From the feeding of 5,000, to the Last Supper—even to the meal with
two believers after His resurrection (Luke 24:30)—the table ministry
of Jesus invites us to stop our constant striving and abide in Him.
Indeed, not until eating with Jesus did the two believers recognize
Him as the risen Lord. “He took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began
to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened” (vv. 30–31) to the
living Christ.

Sitting with a friend recently at Fika, enjoying hot chocolate and
rolls, we found ourselves also talking of Jesus. He is the Bread of
Life. May we linger at His table and find more of Him.
