Life Changes

Put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and
holiness.
Ephesians 4:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:20–24

Stephen grew up in a rough part of East London and fell into crime by
the age of ten. He said, “If everyone’s selling drugs and doing
robberies and fraud, then you’re going to get involved. It’s just a
way of life.” But when he was twenty, he had a dream that changed him:
“I heard God saying, Stephen, you’re going to prison for murder.” This
vivid dream served as a warning, and he turned to God and received
Jesus as his Savior—and the Holy Spirit transformed his life.

Stephen set up an organization that teaches inner-city kids
discipline, morality, and respect through sports. He credits God with
the success he has seen as he prays with and trains the kids.
“Rebuilding misguided dreams,” he says.

In pursuing God and leaving behind our past, we—like Stephen—follow
Paul’s charge to the Ephesians to embrace a new way of life. Although
our old self is “corrupted by its deceitful desires,” we can daily
seek to “put on the new self” that’s created to be like God (Ephesians
4:22, 24). All believers embrace this continual process as we ask God
through His Holy Spirit to make us more like Him.

Stephen said, “Faith was a crucial foundation for me changing my life
around.” How has this been true for you?

Reflect & Pray

When you look back over your life, what comes to mind as key moments
that prompted change? What long-lasting change resulted?

Jesus, You’re alive and working in the world and in my life. Help
me become more like You day by day as I leave the old self behind.
