The Overflow

Forget not all His benefits. —
Psalm 103:2

Today's Scripture: Psalm 103:1-10

Joyful shouts filtered into our house from outside and I wanted to
know what was so wonderful out there. I peeked through the curtains
and watched two young boys splashing in a thick stream of water that
gushed from a fire hydrant.

The overflow reminded me of how God pours out blessings on His
children, and how important it is to recognize that “the Lord . . .
daily loads us with benefits” (Ps. 68:19).

Although I know He has furnished countless good things for me, when
the car blows a gasket, when the flu infects my family, and when
relationships threaten to unravel, dissatisfaction threatens my view
of God’s blessings—they seem more like infrequent drips from a faucet
rather than a flood of water from a hydrant!

Maybe that’s why in Psalm 103 David reminds us to “forget not all His
benefits” (v.2). And then, to help us, he lists a torrent of blessings
for believers. He reminds us that God forgives all our iniquities,
heals all our diseases, redeems our lives from destruction, crowns us
with lovingkindness, and satisfies our mouths with good things
(vv.3-5).

Today, let’s take time to acknowledge God’s abundance instead of
overlooking the overflow of His blessings.

Reflect & Pray

We’re loaded with benefits daily, Sent down from the Father above; His
mercies and blessings abounding Are gifts of His marvelous love.

Adding up your blessings will multiply your joy.
