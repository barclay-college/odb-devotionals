All The Comforts Of Home

In My Father’s house are many mansions; . . . I go to prepare a place
for you. —
John 14:2

Today's Scripture: John 14:1-6

Once, during my tenure as a human resource officer for a construction
company, we took some jobs in a neighboring state. This meant our
workers were faced with a 2-hour commute each way, plus a full
workday. To ease the burden, we booked motel rooms for the week, but
we also arranged vans and drivers to transport those who decided to
commute. Almost every worker took the vans!

One of our grumpiest workers discarded his usual demeanor as he
described the thrill and surprise of his wife and four boys on the
first night. He hadn’t told them he had an option to come home, so he
showed up unexpectedly to surprise them. Later his wife called to
thank the company owner, telling him their family was “loyal for life”
to anyone who understood how important home was to workers.

Anyone who has been deprived of home, even for a short time, will
understand the comfort Jesus’ disciples drew from His words when He
promised that an eternal home awaited them (John 14:2). Then, to make
their joy complete, Jesus told them He would prepare and guide them to
that home, and, joy of joys, He would be there too (v.3).

Remember the greatest comfort of this life: Jesus promised that one
day we will go home to be with Him.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, we praise You for these words from Jesus that touch
the deepest longing in our soul—the hope and comfort of home. We want
to be with You. In Jesus’ name, amen.

There is no place like home— especially when home is heaven.
