The Smiling Jesus

God . . . has set you above your companions by anointing you with the
oil of joy.
Hebrews 1:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 1:8–12

If you were to play the part of Jesus in a movie, how would you
approach the role? That was the challenge faced by Bruce Marchiano,
who played Jesus in the 1993 Visual Bible movie Matthew. Knowing that
millions of viewers would draw conclusions about Jesus based on his
work, the weight of getting Christ “right” felt overwhelming. He fell
to his knees in prayer and begged Jesus for—well, for Jesus.

Bruce gained insight from the first chapter of Hebrews, where the
writer tells us how God the Father set the Son apart by anointing Him
“with the oil of joy” (1:9). This kind of joy is one of celebration—a
gladness of connection to the Father expressed wholeheartedly. Such
joy ruled in Jesus’ heart throughout His life. As Hebrews 12:2
describes it, “For the joy set before him he endured the cross,
scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of
God.”

Taking his cue from this scriptural expression, Bruce offered a
uniquely joy-filled portrayal of his Savior. As a result, he became
known as “the smiling Jesus.” We too can dare to fall to our knees and
“beg Jesus for Jesus.” May He so fill us with His character that
people around us see the expression of His love in us!

Reflect & Pray

What are your perceptions of Jesus and how might they need to change?
How can you represent Him as you show His heart to the world?

Dear Jesus, we beg You for You. May Your heart be what others see in
us today. May we radiate Your joy in all we say and do.
