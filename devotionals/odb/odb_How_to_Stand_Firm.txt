How to Stand Firm

To him who is able to keep you from stumbling.
Jude 1:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jude 1:24–25

It was a cold, icy winter’s day, and my mind was focused on getting
from my warm vehicle to a warm building. The next thing I knew I was
on the ground, my knees turned inward and my lower legs turned
outward. Nothing was broken, but I was in pain. The pain would get
worse as time went by and it would be weeks before I was whole again.

Who among us hasn’t taken a spill of some sort? Wouldn’t it be nice to
have something or someone to keep us on our feet all the time? While
there are no guarantees of surefootedness in the physical sense, there
is One who stands ready to assist us in our quest to honor Christ in
this life and prepare us to stand joyfully before Him in the next.

Every day we face temptations (and even false teachings) that seek to
divert us, confuse us, and entangle us. Yet, it’s not ultimately
through our own efforts that we remain on our feet as we walk in this
world. How assuring to know that when we hold our peace when tempted
to speak angrily, to opt for honesty over deceit, to choose love over
hate, or to select truth over error—we experience God’s power to keep
us standing (Jude 1:24). And when we appear approved before God when
Christ returns, the praise that we offer now for His sustaining grace
will echo throughout eternity (v. 25).
