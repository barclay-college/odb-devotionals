Self-Destructive Hatred

Repay no one evil for evil. —
Romans 12:17

Today's Scripture: Esther 7:1-10

George Washington Carver (1864–1943) overcame terrible racial
prejudice to establish himself as a renowned American educator.
Spurning the temptation to give in to bitterness for the way he was
treated, Carver wisely wrote, “Hate within will eventually destroy the
hater.”

In the book of Esther, we see how self-destructive hatred can be.
Mordecai, a Jew, refused to bow down before Haman—a self-important
dignitary in the Persian court. This angered Haman, who manipulated
information to make Mordecai and his people appear as threats to the
empire (3:8-9). When his scheming was complete, Haman called on the
Persian king to kill all the Jews. The king proclaimed an edict to
that effect, but before it could be carried out, Esther intervened and
Haman’s devious plot was revealed (7:1-6). Enraged, the king had Haman
executed on gallows the schemer had built for Mordecai (7:7-10).

Carver’s words and Haman’s actions remind us that hatred is self-
destructive. The biblical response is to turn hatred around and return
good for evil. “Repay no one evil for evil,” Paul said (Rom. 12:17).
When offended, “do not avenge yourselves” (v.19). Instead, do what is
right (v.17) that you may live “peaceably with all men” (v.18).

Harboring hatred in the heart Will not lead to success; But following
truth and love and grace Will lead to blessedness. —Hess

Hatred promotes self-destruction; love fulfills Christ’s instruction.
