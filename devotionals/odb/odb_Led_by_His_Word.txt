Led by His Word

Direct my footsteps according to your word; let no sin rule over me.
Psalm 119:133

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:1, 133–136

At the BBC in London, Paul Arnold’s first broadcasting job was making
“walking sounds” in radio dramas. While actors read from scripts
during a walking scene, Paul as stage manager made corresponding
sounds with his feet—careful to match his pace to the actor’s voice
and spoken lines. The key challenge, he explained, was yielding to the
actor in the story, “so the two of us were working together.”

A divine version of such cooperation was sought by the author of Psalm
119, which emphasizes living by the precepts of God’s Word. As Psalm
119:1 says, “Blessed are those whose ways are blameless, who walk
according to the law of the Lord .” Led this way by God and following
His instructions, we can remain pure (v. 9), overcome scorn (v. 22),
and escape greed (v. 36). He will enable us to resist sin (v. 61),
find godly friends (v. 63), and live in joy (v. 111).

Theologian Charles Bridges commented on verse 133: “When I take
therefore a step into the world, let me ask—Is it ordered in God’s
word, which exhibits Christ as my perfect example?”

Walking this way, we show the world Jesus. May He help us walk so
closely with Him that people glimpse in us our Leader, Friend, and
Savior!
