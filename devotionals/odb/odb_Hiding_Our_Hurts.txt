Hiding Our Hurts

The word of God . . . judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
Hebrews 4:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 4:12–13

I was guest-speaking in a local church and my topic was an honest
story about presenting our brokenness before God and receiving the
healing He wants to give. Before closing in prayer, the pastor stood
in the center aisle, looked deeply into the eyes of his gathered
congregants, and said, “As your pastor I have the privilege of seeing
you midweek and hearing your heart-breaking stories of brokenness.
Then in our weekend worship services, I have the pain of watching you
hide your hurt away.”

My heart ached at the hidden hurts God came to heal. The writer of
Hebrews describes the Word of God as alive and active. Many have
understood this “word” to be the Bible, but it’s even more than that.
Jesus is the living Word of God. He evaluates our thoughts and
attitudes—and loves us still.

Jesus died to give us access to God’s presence, all the time. And
while we all know it’s not wise to share everything with everyone, we
also know that God intends His church be a place where we can live
unapologetically as broken and forgiven followers of Christ. It’s to
be a place where we “carry each other’s burdens” (Galatians 6:2).

What are you hiding from others today? And how are you trying to hide
from God as well? God sees us through Jesus. And He still loves us.
Will we let Him?

Who will you prayerfully consider letting help you carry your burdens?

God sees us with the eyes of a Father.
