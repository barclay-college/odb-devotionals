Mysterious Detours

Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them. —
Psalm 22:4

Today's Scripture: Genesis 12:1-10; 13:1

Before my wife and I embarked on a 400-mile road trip, I set up the
GPS with our daughter’s home in Missouri as the destination. As we
traveled through Illinois, the GPS instructed us to get off the
Interstate, resulting in a detour through the city of Harvey. After
the GPS directed us back to I-80, I was baffled by this mysterious
detour. Why were we directed off a perfectly good highway?

I’ll never know the answer. We continued on our way, and we trusted
the GPS to get us there and home again.

That got me to thinking about detours in life. We may seem to be
traveling on a smooth pathway. Then for some reason, God redirects us
into an unfamiliar area. Perhaps it is an illness, or a crisis at work
or school, or an unexpected tragedy occurs. We don’t understand what
God is doing.

Abraham faced a mysterious detour when God told him, “Get out of your
country, from your family and from your father’s house” (Gen. 12:1).
Surely Abraham must have wondered why God was routing him to the Negev
desert. But he trusted God and His good purposes.

A GPS may make mistakes, but we can trust our unfailing God (Ps.
22:4). He will guide us through all our mysterious detours and lead us
where He wants us to go.

Reflect & Pray

We seek Your guidance, Lord, but we understand that our path won’t
always be without challenges. Help us to trust You through the
detours—knowing that You have our best interests and Your honor at
heart.

We don’t need to see the way when we stay close to the One who does.
