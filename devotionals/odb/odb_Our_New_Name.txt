Our New Name

I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on
it.
Revelation 2:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 2:12–17

She called herself a worrier, but when her child was hurt in an
accident, she learned how to escape that restricting label. As her
child was recovering, she met each week with friends to talk and pray,
asking God for help and healing. Through the months as she turned her
fears and concerns into prayer, she realized that she was changing
from being a worrier to a prayer warrior. She sensed that the Lord was
giving her a new name. Her identity in Christ was deepening through
the struggle of unwanted heartache.

In Jesus’s letter to the church at Pergamum, the Lord promises to give
to the faithful a white stone with a new name on it (Rev. 2:17).
Biblical commentators have debated over the meaning, but most agree
that this white stone points to our freedom in Christ. In biblical
times, juries in a court of law used a white stone for a not-guilty
verdict and a black stone for guilty. A white stone also gained the
bearer entrance into such events as banquets; likewise, those who
receive God’s white stone are welcomed to the heavenly feast. Jesus’s
death brings us freedom and new life—and a new name.

What new name do you think God might give to you?
