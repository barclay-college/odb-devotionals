The Good Life

It is good for me to draw near to God. —
Psalm 73:28

Today's Scripture: Psalm 73:21-28

Beauty, wealth, power, love, marriage, and pleasure are good things,
but they’re not the best. The best is loving God and taking in His
love—bringing Him glory and making Him our friend for life. That leads
to the best possible life because it gives us satisfaction and joy now
(John 10:10), and it’s what Christians are going to be doing forever.

That’s why we should make time for God and rest in His love—the love
that made you and me. It is the reason for our existence and the means
by which we will make the most of our lives.

I like the way the psalmist put it: “It is good for me to draw near to
God; I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all Your
works” (Ps. 73:28). In other words, the good life is drawing close to
the One who loves us like no other.

And how can we “draw close” to Him? Here’s a practice I began many
years ago: Take a few minutes every morning to read some verses from
the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) and note what Jesus said or
did. After all, He came to show us what God is like (Heb. 1:1-3). Put
yourself in the story—in the place of the leper He healed with His
loving touch, for example (Mark 1:40-45). Think about how much He
loves you and then thank Him!

Reflect & Pray

Perfect submission, all is at rest, I in my Savior am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above, Filled with His goodness, lost in
His love. —Crosby

The wonder of it all— just to think that Jesus loves me!
