The Obedience Factor

Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all
righteousness. —
Matthew 3:15

Today's Scripture: Matthew 3:13-17

Dewey VanderVelde refused to be baptized. He steadfastly resisted,
even when his wife and daughters were baptized one Sunday afternoon.

Years later, his pastor preached on the baptism of Jesus. He pointed
out that John the Baptist initially refused to baptize Jesus, but
Jesus said, “It is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness”
(Matthew 3:15). The pastor then added this comment: “If Jesus obeyed
the will of the Father, so should we.”

After the message, Dewey asked to be baptized. He said that he should
have obeyed the Lord’s command much sooner, and he regretted having
been so stubborn.

The issue, of course, was more than just baptism; it was obedience.
The same may be true for us. We may be stubbornly disobeying the Lord
in a certain area of our life—lying, cheating, stealing at work, not
giving to the Lord.

Here’s what we must face: Jesus obeyed the Father in everything. His
submission took Him from the height of popularity to abandonment. It
took Him from public adoration to solitary suffering. It took Him to
Pilate’s judgment hall, the terrible road to Calvary, the cross, and
the tomb.

Let it be today that we willingly decide to obey the Lord in
everything.

Reflect & Pray

O give us strength to quench the urge To do things our own way; And
help us, Lord, to heed Your Word, Its precepts to obey. —Sper

True faith will obey without delay.
