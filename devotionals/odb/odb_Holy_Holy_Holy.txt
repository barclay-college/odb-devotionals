Holy, Holy, Holy

They do not rest day or night, saying: “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
Almighty, who was and is and is to come!” —
Revelation 4:8

Today's Scripture: Revelation 4

“Time flies when you’re having fun.” This cliché has no basis in fact,
but experience makes it seem true.

When life is pleasant, time passes all too quickly. Give me a task
that I enjoy, or a person whose company I love, and time seems
irrelevant.

My experience of this “reality” has given me a new understanding of
the scene described in Revelation 4. In the past, when I considered
the four living creatures seated around God’s throne who keep
repeating the same few words, I thought, What a boring existence!

I don’t think that anymore. I think about the scenes they have
witnessed with their many eyes (v.8). I consider the view they have
from their position around God’s throne (v.6). I think of how amazed
they are at God’s wise and loving involvement with wayward earthlings.
Then I think, What better response could there be? What else is there
to say but, “Holy, holy, holy”?

Is it boring to say the same words over and over? Not when you’re in
the presence of the one you love. Not when you’re doing exactly what
you were designed to do.

Like the four creatures, we were designed to glorify God. Our lives
will never be boring if we’re focusing our attention on Him and
fulfilling that purpose.

Reflect & Pray

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning our song
shall rise to Thee; Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty! God in
three Persons, blessed Trinity! —Heber

A heart in tune with God can’t help but sing His praise.
