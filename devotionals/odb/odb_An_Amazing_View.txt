An Amazing View

From the place of His dwelling He looks on all the inhabitants of the
earth. —
Psalm 33:14

Today's Scripture: Psalm 33:13-22

From my home in Colorado, I recently used Google Maps to “wander
around” the neighborhood in Nairobi, Kenya, where my family lived 2
decades ago. A satellite image on my computer screen enabled me to
identify roads, landmarks, and buildings. In some cases, I got a
street-level view, as if I were standing on the ground there.

It was quite a view, but only a small taste of how the Lord must see
our world.

The psalmist celebrated God’s view by writing these words: “The Lord
looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men. . . . He considers all
their works. . . . The eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him, on
those who hope in His mercy, to deliver their soul from death, and to
keep them alive in famine” (33:13-19).

Unlike an unfeeling satellite, the Lord sees with His heart of love as
He considers who we are and what we do. The Bible reveals that He
longs for us to trust Him and follow His way. We are never out of
God’s sight, and He keeps a close eye on everyone whose hope is in
Him.

For all who know the Lord through faith in Jesus Christ, it’s
encouraging to realize that every day we’re part of His amazing view.

Reflect & Pray

Beneath His watchful eye His saints securely dwell; That hand which
bears all nature up Shall guard His children well. —Doddridge

Keep your eyes on God; He never takes His eyes off you.
