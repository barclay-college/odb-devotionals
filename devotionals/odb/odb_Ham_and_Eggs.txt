Ham and Eggs

The eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those
whose hearts are fully committed to him.
2 Chronicles 16:9

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 16:1–9

In the fable of the chicken and the pig, the two animals discuss
opening a restaurant together. As they plan their menu, the chicken
suggests they serve ham and eggs. The pig swiftly objects saying, “No
thanks. I’d be committed, but you would only be involved.”

Although the pig didn’t care to put himself on the platter, his
understanding of commitment is instructive to me as I learn to better
follow God with my whole heart.

To protect his kingdom, Asa, king of Judah, sought to break up a
treaty between the kings of Israel and Aram. To accomplish this, he
sent personal treasure along with “silver and gold out of the
treasuries of the L ord ’s temple” to secure favor with Ben-Hadad, the
king of Aram (2 Chron. 16:2). Ben-Hadad agreed and their joint forces
repelled Israel.

But God’s prophet Hanani called Asa foolish for relying on human help
instead of God who had delivered other enemies into their hands.
Hanani asserted, “The eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to
strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him” (v. 9).

As we face our own battles and challenges, let’s remember that God is
our best ally. He strengthens us when we’re willing to “serve up” a
whole-hearted commitment to Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I want to rely on You more fully. Sometimes I see only what is
around me. Please help me to look up and to trust You more.

When we are abandoned to God, He works through us all the time. Oswald
