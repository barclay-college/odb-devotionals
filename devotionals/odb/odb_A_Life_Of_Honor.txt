A Life Of Honor

Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who delights greatly in His
commandments. —
Psalm 112:1

Today's Scripture: Psalm 112

In 2010, my brothers and I celebrated our dad’s 90th birthday. We
hosted an open house with great food and fellowship. In the living
room, family and friends took up banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle,
upright bass, and Irish drum to play and sing all afternoon. A big
cake was prepared with this written on it in frosting: “Praise the
Lord! Blessed is the man who fears the Lord—Psalm 112:1. Happy 90th
birthday, Hal.”

When I later examined Psalm 112, I was impressed with how it seemed to
describe my dad—who had walked with God for more than 50 years and is
now at home with Him. Dad had his own share of heartaches and faults,
but his steadfast faith resulted in much blessing. This psalm tells us
that blessings will fall on the man who has a reverential fear of God
and who delights in His commands. In response to this growing
integrity and faith, God will extend blessing not only to the believer
but also to his children (v.2).

This psalm challenges us to reflect an inner reverence for God and to
make continual decisions to delight in following His commands. If we
do that, then as we look back on our years—no matter how many or how
few—we will know that God has helped us live a life of honor.

Reflect & Pray

When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word, What a glory He
sheds on our way! While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey. —Sammis

If you honor God in your heart, He will be honored by your life.
