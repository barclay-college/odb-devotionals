Keep Me From Wrath

Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. —
Psalm 37:8

Today's Scripture: Psalm 37:8-11

I have a friend whose note cards are imprinted with a picture of
Rodin’s The Thinker, the famous sculpture depicting a man in sober
reflection. Below the picture is this inscription: “Life is not fair.”

Indeed, it is not. And any theory that insists that this life is fair
is illusory and deceptive.

Despite the overwhelming unfairness of life, however, David in Psalm
37 prays that he will not retaliate but will instead rest in the Lord
and wait patiently for Him to bring justice to the earth in due time
(v.7). “For evildoers shall be cut off; but those who wait on the
Lord, they shall inherit the earth” (v.9).

Our wrath tends to be vindictive and punitive. God’s wrath is
untainted by self-interest and tempered by mercy. His wrath can even
be His relentless love that brings our antagonists to repentance and
faith. We must not then avenge ourselves, “for it is written,
‘Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,’ says the Lord . . . . Do not be
overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good” (Rom. 12:19,21).

This must begin in the heart, the wellspring from which the issues of
our lives flow. May we cease from anger, forsake wrath, and wait
patiently for the Lord.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me not retaliate When someone wants to pick a fight;
Instead, give me the strength and faith To show Your love and do
what’s right. —Sper

Revenge restrained is a victory gained.
