Photobombing Jesus

He must become greater; I must become less.
John 3:30

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 3:26–36

When my pastor asked our class a difficult question about the life of
Jesus, my hand shot up. I had just read the story, so I knew this one.
And I wanted the others in the room to know that I knew it too. After
all, I’m a Bible teacher. How embarrassing it would be to be stumped
in front of them! Now I was embarrassed by my fear of embarrassment.
So I lowered my hand. Am I this insecure?

John the Baptist shows a better way. When his disciples complained
that people were beginning to leave him and follow Jesus, John said he
was glad to hear it. He was merely the messenger. “I am not the
Messiah but am sent ahead of him. . . . He must become greater; I must
become less” (3:28–30). John realized the point of his existence was
Jesus. He is “the one who comes from heaven” and “is above all” (v.
31)—the divine Son who gave His life for us. He must receive all the
glory and fame.

Any attention drawn to ourselves distracts from God. And since He is
our only Savior and the only hope for the world, any credit we steal
from Him ends up hurting us.

Let’s resolve to step out of the picture—to stop photobombing Jesus.
It’s best for Him, for the world, and for us.

Reflect & Pray

When are you tempted to share the spotlight with Jesus? How can you
turn the attention to where it belongs?

Heavenly Father, help us understand that our task is to direct
everyone’s attention to Your Son, so that He increasingly fills up the
frame. Help us see that we must decrease and He must increase.
