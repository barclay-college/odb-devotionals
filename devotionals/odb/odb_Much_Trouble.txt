Much Trouble

I will not leave you nor forsake you. —
Joshua 1:5

Today's Scripture: Joshua 1:1-7

A young boy named Riley started a fight with Avery on the school
playground after a soccer match. The teacher broke it up, and both
boys were sent to the principal’s office. Later, Avery said, “And of
course, like always, we both got in trouble.” But he shared that he
learned a lesson: “God is always with us, even if we get in as much
trouble as this.”

The nation of Israel was in big trouble. Yet the Lord promised the
nation’s new leader: “I will not leave you nor forsake you” (Josh.
1:5). Joshua was taking over leadership of the Israelites after Moses’
death, just before they were to enter the Promised Land. Trouble was
on the horizon with numerous military campaigns against their enemies
coming up (8:3; 9:1-2). Without God’s presence, they couldn’t begin to
acquire the land.

Joshua had a strong faith in the Lord, as seen when he spied out the
land of Canaan (Num. 14:6-9). But God graciously gave him the reminder
as he took over the leadership role that he could be courageous
because of His presence. He promises the same to His children today
(Heb. 13:5-6).

It’s a comforting lesson for God’s children of all ages to know: The
Lord is always with us. Even when we’re in “as much trouble as this.”

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, we’re so thankful to be Your children, and that You’ll
never leave us. Help us to hold on to that promise when trouble seems
to threaten on every side. Amen.

When troubles call on you, call on God.
