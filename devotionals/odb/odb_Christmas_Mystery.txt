Christmas Mystery

The mystery from which true godliness springs is great.
1 Timothy 3:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Timothy 3:14-16

As Charles Dickens’ story A Christmas Carol begins, there is mystery
surrounding Ebenezer Scrooge. Why is he so mean-spirited? How did he
become so selfish? Then, slowly, as the Christmas spirits marched
Scrooge through his own story, things become clearer. We see the
influences that changed him from a happy youth into a selfish miser.
We observe his isolation and his brokenness. As the mystery is solved,
we also glimpse the path to restoration. Concern for others pulls
Scrooge from his self-absorbed darkness into a new joy.

A far more important mystery, and one much harder to explain, is that
which Paul spoke of in 1 Timothy 3:16: “Beyond all question, the
mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the
flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached
among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in
glory.” Extraordinary! God “appeared in the flesh.”

The mystery of Christmas is how God could become man while remaining
fully God. It defies human explanation, but in the perfect wisdom of
God, it was the plan of the ages.

“What child is this?” He is Jesus Christ—God revealed in the flesh.
