The God Who Paints

My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
Psalm 42:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 42

Nezahualcoyotl (1402–1472) may have had a difficult name to pronounce,
but his name is full of significance. It means “Hungry Coyote,” and
this man’s writings show a spiritual hunger. As a poet and ruler in
Mexico before the arrival of the Europeans, he wrote, “Truly the gods,
which I worship, are idols of stone that do not speak nor feel. . . .
Some very powerful, hidden and unknown god is the creator of the
entire universe. He is the only one that can console me in my
affliction and help me in such anguish as my heart feels; I want him
to be my helper and protection.”

We cannot know if Nezahualcoyotl found the Giver of life. But during
his reign he built a pyramid to the “God who paints things with
beauty,” and he banned human sacrifices in his city.

The writers of Psalm 42 cried out, “My soul thirsts for God, for the
living God” (v. 2). Every human being desires the true God, just as
“the deer pants for streams of water” (v. 1).

Today there are many Hungry Coyotes who know that the idols of fame,
money, and relationships can’t fill the void in their souls. The
Living God has revealed Himself through Jesus, the only One who gives
us meaning and fulfillment. This is good news for those who are hungry
for the God who paints things with beauty.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You are the One my soul needs. Only You can bring meaning and
fulfillment to my life. You are the One my heart cries out for. I put
my hope in You.

Beneath all of our longings is a deep desire for God.
