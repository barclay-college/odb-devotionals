Left Side Of The Road

For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall
love your neighbor as yourself.” —
Galatians 5:14

Today's Scripture: Galatians 5:1-14

Growing up in the US, I always thought it interesting that in some
countries motorists drive on the left side of the road instead of the
right. Then, when I was in England, I heard a London tour guide
explain one possible reason for this law: “In the 1800s, pedestrians
as well as horse-and-carriages used the same roads. When a carriage
was on the right side of the road, a driver’s horse whip would
sometimes hit a passerby. To remove this hazard, a law was passed
requiring all carriages to travel on the left side of the road so the
pedestrians could be kept safe.”

Just as the rules of the road are for our benefit and protection, so
are God’s commands. Because He loves us, He has given them to us for
our benefit. Paul writes: “For you, brethren, have been called to
liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but
through love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one
word, even in this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself’” (Gal.
5:13-14).

As we apply God’s Word to our hearts, let’s keep in mind that the God
of grace has given us His guidelines to help us grow in our love for
Him and our concern for others.
