Trust Me

Do not worry about tomorrow.
Matthew 6:34

Today's Scripture: 1 Kings 17:7–16

After graduation from college, I had a low-paying job. Money was
tight, and sometimes I didn’t even have enough for my next meal. I
learned to trust God for my daily provision.

It reminded me of the prophet Elijah’s experience. During his
prophetic ministry, he learned to trust God to meet his daily needs.
Shortly after Elijah pronounced God’s judgment of a drought in Israel,
God sent him to a deserted place, Kerith Ravine, where He used the
ravens to bring Elijah his daily meals and refresh him with water from
the brook (1 Kings 17:1–4).

But a drought occurred. The brook shrank to a tiny stream, and slowly
became a mere trickle. It was only when the brook had dried up that
God said: “Go at once to Zarephath . . . . I have directed a
widow there to supply you with food” (v. 9). Zarephath was in
Phoenicia, whose inhabitants were enemies of the Israelites. Would
anyone offer Elijah shelter? And would a poor widow have food to
share?

Most of us would rather God provided in abundance long before our
resources were depleted rather than just enough for each day. But our
loving Father whispers, Trust Me. Just as He used ravens and a widow
to provide for Elijah, nothing is impossible for Him. We can count on
His love and power to meet our daily needs.

Reflect & Pray

Faithful Father, thank You for knowing exactly what we need before we
even ask. Help us to trust You for our daily needs.

God supplies all our needs—one day at a time.
