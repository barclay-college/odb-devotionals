When God Cleans House

Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put
away from you, with all malice. —
Ephesians 4:31

Today's Scripture: Jonah 1

God did some fall housecleaning this week. He sent a mighty wind
through our neighborhood that made the trees tremble and shake loose
their dead branches. When it finished, I had a mess to clean up.

In my own life, God sometimes works in a similar way. He will send or
allow stormy circumstances that shake loose the “lifeless branches”
I’ve been refusing to release. Sometimes it’s something that once was
good, like an area of ministry, but is no longer bearing fruit. More
often it’s something that’s not good, like a bad habit I’ve slid into
or a stubborn attitude that prevents new growth.

The Old Testament prophet Jonah discovered what can happen when one
refuses to get rid of a stubborn attitude. His hatred for the
Ninevites was stronger than his love for God, so God sent a great
storm that landed Jonah in a giant fish (Jonah 1:4,17). God preserved
the reluctant prophet in that unlikely place and gave him a second
chance to obey (2:10; 3:1-3).

The lifeless limbs in my yard caused me to think of attitudes that God
expects me to dispose of. Paul’s letter to the Ephesians lists some of
them: bitterness, anger, and evil speech (4:31). When God shakes
things up, we need to get rid of what He shakes loose.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give me a listening heart and help me to cooperate with You when
You point out changes that need to be made in my life. I want to honor
You and please You. Amen.

Christ’s cleansing power can remove the most stubborn stain of sin.
