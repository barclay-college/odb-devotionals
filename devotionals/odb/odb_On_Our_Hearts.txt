On Our Hearts

These commandments . . . are to be on your hearts. Impress them on
your children.
Deuteronomy 6:6–7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 6:1–9

After a young boy faced some challenges in school, his dad began to
teach him a pledge to recite each morning before school: “I thank God
for waking me up today. I am going to school so I can learn . . . and
be the leader that God has created me to be.” The pledge is one way
the father hopes to help his son apply himself and deal with life’s
inevitable challenges.

In a way, by helping his son to commit this pledge to memory, the
father is doing something similar to what God commanded the Israelites
in the desert: “These commandments . . . are to be on your hearts.
Impress them on your children” (Deuteronomy 6:6–7).

After wandering in the wilderness for forty years, the next generation
of Israelites was about to enter the Promised Land. God knew it
wouldn’t be easy for them to succeed—unless they kept their focus on
Him. And so, through Moses, He urged them to remember and be obedient
to Him—and to help their children to know and love God by talking
about His Word “when you sit at home and when you walk along the road,
when you lie down and when you get up” (v. 7).

Each new day, we too can commit to allowing Scripture to guide our
hearts and minds as we live in gratitude to Him.
