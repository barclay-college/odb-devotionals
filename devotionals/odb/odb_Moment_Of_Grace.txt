Moment Of Grace

Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the
things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them. —
Luke 2:20

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:13-20

Every year, I enjoy listening to the BBC’s worldwide live radio
broadcast of the Christmas Eve service from King’s College Chapel in
Cambridge, England. This Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols combines
Scripture readings, prayers, and choral music in a moving service of
worship. One year, I was struck by the announcer’s description of the
congregation leaving the magnificent chapel, saying they were
“stepping out of this moment of grace and back into the real world.”

Wasn’t it that way on the first Christmas? The shepherds heard an
angel announce the birth of the Savior, Christ the Lord (Luke 2:11),
followed by a “multitude of the heavenly host praising God”
(vv.13-14). After they found Mary, Joseph, and the Baby in Bethlehem,
the shepherds couldn’t help telling others about this Child (v.17).
“The shepherds went back to work, glorifying and praising God for
everything that they had heard and seen, which had happened just as
they had been told” (v.20 Phillips).

They had been changed by their “moment of grace.” As they stepped back
into their real world, they carried the good news about Jesus in their
hearts and voices.

May we too take God’s grace into the real world this Christmas and
every day of the new year.

Reflect & Pray

May the grace that we encounter At this time of Christmas cheer Not be
true just in this season But remain throughout the year. —Sper

Take the joy of Christmas with you every day.
