One Amazing Letter

I will not forget Your word. —
Psalm 119:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:9-16

Once in a while my wife and I open the mail to find a letter with no
words on it. When we take the “letter” out of the envelope, we see a
piece of paper with nothing more on it than a colorful mark made with
a felt pen. Those “letters” warm our hearts because they’re from our
preschool granddaughter Katie, who lives in another state. Even
without words, these letters tell us that she loves us and is thinking
about us.

We all cherish letters from those we love and those who love us.
That’s why there is so much encouragement in the fact that our
heavenly Father has given us a letter called the Bible. The value of
Scripture goes beyond its words of power, challenge, and wisdom. Amid
all of the stories, teaching, and guidance this Book provides, the
overriding idea is that God loves us and has planned our rescue. It
tells us of His love in overseeing our existence (Ps. 139), meeting
our needs (Matt. 6:31-34), comforting us (2 Cor. 1:3-4), and saving us
through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus (Rom. 1:16-17).

You are loved beyond imagination. God says so in His inspired and
inspiring message to you. No wonder the psalmist wrote, “I will not
forget Your word” (Ps. 119:16). It is one amazing letter!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to examine the Bible’s pages, understand its truths, and
apply its teachings to my life. May I be as excited about Your letter
to me as I am about a letter, email, or Facebook posting by a friend.

The love of God for us is revealed in His letter to us—the Bible.
