Faultfinders Anonymous

And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more.
Philippians 1:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 1:1-11

Like many people, when I read a newspaper or magazine I notice the
misteaks in grammar and spelling. (You saw that, didn’t you!) I’m not
trying to find errors; they leap off the page at me! My usual reaction
is to criticize the publication and the people who produce it. “Why
don’t they use ‘spell check’ or hire a proofreader?”

You may have a similar experience in your area of expertise. It seems
that often, the more we know about something, the more judgmental we
become over mistakes. It can infect our relationships with people as
well.

Yet Philippians 1:9 expresses a different approach. Paul wrote, “And
this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in
knowledge and all discernment.” God’s plan is that the more we know
and understand, the more we love. Rather than cultivating a critical
spirit and pretending we don’t notice or don’t care, our understanding
should nourish empathy. Criticism is replaced by compassion.

Instead of our being faultfinders, the Lord calls us to be “filled
with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the
glory and praise of God” (v. 11).

When the Lord fills our hearts, we can overlook mistakes, hold our
criticism, and love others, no matter how much we know about them!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, by Your grace, please replace my critical spirit with Your love
and compassion for others.

To err is human; to forgive, divine. Alexander Pope
