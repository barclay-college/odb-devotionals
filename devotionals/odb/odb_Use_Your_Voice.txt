Use Your Voice

There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes
them.
1 Corinthians 12:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Corinthians 12:1–14

I was invited to meet a world-renowned pianist. Since I grew up
immersed in music—playing the violin and piano, and primarily singing
solos for church and other events—I was thrilled at the opportunity.

When I arrived to meet the pianist, I realized he spoke little
English; and to my surprise he provided a cello for me to play—an
instrument I’d never touched. He insisted that I play and he would
accompany me. I screeched out a few notes, trying to mimic my violin
training. Finally admitting that I was lost, we parted ways.

I awoke, realizing the scenario had been a dream. But since the
musical background presented in my dream was true, in my mind lingered
the words, Why didn’t you tell him you could sing?

God equips us to develop our natural talents and our spiritual gifts
for others (1 Corinthians 12:7). Through prayerful reading of the
Bible and the wise advice of others, we can better understand the
spiritual gift (or gifts) that is uniquely ours. The apostle Paul
reminds us that whatever our spiritual gift, we’re to take time to
find it and use it, knowing that the Spirit distributes the gifts
“just as he determines” (v. 11).

Let’s use the “voices” the Holy Spirit has given us to honor God and
serve other believers in Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

What’s your spiritual “voice,” and how can you use it today? Why is it
wrong to want others’ spiritual gifts?

Father, show me how You’ve gifted me and how I’m to use those gifts
for others.
