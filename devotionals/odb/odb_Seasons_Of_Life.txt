Seasons Of Life

To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under
heaven. —
Ecclesiastes 3:1

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:6-7,25-35

When I was a pastor, I served many women who were moms. I called on
them in the hospital and rejoiced with them for their precious babies
who had come into the world. I counseled with anxious mothers and
tried to assure them that God was watching over their rebellious
teenagers. I stood with mothers at the bedside of injured or ill
children and felt their pain. And I cried with them in their grief
when their son or daughter died.

Mary, the mother of Jesus, also experienced times of joy and sorrow.
What joy she must have felt when the Christ-child was born! (Luke
2:7). What excitement when the shepherds and later the wise men came
to worship Him (vv.8-20; Matt. 2:1-12). What uneasiness when Simeon
prophesied that a sword would pierce her soul (Luke 2:35). And what
heart-wrenching grief as Mary watched her Son dying on the cross!
(John 19:25-30). But her seasons of being a mother didn’t end with
that terrible scene. She rejoiced that He rose from the grave.

Mothers, and all of us for that matter, experience many great joys and
intense sorrows. But when we submit our lives to the Lord, every
season of life can serve His eternal purposes.
