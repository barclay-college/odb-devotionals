The Beautiful Bride

The marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself
ready. —
Revelation 19:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 19:4-9

I have officiated at a lot of weddings. Often planned according to the
dreams of the bride, each of the weddings has been unique. But one
thing is the same: adorned in their wedding dresses with hair
beautifully done and faces aglow, brides steal the show.

I find it intriguing that God describes us as His bride. Speaking of
the church, He says, “The marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride
has made herself ready” (Rev. 19:7 esv).

This is a great thought for those of us who have become discouraged
about the condition of the church. I grew up as a pastor’s kid,
pastored three churches, and have preached in churches all over the
world. I’ve counseled both pastors and parishioners about deep and
troubling problems in the church. And though the church often seems
unlovable, my love for the church has not changed.

But my reason for loving the church has changed. I now love it most of
all for whose it is. The church belongs to Christ; it is the bride of
Christ. Since the church is precious to Him, it is precious to me as
well. His love for His bride, as flawed as we may be, is nothing less
than extraordinary!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we look forward to the day when we will be robed in the fine
linens of purity and join You at the marriage supper of the Lamb.
Until then, remind us to love Your bride and to live beautifully for
You.

Since Christ loves His bride, the church, so should we.
