What’s Your Song?

So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the
Israelites.
Deuteronomy 31:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 31:15–22

Most Americans knew little about Alexander Hamilton—until 2015, when
Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote his hit musical Hamilton. Now schoolchildren
know Hamilton’s story by heart. They sing it to each other on the bus
and at recess. He’s their favorite founding father.

God knows the power of music, and He told Moses to “write down this
song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it”
(Deuteronomy 31:19). God knew that long after Moses was gone, when He
had brought Israel into the Promised Land, they would rebel and
worship other gods. So He told Moses, “This song will testify against
them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants” (v. 21).

Songs are nearly impossible to forget, so it’s wise to be selective
about what we sing. Some songs are just for fun, and that’s fine, but
we benefit from songs that boast in Jesus and encourage our faith. One
of the ways we “[make] the most of every opportunity” is when we speak
“to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit.” So
“sing and make music from your heart to the Lord” (see Ephesians
5:15–19).

Songs can be an indicator of the direction of our heart. Do the words
make much of Jesus? Do we sing them wholeheartedly? What we sing will
influence what we believe, so choose wisely and sing loudly.

Reflect & Pray

What should you look for in a worship song? Is there a favorite song
you can sing more often? Why?

Father, this song is my prayer to You. (Sing your favorite.)
