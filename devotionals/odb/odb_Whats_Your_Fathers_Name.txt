What’s Your Father’s Name?

To those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become
children of God.
John 1:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 8:39–47

When I went to buy a cell phone in the Middle East, I was asked the
typical questions: name, nationality, address. But then as the clerk
was filling out the form, he asked, “What’s your father’s name?” That
question surprised me, and I wondered why it was important. Knowing my
father’s name would not be important in my culture, but here it was
necessary in order to establish my identity. In some cultures,
ancestry is important.

The Israelites believed in the importance of ancestry too. They were
proud of their patriarch Abraham, and they thought being part of
Abraham’s clan made them God’s children. Their human ancestry was
connected, in their opinion, to their spiritual family.

Hundreds of years later when Jesus was talking with the Jews, He
pointed out that this was not so. They could say Abraham was their
earthly ancestor, but if they didn’t love Him—the One sent by the
Father—they were not part of God’s family.

The same applies today. We don’t choose our human family, but we can
decide the spiritual family we belong to. If we believe in Jesus’s
name, God gives us the right to become His children (John 1:12).

Who is your spiritual Father? Have you decided to follow Jesus?
Let this be the day you trust in Jesus for the forgiveness of your
sins and become part of God’s family.
