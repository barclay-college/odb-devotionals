No Substitute Needed

Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your
presence? —
Psalm 139:7

Today's Scripture: Psalm 139:1-12

While I was visiting my son in San Diego, we decided to go to Shadow
Mountain Church to hear Dr. David Jeremiah preach. Steve and I got up
early on Sunday morning and took the hour-long drive to the church.
But our anticipation turned to disappointment when we discovered that
Dr. Jeremiah was not there that day. “Some other guy”—a substitute—was
preaching.

A couple of weeks later, I was scheduled to preach at the church in
Grand Rapids where my wife and I attend. As I stood in front of the
congregation, I realized that now I was “some other guy” and they
might be disappointed because they had come to hear our pastor—not
me—speak.

While we find comfort in the familiarity of those we depend on in
life, we have to recognize that at times they can be substituted. But
the One we need most—the One on whom we depend for life itself—is
always present (Ps. 139:7-8). When we desire to enter God’s presence
in prayer, He is always there: “Evening and morning and at noon I will
pray, and cry aloud, and He shall hear my voice” (55:17).

Looking for God? He’s always right there. No substitute needed.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, I am so thankful that You are always present. I never need
to make an appointment to speak to You, the God of the universe. No
matter where I go or what time it is, I can depend on Your presence.

When you come to the Lord, there is no waiting line—His ears are
always open to your cry.
