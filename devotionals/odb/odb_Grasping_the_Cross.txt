Grasping the Cross

Not that I have . . . already arrived at my goal, but I press on to
take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
Philippians 3:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:7–12

In 1856, Charles Spurgeon, the great London preacher, founded the
Pastors’ College to train men for the Christian ministry. It was
renamed Spurgeon’s College in 1923. Today’s college crest shows a hand
grasping a cross and the Latin words, Et Teneo, Et Teneor, which
means, “I hold and am held.” In his autobiography, Spurgeon wrote,
“This is our College motto. We . . . hold forth the Cross of Christ
with a bold hand . . . because that Cross holds us fast by its
attractive power. Our desire is that every man may both hold the
Truth, and be held by it; especially the truth of Christ crucified.”

In Paul’s letter to the Philippians, he expressed this truth as the
bedrock of his life. “Not that I have . . . already arrived at my
goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took
hold of me” (Phil. 3:12). As followers of Jesus, we extend the message
of the cross to others as Jesus holds us fast in His grace and power.
“I have been crucified with Christ; and I no longer live, but Christ
lives in me” (Gal. 2:20).

Our Lord holds us in His grip of love each day—and we hold out His
message of love to others.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, Your cross is the focal point of history and the turning
point of our lives. Hold us tightly as we cling to Your cross and
extend your love to others.

We hold to the cross of Christ and are held by it.
