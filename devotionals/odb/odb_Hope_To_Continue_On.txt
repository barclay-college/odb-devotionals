Hope To Continue On

Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His
compassions fail not. They are new every morning. —
Lamentations 3:22-23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Lamentations 3:19-33

The solar-powered airplane Solar Impulse can fly day and night without
fuel. Inventors Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg hope to fly it
around the world in 2015. While the plane flies all day by solar
power, it gathers enough energy to be able to fly all night. When the
sun rises, Piccard says, “It brings the hope again that you can
continue.”

The idea of sunrise bringing us hope makes me think of Lamentations 3
from our Bible reading for today: “This I recall to my mind, therefore
I have hope. Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because
His compassions fail not. They are new every morning” (vv.21-23). Even
when God’s people were in the depths of despair while the city of
Jerusalem was being invaded by the Babylonians, the prophet Jeremiah
said they had reason to hope—they still had the Lord’s mercies and
compassions.

Sometimes our struggles seem worse at night, but when sunrise comes it
brings hope again that we can continue. “Weeping may endure for a
night,” the psalmist says, “but joy comes in the morning” (Ps. 30:5).

Thank You, Lord, for the hope You send with each sunrise. Your mercies
and compassions are new every morning!

New mercies every morning, Grace for every day, New hope for every

Each new day gives us new reasons to praise the Lord.
