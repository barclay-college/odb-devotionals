Pink Sheep

By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for
one another. —
John 13:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 10:7-18

While traveling on a road from Glasgow to Edinburgh, Scotland, I was
enjoying the beautiful, pastoral countryside when a rather humorous
sight captured my attention. There, on a small hilltop, was a rather
large flock of pink sheep.

I know that sheep owners mark their animals with dots of spray paint
to identify them—but these sheep really stood out. The owner had fully
covered every animal with pink coloring. Everyone knew who those sheep
belonged to.

Scripture calls followers of Christ sheep, and they too have a unique
identifying mark. What is the “pink coloring” in a Christ-follower’s
life? How can someone be identified as Jesus’ own?

In the gospel of John, Jesus, the Good Shepherd, told us what that
identifier is: love. “Love one another; as I have loved you . . . . By
this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one
another” (John 13:34-35).

In words and deeds, a believer should show love to all those around.
“Beloved,” John writes, “if God so loved us, we also ought to love one
another” (1 John 4:11). A Christian’s love for others should be as
obvious as pink wool on a flock of Scottish sheep.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, remind me that this life is not about me and my needs, but
about others and how Your love can shine through me to them. May
Christlike love be my distinguishing characteristic.

As followers of Christ, our love should make us stand out in a crowd.
