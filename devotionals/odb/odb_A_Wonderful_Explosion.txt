A Wonderful Explosion

As I have loved you, . . . you also love one another. —
John 13:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 13:31-35

In the book Kisses from Katie, Katie Davis recounts the joy of moving
to Uganda and adopting several Ugandan girls. One day, one of her
daughters asked, “Mommy, if I let Jesus come into my heart, will I
explode?” At first, Katie said no. When Jesus enters our heart, it is
a spiritual event.

However, after she thought more about the question, Katie explained
that when we decide to give our lives and hearts to Jesus “we will
explode with love, with compassion, with hurt for those who are
hurting, and with joy for those who rejoice.” In essence, knowing
Christ results in a deep care for the people in our world.

The Bible challenges us to “rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep
with those who weep” (Rom. 12:15). We can consistently display this
loving response because of the Holy Spirit’s work in our hearts. When
we receive Christ, the Holy Spirit comes to live inside us. The
apostle Paul described it this way, “Having believed [in Christ,] you
were sealed with the Holy Spirit” (Eph. 1:13).

Caring for others—with God’s supernatural assistance—shows the world
that we are His followers (John 13:35). It also reminds us of His love
for us. Jesus said, “As I have loved you, . . . you also love one
another” (v.34).
