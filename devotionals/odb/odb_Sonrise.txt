Sonrise!

The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings. —
Malachi 4:2

Today's Scripture: Malachi 4:1-6

My state’s name, “Idaho,” according to one legend, comes from a
Shoshone Indian word, “ee-dah-how.” When translated into English, it
means something like, “Behold! The sun rising over the mountain.” I
often think of that when the sun breaks over the eastern peaks and
spills light and life into our valley.

Also, I think of Malachi’s promise: “The Sun of Righteousness shall
arise with healing in His wings” (Mal. 4:2). This is God’s irrevocable
promise that our Lord Jesus will come again and all creation “will be
delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of
the children of God” (Rom. 8:21).

Each new sunrise is a reminder of that eternal morning when “bright
heaven’s Sun” will arise with healing in His wings. Then everything
that has been made will be made over and made irrevocably right. There
will be no throbbing backs or knees, no financial struggles, no
losses, no aging. One Bible version says that when Jesus returns we
will “go out and leap like calves released from the stall” (Mal. 4:2
NIV). This is my highest imagination and my hope.

Jesus said, “Surely I am coming quickly” (Rev. 22:20). Even so, come,
Lord Jesus!
