Live Like Jesus Is Coming

Keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.
Matthew 25:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 25:1–13

I’m inspired by country singer Tim McGraw’s song “Live Like You Were
Dying.” In it he describes some of the exciting “bucket list” things a
man did after receiving some bad news about his health. He also chose
to love and forgive people more freely—speaking to them more tenderly.
The song recommends that we live well, as if knowing our lives will
end soon.

This song reminds us that our time is limited. It’s important for us
to not put off for tomorrow what we can do today, because one day
we’ll run out of tomorrows. This is particularly urgent for believers
in Jesus, who believe that Jesus may return at any moment (perhaps in
the very second you’re reading this sentence!). Jesus urges us to be
ready, not living like the five “foolish” virgins who were caught
unprepared when the bridegroom returned (Matthew 25:6–10).

But McGraw’s song doesn’t tell the whole story. We who love Jesus will
never run out of tomorrows. Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the
life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and
whoever lives by believing in me will never die” (John 11:25–26). Our
life in Him never ends.

So don’t live like you’re dying. Because you’re not. Rather, live like
Jesus is coming. Because He is!

Reflect & Pray

How will you live today like Jesus is coming soon? How does knowing He
could return any day affect your choices?

Jesus, I look forward to the day You’ll return. May I use the time
I’ve been given to honor You and to serve others well.
