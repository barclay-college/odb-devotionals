Peace

You, who once were alienated . . . now He has reconciled. —
Colossians 1:21

Today's Scripture: Colossians 1:19-29

In the days of Adam and Eve, peace was lost. As soon as they ate the
forbidden fruit and realized their nakedness, they started blaming
each other (Gen. 3:12-13) and introduced conflict to God’s peaceful
planet. Sadly, all of their descendants, including us, have followed
their bad example. We blame others for our own bad choices and become
angry when no one will accept the guilt. Blaming others for our
unhappiness breaks apart families, churches, communities, and nations.
We can’t make peace because we’re preoccupied with placing the blame.

Christmas is the season of peace. The Old Testament tells the story of
how God set the stage to introduce the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6).
Jesus came to break the cycle of sin and blame by making peace for us
with God “through the blood of His cross” (Col. 1:20). Instead of
blaming us for all the trouble we cause, He bore the blame for all of
us. He is now recruiting followers who, having received His
forgiveness, want others to receive it as well.

When we accept forgiveness from God, we lose our desire to withhold it
from others. And when we live in peace with God, we are eager to make
peace with others. We can both give and receive the gift of peace this
Christmas.

Reflect & Pray

At Christmastime we celebrate The coming of the Prince of Peace;
Though now our world is locked in strife, One day He’ll make all
conflict cease. —Sper

Jesus took our place to give us His peace.
