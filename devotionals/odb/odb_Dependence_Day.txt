Dependence Day

I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in
him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. —
John 15:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 15:1-13

In the US, the Fourth of July is a national holiday when outdoor
grills are heated up; beaches are packed; and cities and towns have
parades and fireworks displays, picnics, and patriotic celebrations.
All of this is in remembrance of July 4, 1776, when the 13 American
colonies declared their independence.

Independence appeals to all ages. It means “freedom from the control,
influence, support, and aid of others.” So it’s not surprising that
teenagers talk about gaining their independence. Many adults have the
goal of being “independently wealthy.” And senior citizens want to
maintain their independence. Whether anyone is ever truly independent
is a discussion for another time and place—but it sounds good.

Craving political or personal independence is one thing; daring to
pursue spiritual independence is problematic. What we need instead is
a recognition and acceptance of our deep spiritual dependence. Jesus
said, “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I
in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing” (John
15:5).

Far from being self-reliant, we are totally and eternally dependent on
the One who died to set us free. Every day is our “dependence day.”

Reflect & Pray

I need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord; No tender voice like Thine
can peace afford. I need Thee, O I need Thee; every hour I need Thee!
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee. —Hawks/Lowry

Our greatest strength comes from dependence on our strong God.
