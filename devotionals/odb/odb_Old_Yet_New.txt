Old Yet New

He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new.”
Revelation 21:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 21:1–5

In 2014, a sinkhole opened up under the National Corvette Museum in
Kentucky, swallowing eight vintage, irreplaceable Chevrolet Corvette
sports cars. The automobiles were severely damaged—some beyond repair.

One car in particular received a lot of attention. The one-millionth
Corvette, which rolled off the assembly line in 1992, was the most
valuable in the collection. What happened to that gem after it was
pulled from the sinkhole is fascinating. Experts restored the car to
mint condition, mainly by using and repairing its original parts.
Although this little beauty was in horrible shape, it now looks as
good as it did the day it was built.

The old and damaged was made new.

This is a great reminder of what God has in store for believers in
Jesus. In Revelation 21:1, John spoke of seeing “a new heaven and a
new earth.” Many biblical scholars see this “new” earth as a renovated
earth, for their study of the word new here reveals that it means
“fresh” or “restored” after the decay of the old has been wiped away.
God will renovate what is corrupt on this earth and provide a fresh,
yet familiar place where believers will live with Him.

What an amazing truth to contemplate: a new, refreshed, familiar, and
beautiful earth. Imagine the majesty of God’s handiwork!
