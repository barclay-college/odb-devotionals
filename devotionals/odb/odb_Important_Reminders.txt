Important Reminders

These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts.
Deuteronomy 6:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 6:1–12

Anthropologist Anthony Graesch says that the outside of a refrigerator
reveals what’s important to people. During a research study of
families in Los Angeles, Graesch and his colleagues noted an average
of 52 items posted on the fridge—including school schedules, family
photos, children’s drawings, and magnets. Graesch calls the
refrigerator “a repository of family memory.”

The Lord may use a tangible item like a photo, keepsake, or Scripture
verse to remind us of His faithfulness and the call to obey His Word.
When Moses addressed the Israelites just before they entered the land
of Canaan, he urged them to keep all the commands God had given them.
“Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home
and when you walk along the road . . . . Write them on the doorframes
of your houses and on your gates”  (Deut. 6:7, 9).

Giving God’s Word a visible place of honor in their homes and lives
was a powerful daily reminder to “be careful that you do not forget
the Lord, who brought you . . . out of the land of slavery” (v. 12).

Today the Lord encourages us to remember that as we obey His Word, we
can depend on His faithful care for all that lies ahead.
