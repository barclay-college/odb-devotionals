Doing Right in God’s Sight

Joash did what was right . . . all the years Jehoiada the priest
instructed him.
2 Kings 12:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 12:1-15

“Cowboy builders” is a term many British homeowners use for
tradespeople who do shoddy construction work. The term is bandied
about with fear or regret, often because of bad experiences.

No doubt there were rogue carpenters, masons, and stonecutters in
biblical times, but tucked away in the story of King Joash repairing
the temple is a line about the complete honesty of those who oversaw
and did the work (2 Kings 12:15).

However, King Joash “did what was right in the eyes of the Lord” (v.
2) only when Jehoiada the priest instructed him. As we see in 2
Chronicles 24:17-27, after Jehoiada died Joash turned from the Lord
and was persuaded to worship other gods.

The mixed legacy of a king who enjoyed a season of fruitfulness only
while under the spiritual counsel of a godly priest makes me stop and
think. What will our legacies be? Will we continue to grow and develop
in our faith throughout our lives, producing good fruit? Or will we
become distracted by the things of this world and turn to modern-day
idols—such as comfort, materialism, and self-promotion?
