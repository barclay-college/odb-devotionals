A Child’s Potential

Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will
not depart from it. —
Proverbs 22:6

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 22:1-6

Louis Armstrong was well known for his smiling face, raspy voice,
white handkerchief, and virtuoso trumpet playing. Yet his childhood
was one of want and pain. He was abandoned by his father as an infant
and sent to reform school when he was only 12. Surprisingly, this
became a positive turning point.

Music professor Peter Davis regularly visited the school and provided
musical training for the boys. Soon Louis excelled on the cornet and
became the leader of the boys’ band. His life trajectory seemed to
have been reset to become a world-famous trumpet player and
entertainer.

Louis’ story can be an example for Christian parents. The proverb:
“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will
not depart from it” (Prov. 22:6) can apply to more than the spiritual
and moral aspects of our children’s lives. We should also realize that
a child’s giftedness will often determine his or her area of interest.
In the case of Louis, a little training in music resulted in a
virtuoso trumpet player.

As we lovingly provide to our children godly instruction from God’s
Word, we should encourage them in their interests and giftedness so
that they might become all that God has planned for them to be.
