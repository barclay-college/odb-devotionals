Forced Leisure

The Lord your God in your midst, the Mighty One, will save; He will
rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He
will rejoice over you with singing. —
Zephaniah 3:17

Today's Scripture: Zephaniah 3:14-20

Just before Christmas one year, a friend was diagnosed with leukemia
and was told she must begin chemotherapy immediately. Just a few weeks
earlier, Kim had told friends how blessed and content she felt with a
loving family, a comfortable home, and a new grandson. As she entered
the hospital, Kim asked Jesus to make His presence known to her and to
stay close.

The next 7 months of treatments followed by recovery in partial
isolation became a season she calls “forced leisure.” She says she
learned how to slow down, reflect quietly, and rest in God’s goodness,
love, and perfect plan—regardless of whether or not she would be
healed.

One of God’s promises to His people Israel became personal to Kim:
“The Lord your God . . . will save; He will rejoice over you with
gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you
with singing” (Zeph. 3:17).

Kim is in remission after a journey she says changed her life for the
better. Now back in her busy routine, she often pauses to recapture
the lessons of “forced leisure.”

How important that we—in good times or times of challenge—draw near to
God’s loving heart to hear His voice and place our lives in His hands.

Reflect & Pray

A troubled heart, a wearied mind Are burdens hard to bear; A lack of
peace, a heavy load Are lifted by God’s care. —Fitzhugh

People are at the heart of God’s heart.
