The Gift of the Magi

We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.
Matthew 2:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 2:1–12

A young married couple had more love than money. As Christmas neared,
both struggled to find a gift that would show how much they cared for
the other. Finally, on Christmas Eve, Della sold her long, knee-length
hair to buy Jim a platinum chain for the watch he’d inherited from his
father and grandfather. Jim, however, had just sold the watch to buy a
set of expensive combs for Della’s hair.

Author O. Henry called the couple’s story The Gift of the Magi. His
creation suggests that even though their gifts became useless and may
have caused them to look foolish on Christmas morning, their love made
them among the wisest of those who give gifts.

The wise men of the first Christmas story also could have looked
foolish to some as they arrived in Bethlehem with gifts of gold,
frankincense, and myrrh (Matthew 2:11). They weren’t Jewish. They were
outsiders, Gentiles, who didn’t realize how much they would disturb
the peace of Jerusalem by asking about a newly born king of the Jews
(v. 2).

As with Jim and Della’s experience, the magi’s plans didn’t turn out
the way they expected. But they gave what money cannot buy. They came
with gifts, but then bowed to worship One who would ultimately make
the greatest of all loving sacrifices for them—and for us.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, please help us to learn what it means to give what
money cannot buy.

God’s gift of grace is priceless.
