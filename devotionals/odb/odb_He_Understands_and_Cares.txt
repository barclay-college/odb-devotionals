He Understands and Cares

Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering.
Isaiah 53:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 53:1–8

When asked if he thought that ignorance and apathy were problems in
modern society, a man joked, “I don’t know and I don’t care.”

I suppose many discouraged people feel that way about the world today
and the people in it. But when it comes to the perplexities and
concerns of our lives, Jesus fully understands, and He deeply cares.
Isaiah 53, an Old Testament prophecy of the crucifixion of Jesus,
gives us a glimpse of what He went through for us. “He was oppressed
and afflicted . . . led like a lamb to the slaughter” (v. 7). “For the
transgression of my people he was punished” (v. 8). “It was the Lord’s
will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the Lord makes
his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong
his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand” (v. 10).

On the cross Jesus willingly bore our sin and guilt. No one ever
suffered more than our Lord did for us. He knew what it would cost to
save us from our sins and, in love, He willingly paid it (vv. 4–6).

Because of Jesus’s resurrection from the dead, He is alive and present
with us today. Whatever situation we face, Jesus understands and
cares. And He will carry us through.
