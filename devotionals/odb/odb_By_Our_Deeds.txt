By Our Deeds

Even a child is known by his deeds, whether what he does is pure and
right. —
Proverbs 20:11

Today's Scripture: Matthew 23:23-31

One night a clergyman was walking to church when a thief pulled a gun
on him and demanded his money or his life. When he reached in his
pocket to hand over his wallet, the robber saw his clerical collar and
said: “I see you are a priest. Never mind, you can go.” The clergyman,
surprised by the robber’s unexpected act of piety, offered him a candy
bar. The robber said, “No thank you. I don’t eat candy during Lent.”

The man had given up candy as a supposed sacrifice for Lent, but his
lifestyle of stealing showed his real character! According to the
writer of Proverbs, conduct is the best indicator of character. If
someone says he is a godly person, his words can only be proven by
consistent actions (20:11). This was true of the religious leaders in
Jesus’ day as well. He condemned the Pharisees and exposed their sham
for professing godliness but denying that profession with sin in their
lives (Matt. 23:13-36). Appearances and words are deceiving; behavior
is the best judge of character. This applies to all of us.

As followers of Jesus, we demonstrate our love for Him by what we do,
not just by what we say. May our devotion to God, because of His love
for us, be revealed in our actions today.

Reflect & Pray

Spiritual words are mere distractions If not backed up by our godly
actions, And all our good and beautiful creeds Are nothing without
God-honoring deeds. —Williams

Conduct is the best proof of character.
