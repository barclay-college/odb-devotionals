Clocks and Calendars

Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him,
for God is our refuge.
Psalm 62:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 62

My father died at 58 years of age. Ever since then, I pause on the
date he died to remember Dad and reflect on his influence in my life.
When I realized I had lived more of life without my dad than with him,
I began pondering the brevity of my own life.

On reflection, we may wrestle with both an event in time and the
feelings it stirs within us. Though we measure time with clocks and
calendars, we remember times because of events. In the moments of life
that trigger our deepest emotions, we can experience joy, loss,
blessing, pain, success, failure.

The Scriptures encourage us: “Trust in him at all times, you people;
pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge” (Psalm 62:8). This
confident statement did not occur in a time of ease. David wrote these
words while surrounded by enemies (vv. 3–4). Still, he waited quietly
before God (vv. 1, 5) reminding us that God’s unfailing love (v. 12)
is greater than any of the times of struggle we may face.

In every event, we have this confidence: Our God stands with us, and
He is more than adequate to carry us through all of life’s moments.
When the times of life threaten to overwhelm us, His help will be
right on time.
