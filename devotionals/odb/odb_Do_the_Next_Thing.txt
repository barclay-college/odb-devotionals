Do the Next Thing

If you love me, keep my commands.
John 14:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 14:15–21

When was the last time you felt compelled to help someone, only to let
the moment pass without a response? In The 10-Second Rule, Clare De
Graaf suggests that daily impressions can be one of the ways God calls
us to a deeper spiritual walk, a life of obedience prompted by love
for Him. The 10-Second Rule encourages you to simply “do the next
thing you’re reasonably certain Jesus wants you to do,” and to do it
right away “before you change your mind.”

Jesus says, “If you love me, keep my commands” (John 14:15). We might
think, I do love Him, but how can I be certain of His will and follow
it? In His wisdom, Jesus has provided what we need to better
understand and follow the wisdom found in the Bible. He once said, “I
will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you
and will be with you forever—the Spirit of truth” (vv. 16–17). It’s by
the work of the Spirit, who is with us and in us, that we can learn to
obey Jesus and “keep [His] commands” (v. 15)—responding to the
promptings experienced throughout our day (v. 17).

In the big and little things, the Spirit motivates us to confidently
do by faith what will honor God and reveal our love for Him and others
(v. 21).

Reflect & Pray

Why is it important for you to follow through on promptings that line
up with Scripture? How can you seek to live a more obedient life by
the power of the Holy Spirit?

The Holy Spirit provides what we need to follow Jesus in obedience.
