Will I Have To Tell?

If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. —
2 Corinthians 5:17

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 5:12-21

Jim was sharing the gospel with Kerri. He told her she was separated
from a holy God because of her sin, and that Jesus had died and risen
for her salvation. She kept coming up with one reason not to believe:
“But if I do receive Him, I won’t have to tell other people about it,
will I? I don’t want to do that.” She said that didn’t fit her
personality; she didn’t want to have to tell others about Jesus.

Jim explained that promising to witness about Jesus wasn’t a
requirement before receiving Him. But he also said that once she came
to know the Lord, Kerri would become His ambassador to the world (2
Cor. 5:20).

After talking a little longer, Kerri acknowledged her need for
salvation through Christ. She went home excited and at peace. Funny
thing happened—within 24 hours she told three people about what God
had done in her life.

Because we have been reconciled to God through Jesus, we now have “the
ministry of reconciliation,” according to the apostle Paul (v.18). We
are His ambassadors, and therefore we implore people “on Christ’s
behalf, be reconciled to God” (v.20).

When we’re thankful, we want to share what God has done.
