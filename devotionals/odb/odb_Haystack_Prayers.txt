Haystack Prayers

You help us by your prayers.
2 Corinthians 1:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 1:8–11

Samuel Mills and four of his friends often gathered together to pray
for God to send more people to share the good news of Jesus. One day
in 1806, after returning from their prayer meeting, they got caught in
a thunderstorm and took refuge in a haystack. Their weekly prayer
gathering then became known as the Haystack Prayer Meeting, which
resulted in a global mission movement. Today the Haystack Prayer
Monument stands at Williams College in the US as a reminder of what
God can do through prayer.

Our heavenly Father is delighted when His children approach Him with a
common request. It’s like a family gathering where they’re united in
purpose, sharing a common burden.

The apostle Paul acknowledges how God helped him through the prayers
of others during a time of severe suffering: “He will continue to
deliver us, as you help us by your prayers” (2 Corinthians 1:10–11).
God has chosen to use our prayers—especially our prayers together—to
accomplish His work in the world. No wonder the verse continues: “Then
many will give thanks . . . [for the] answer to the prayers of many.”

Let’s pray together so we can also rejoice together in God’s goodness.
Our loving Father is waiting for us to come to Him so He can work
through us in ways that reach far beyond anything we could ever
imagine.

Reflect & Pray

What request can you and others pray for? How has your faith been
strengthened when you pray with others?

Father, help us to pray together even as we work together.
