This Gift

Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so
that Christ’s power may rest on me.
2 Corinthians 12:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 12:6–10

A number of years ago I wrote an essay about my collection of canes,
staffs, and walking sticks and mused that I might someday graduate to
a walker. Well, the day has come. A combination of back issues and
peripheral neuropathy has left me pushing a three-wheel walker. I
can’t hike; I can’t fish; I can’t do many of the things that used to
bring me great joy.

I’m trying to learn, however, that my limitation, whatever it may be,
is a gift from God, and it is with this gift that I am to serve Him.
This gift and not another. This is true of all of us, whether our
limits are emotional, physical, or intellectual. Paul was so bold as
to say that he boasted in his weakness for it was in weakness that
God’s power was revealed in him (2 Cor. 12:9).

Seeing our so-called liabilities this way enables us to go about our
business with confidence and courage. Rather than complain, feel sorry
for ourselves, or opt out, we make ourselves available to God for His
intended purposes.

I have no idea what He has in mind for you and me, but we shouldn’t
worry about that. Our task today is just to accept things as they are
and to be content, knowing that in the love, wisdom, and providence of
God this moment is as good as it can possibly be.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, I know that You are good and You love me. I trust You to
give me everything I need for today.

Contentment enables you to grow where God has planted you.
