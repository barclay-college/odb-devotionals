Not At This Time

Be transformed by the renewing of your mind. —
Romans 12:2

Today's Scripture: Romans 11:33–12:2

It can be quite discouraging for wanna-be writers to get their work
rejected time after time. When they send in a manuscript to a
publisher, they’ll often hear back in a letter with these words:
“Thank you. But your submission does not meet our needs at this time.”
Sometimes this really means “not at this time—or ever.” So they try
the next publisher and the next.

I’ve found that the phrase This does not meet our needs at this
time—or ever can be a helpful saying in my Christian walk to renew my
mind and refocus my thoughts on the Lord.

Here’s what I mean. When starting to worry, we can remind ourselves:
“Worry does not meet my needs at this time—or ever. My heart’s need is
to trust God. I will ‘be anxious for nothing’ ” (Phil. 4:6).

When we envy what another person has or does, we can reinforce the
truth: “Envy does not meet my needs at this time—or ever. My need is
to give thanks to God. His Word says, ‘Envy is rottenness to the
bones’ (Prov. 14:30), and ‘In everything give thanks’ ” (1 Thess.
5:18).

We can’t renew our minds by ourselves (Rom. 12:2); it’s the
transforming work of the Holy Spirit who lives in us. Yet speaking the
truth in our thoughts can help us to submit to the Spirit’s work
within.

Reflect & Pray

For Further Thought What are some areas you struggle with in your
heart? Ask God to renew your mind that it might think like His. Then
keep reminding yourself of the truth.

The Spirit of God renews our minds when we review the Word of God.
