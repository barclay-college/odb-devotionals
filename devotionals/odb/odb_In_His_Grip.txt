In His Grip

I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has
also laid hold of me. —
Philippians 3:12

Today's Scripture: Romans 8:31-39

When we cross a busy street with small children in tow, we put out our
hand and say, “Hold on tight,” and our little ones grasp our hand as
tightly as they can. But we would never depend on their grasp. It is
our grip on their hand that holds them and keeps them secure. So Paul
insists, “Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me” (Phil. 3:12). Or more
exactly, “Christ has a grip on me!”

One thing is certain: It is not our grip on God that keeps us safe,
but the power of Jesus’ grasp. No one can take us out of His grasp—not
the devil, not even ourselves. Once we’re in His hands, He will not
let go.

We have this assurance: “I give them eternal life, and they shall
never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. My
Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is
able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand” (John 10:28-29).

Doubly safe: Our Father on one side and our Lord and Savior on the
other, clasping us in a viselike grip. These are the hands that shaped
the mountains and oceans and flung the stars into space. Nothing in
this life or the next “shall be able to separate us from the love of
God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 8:39).

Reflect & Pray

Father, I thank You for the nail-pierced hands that reached out in
love and took me by my hand. You have led me by Your right hand
throughout life. I trust You to hold me and keep me safe to the end.

The One who saved us is the One who keeps us.
