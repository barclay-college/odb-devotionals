The Upright Thumb

Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. —
Genesis 6:8

Today's Scripture: Genesis 6:11-22

According to an African fable, four fingers and a thumb lived together
on a hand. They were inseparable friends. One day, they noticed a gold
ring lying next to them and conspired to take it. The thumb said it
would be wrong to steal the ring, but the four fingers called him a
self-righteous coward and refused to be his friend. That was just fine
with the thumb; he wanted nothing to do with their mischief. This is
why, the legend goes, the thumb still stands separate from the other
fingers.

This tale reminds me that at times we may feel we’re standing alone
when wrongdoing surrounds us. In Noah’s day, the earth was filled with
violence; every thought in every heart was “evil continually” (Gen.
6:5,11). Yet “Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord” (v.8). Fully
devoted to God, Noah obeyed Him and built the ark. The Lord, in His
grace, spared him and his family.

We too have been shown God’s grace through His Son Jesus’ life, death,
and resurrection. We have every reason to bring Him honor and stand
strong for Him in our daily lives. He is always near, even abiding in
us, so we never really stand alone. His “ears are open to [our] cry”
(Ps. 34:15).

They show their colors when they stand For what is true and right; And
those who venture all on God Are pleasing in His sight. —D. DeHaan

It’s easy to stand with a crowd; it takes courage to stand alone.
