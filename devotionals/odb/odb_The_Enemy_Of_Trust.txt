The Enemy Of Trust

The Lord said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many.” —
Judges 7:2

Today's Scripture: Judges 7:2-8

Military commanders always want to have enough troops to accomplish
their mission. Most would prefer having too many not too few, but not
everyone agrees on just how many troops will be enough.

When Gideon recruited an army of 32,000 men to stand against those who
oppressed the Israelites, the Lord told him, “The people who are with
you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest
Israel claim glory for itself against Me, saying, ‘My own hand has
saved me’” (Judg. 7:2).

So the Lord began to reduce Gideon’s army. When the fearful were
allowed to leave, 22,000 men went home (v.3). A second reduction cut
the force from the remaining 10,000 to 300 troops, of whom the Lord
said, “By the three hundred . . . I will save you, and deliver the
Midianites into your hand” (v.7). And so it happened (vv.19-23).

In our life of faith, our resources can become the enemy of trust. God
wants us to depend on Him, not our own strength, whether physical,
financial, or intellectual.

When the Lord reduces our resources from “32,000 to 300,” it is not
punishment. It is preparation for Him to be glorified through our
lives as we acknowledge and trust His power.

Trust in God and you will know He can vanquish any foe; Simply trust
Him day by day— He will be your strength and stay. —D. De Haan

When God gives us an impossible task— it becomes possible.
