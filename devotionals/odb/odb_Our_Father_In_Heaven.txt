Our Father In Heaven

Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name. —
Luke 11:2

Today's Scripture: Luke 11:1-13

When Jesus taught us to pray, He began, “Our Father in heaven” (Luke
11:2). It is one of many Scriptures that refers to God as a father. I
find it both fascinating and instructive that when God wanted us to
know what He is like, He chose to emphasize His fatherhood.

What do we know about God as our Father? According to Jesus’ prayer,
we know that our Father in heaven is available and attentive to us. It
is also clear that He provides for us. He forgives us and protects us
from evil (vv.2-4).

What a wonderful pattern for fathers who aren’t in heaven! Granted,
there is only one perfect Father in the universe, but as such He sets
the pace for the rest of us less-than-perfect fathers. I discovered
early in my ministry that my children were not impressed with books I
wrote, titles I had, or places I spoke. They craved my time and
attention, the provision for basic needs, a love that patiently
forgave, and the creation of a safe place for them to grow and mature.
It’s a short but very profound list of fatherly duties.

And what about those who didn’t get a dad who met those needs? Take
heart in the fact that if you have been redeemed through Jesus you
have a perfect heavenly Father—and He’s the best Father of all.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, God, for being our Father, Shepherd, Guardian, and Guide.
We will never outgrow our need for Your love and care. We want to seek
You with all our heart that we might know You intimately.

The heavenly Father’s arms never tire of holding His children.
