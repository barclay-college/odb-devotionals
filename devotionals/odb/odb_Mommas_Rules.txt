Momma’s Rules

Put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows
corrupt. —
Ephesians 4:22

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 4:17-32

I met a delightful woman named “Momma Charlie,” who has raised a dozen
or so foster kids. These youngsters were assigned to her by the
courts, and she gave them a home with stability, guidance, and love.
She told me that every time a new child arrived, the first order of
business was to explain “Momma’s Rules.” These included behavioral
standards, plus chores that would provide much-needed help in the busy
household while teaching accountability to kids with little previous
training.

Some of the children may have balked at “Momma’s Rules,” thinking they
were robbing them of fun or pleasure—yet nothing would be further from
the truth. Those standards allowed for an orderly household where both
Momma and the children could find life enjoyable and peaceful.

Similarly, some look at the standards God set forth in the Bible as
obstacles that prevent us from enjoying life. However, the boundaries
God places actually protect us from our worst inclinations and foster
healthy responses to Him.

In Ephesians 4, for example, Paul provides some guidance for how we
are to live. As we live by these and other loving instructions from
God, we find protection and the opportunity for true, lasting joy.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for the boundaries of life that protect us from sin
and from ourselves. Give us the wisdom and grace to respond gratefully
to Your Word in areas of danger and temptation.

God’s Word is the compass that keeps us on course.
