Quiet Rest

I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, O Lord, make
me dwell in safety. —
Psalm 4:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 6:30-32;

Some years ago my son Brian and I agreed to haul some equipment into
an isolated Idaho backcountry ranch for a friend. There are no roads
into the area, at least none that my truck could negotiate. So Ralph,
the young ranch manager, arranged to meet us at road’s end with a
small wagon hitched to a pair of mules.

On the way into the ranch, Ralph and I started chatting and I learned
that he lived on the property year-round. “What do you do in the
winter?” I asked, knowing that winters in the high country were long
and bitter and that the ranch had no electricity or telephone service,
only a satellite radio. “How do you endure it?”

“Actually,” he drawled, “I find it right peaceable.”

In the midst of our pressure-filled days, we sometimes crave peace and
quiet. There is too much noise in the air; there are too many people
around. We want to “come aside . . . and rest a while” (Mark 6:31).
Can we find a place to do this?

Yes, there is such a place. When we take a few moments to reflect on
God’s love and mercy and cast our burdens on Him, we will find in that
quiet God-filled space the peace that the world has taken away.

Reflect & Pray

There is a place of quiet rest, Near to the heart of God, A place
where all is joy and peace, Near to the heart of God. —McAfee

Spending quiet time with God will bring quiet rest.
