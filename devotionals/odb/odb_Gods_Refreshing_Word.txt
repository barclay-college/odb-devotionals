God’s Refreshing Word

My word . . . shall not return to Me void. —
Isaiah 55:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 55:8-11

When I was a boy, our family would occasionally travel across Nevada.
We loved the desert thunderstorms. Accompanied by lightning bolts and
claps of thunder, huge sheets of rain would blanket the hot sand as
far as the eye could see. The cooling water refreshed the earth—and
us.

Water produces marvelous changes in arid regions. For example, the
pincushion cactus is completely dormant during the dry season. But
after the first summer rains, cactuses burst into bloom, displaying
delicate petals of pink, gold, and white.

Likewise, in the Holy Land after a rainstorm, dry ground can seemingly
sprout vegetation overnight. Isaiah used rain’s renewal to illustrate
God’s refreshing Word: “As the rain comes down, and the snow from
heaven, and do not return there, but water the earth, and make it
bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to
the eater, so shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall
not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it
shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it” (Isa. 55:10-11).

Scripture carries spiritual vitality. That’s why it doesn’t return
void. Wherever it encounters an open heart, it brings refreshment,
nourishment, and new life.

Reflect & Pray

God’s Word is like refreshing rain That waters crops and seed; It
brings new life to open hearts, And meets us in our need. —Sper

The Bible is to a thirsty soul what water is to a barren land.
