Multiply It

There shall be no more curse. —
Revelation 22:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 22:1-5

Amy had battled cancer for 5 years. Then the doctor told her that the
treatments were failing and she had just a few weeks to live. Wanting
some understanding and assurance about eternity, Amy asked her pastor,
“What will heaven be like?”

He asked her what she liked most about her life on earth. She talked
about walks and rainbows and caring friends and the laughter of
children. “So, then, are you saying I will have all of that there?”
she asked longingly.

Amy’s pastor replied, “I believe that your life there will be far more
beautiful and amazing than anything you ever loved or experienced
here. Think about what’s best here for you and multiply it over and
over and over. That’s what I think heaven will be.”

The Bible doesn’t describe in detail what life in eternity will be
like, but it does tell us that being with Christ in heaven is “far
better” than our present circumstance (Phil. 1:23). “There shall be no
more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and
His servants shall serve Him” (Rev. 22:3).

Best of all, we will see the Lord Jesus face to face. Our deepest
yearnings will be fully satisfied in Him.

Reflect & Pray

We’re thankful, Lord, for Your presence now in our lives. But what an
amazing day it will be when we meet You face to face! Life with You in
heaven will be greater by far.

To be with Jesus forever is the sum of all happiness.
