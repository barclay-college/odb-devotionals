Christmas Sacrifice

When the set time had fully come, God sent his Son.
Galatians 4:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 4:1-7

O. Henry’s classic tale “The Gift of the Magi” tells of Jim and Della,
a young married couple who are struggling financially. As Christmas
approaches they want to give special gifts to each other, but their
lack of money drives them to drastic measures. Jim’s prized possession
is a gold watch, while Della’s is her long, beautiful hair. So Jim
sells his watch in order to buy combs for Della’s hair, while Della
sells her hair to buy a chain for Jim’s watch.

The story has deservedly become beloved, for it reminds us that
sacrifice is at the heart of true love, and sacrifice is love’s truest
measure. This idea is particularly appropriate for Christmas, because
sacrifice is the heartbeat of the story of the birth of Christ. Jesus
Christ was born to die, and He was born to die for us. That is why the
angel told Joseph, “You are to give him the name Jesus, because he
will save his people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21).

Long before Christ’s birth, it had been determined that He would come
to rescue us from our fallenness—which means that we can never fully
appreciate the manger unless we see it in the shadow of the cross.
Christmas is completely about Christ’s love, seen most clearly in His
sacrifice for us.
