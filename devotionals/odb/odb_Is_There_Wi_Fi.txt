Is There Wi-Fi?

A wise person is hungry for knowledge, while the fool feeds on trash.
Proverbs 15:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 15:9–21

As I was preparing to go on a mission trip with some young people, the
most frequently asked question was, “Is there Wi-Fi?” And I assured
them there would be. So just imagine the wails and groans one night
when the Wi-Fi was down!

Many of us become anxious when we’re separated from our smartphones.
And when we do have our iPhones or Androids in our hands, we can be
fixated on our screens.

Like many things, the internet and all that it allows us to access can
become either a distraction or a blessing. It depends on what we do
with it. In Proverbs we read, “A wise person is hungry for knowledge,
while the fool feeds on trash” (15:14 nlt ).

Applying the wisdom of God’s Word to life, we can ask ourselves: Do we
check our social networks compulsively throughout the day? What does
that say about the things we hunger for? And do the things we read or
view online encourage sensible living (vv. 16–21), or are we feeding
on trash—gossip, slander, materialism, or sexual impurity?

As we yield to the work of the Holy Spirit, we can fill our minds with
things that are “true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely,
and admirable” (Philippians 4:8 nlt ). By God’s wisdom we can make
good choices that honor Him.
