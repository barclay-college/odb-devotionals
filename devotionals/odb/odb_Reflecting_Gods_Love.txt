Reflecting God’s Love

When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the
covenant law in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant
because he had spoken with the Lord.
Exodus 34:29

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 34:29–35

I had the privilege of serving as my mom’s caregiver during her
treatments at a live-in cancer care center. Even on her hardest days,
she read Scripture and prayed for others before getting out of bed.

She spent time with Jesus daily, expressing her faith through her
dependence on God, her kind deeds, and her desire to encourage and
pray for others. Never realizing how much her smiling face glowed with
the Lord’s loving grace, she shared God’s love with the people around
her until the day He called her home to heaven.

After Moses spent forty days and forty nights communing with God (Ex.
34:28), he descended Mount Sinai. He had no idea his intimate
connection with the Lord actually changed his appearance (v. 29). But
the Israelites could tell Moses had spoken with the Lord (vv. 30–32).
He continued meeting with God and influencing the lives of those
around him (vv. 33–35).

We might not be able to see how our experiences with God change us
over time, and our transformation will definitely not be as physically
apparent as Moses’s beaming face. But as we spend time with God and
surrender our lives to Him more and more each day, we can reflect His
love. God can draw others closer to Him as the evidence of His
presence shows in and through us.
