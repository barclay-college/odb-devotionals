Chin Up

Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.
2 Kings 6:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Kings 6:8–17

Emil was a homeless man who spent a whole year looking down at the
pavement as he plodded around the city day after day. He was ashamed
to meet the eyes of others in case they recognized him, for his life
had not always been lived out on the streets. Even more than that, he
was intent on finding a coin that had been dropped or a half-smoked
cigarette. His downward focus became such a habit that the bones of
his spine began to become fixed in that position so that he had great
difficulty in straightening up at all.

The prophet Elisha’s servant was looking in the wrong direction and
was terrified at the huge army the king of Aram had sent to capture
his master (2 Kings 6:15). But Elisha knew he was seeing only the
danger and the size of the opposition. He needed to have his eyes
opened to see the divine protection that surrounded them, which was
far greater than anything Aram could bring against Elisha (v. 17).

When life is difficult and we feel we are under pressure, it’s so easy
to see nothing but our problems. But the author of the letter to the
Hebrews suggests a better way. He reminds us that Jesus went through
unimaginable suffering in our place and that if we fix our eyes on Him
(12:2), He will strengthen us.

Reflect & Pray

Sometimes, Lord, it seems as if I can only see the knots and tangles
in the tapestry of my life. Please help me to open my eyes and see the
beautiful picture You are weaving.

Christ at the center brings life into focus.
