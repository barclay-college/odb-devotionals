Growing to Know

I can do all this through him who gives me strength.
Philippians 4:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:10–13

“You’re going to be an exchange student!” I was seventeen and thrilled
to hear I was approved to study in Germany. But it was only three
months before my departure, and I had never taken a class in German.

The days that followed found me cramming—studying for hours and even
writing words on my hands to memorize them.

Months later I was in a classroom in Germany, discouraged because I
didn’t know more of the language. That day a teacher gave me wise
advice. “Learning a language is like climbing a sand dune. Sometimes
you feel like you’re not getting anywhere. But just keep going and you
will.”

Sometimes I reflect on that insight when I consider what it means to
grow as a follower of Jesus. The apostle Paul recalled, “I have
learned the secret of being content in any and every situation.” Even
for Paul, personal peace didn’t happen overnight. It was something he
grew into. Paul shares the secret of his progress: “I can do all this
through him who gives me strength” (Philippians 4:12–13).

Life has its challenges. But as we turn to the One who has “overcome
the world” (John 16:33), we discover not only that He’s faithful to
get us through but also that nothing matters more than closeness to
Him. He gives us His peace, helps us to trust, and empowers us to go
the distance as we walk with Him.
