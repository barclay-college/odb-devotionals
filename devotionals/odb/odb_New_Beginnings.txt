New Beginnings

Behold, I will do a new thing, now it shall spring forth; shall you
not know it? —
Isaiah 43:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 43:14-21

New beginnings are possible. Just ask Brayan, a young man who joined a
gang in elementary school. Brayan ran away when he was 12 years old,
and for 3 years was lost in gang and drug life. Although he left the
gang and returned home, it was difficult for him, as he had been
expelled from school for selling drugs. When he enrolled in a new high
school, however, a teacher inspired and encouraged him to write about
his experiences rather than repeat them. He embraced the challenge and
is now experiencing a fresh start.

God, through the prophet Isaiah, encouraged Jewish exiles to think
about a new beginning as well. God said, “Do not remember the former
things, nor consider the things of old” (Isa. 43:18). He told them to
stop dwelling on their punishment and even on His display of power
through the original exodus from Egypt. He wanted their attention to
be focused on God who would give them a new beginning by bringing them
home from Babylon through a new exodus (v.19).

With God, new beginnings are possible in our hearts. He can help us to
let go of the past and start clinging to Him. Relationship with Him
provides a new hope for all who will trust Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, we need Your touch on our lives. Work in our hearts in whatever
areas need a fresh start. Help us to do our part and to trust You to
do what only You can do.

God gives fresh starts from the inside out.
