God’s Doing Something New

May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and
for everyone else, just as ours does for you.
1 Thessalonians 3:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 3:6–13

“Is God doing something new in your life?” was the question the leader
asked in a group I was in recently. My friend Mindy, who is dealing
with some difficult situations, responded. She told of needing
patience with aging parents, stamina for her husband’s health issues,
and understanding of her children and grandchildren who have not yet
chosen to follow Jesus. Then she made an insightful comment that runs
contrary to what we might normally think: “I believe the new thing God
is doing is He’s expanding my capacity and opportunities to love.”

That fits nicely with the apostle Paul’s prayer for new believers in
Thessalonica: “May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for
each other and for everyone else” (1 Thess. 3:12). He had taught them
about Jesus but had to leave abruptly because of rioting (Acts
17:1–9). Now in his letter he encouraged them to continue to stand
firm in their faith (1 Thess. 3:7–8). And he prayed that the Lord
would increase their love for all.

During difficulties we often choose to complain and ask, Why? Or
wonder, Why me? Another way to handle those times could be to ask the
Lord to expand His love in our hearts and to help us take the new
opportunities that come to love others.

Reflect & Pray

I’ve got my own list of things I could worry about, Lord. Change my
thinking. Open my eyes to love.

Our troubles can fill our prayers with love and empathy for others.
