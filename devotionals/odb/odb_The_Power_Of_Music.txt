The Power Of Music

I will sing of Your power; yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the
morning; for You have been my defense and refuge in the day of my
trouble. —
Psalm 59:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 59:6-16

In Wales, the music of men’s chorus groups is deeply engrained in the
culture. Prior to World War II, one Welsh glee club had a friendly yet
competitive rivalry with a German glee club, but that bond was
replaced with animosity during and after the war. The tension was
gradually overcome, though, by the message on the trophy shared by the
two choruses: “Speak with me, and you’re my friend. Sing with me, and
you’re my brother.”

The power of music to heal and help is a gift from God that comforts
many. Perhaps that is why the Psalms speak so deeply to us. There we
find lyrics that connect with our hearts, allowing us to speak to God
from the depth of our spirits. “But I will sing of Your power; yes, I
will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning; for You have been my
defense and refuge in the day of my trouble” (Ps. 59:16). Amazingly,
David wrote this song as he was being hunted down by men seeking to
kill him! Despite his circumstances, David remembered God’s power and
mercy, and singing of them encouraged him to go on.

May our God give us a song today that will remind us of His goodness
and greatness, no matter what we may face.
