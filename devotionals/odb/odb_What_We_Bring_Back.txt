What We Bring Back

I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous
forsaken or their children begging bread.
Psalm 37:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 37:1–6, 23–27

John F. Burns spent forty years covering world events for The New York
Times. In an article written after his retirement in 2015, Burns
recalled the words of a close friend and fellow journalist who was
dying of cancer. “Never forget,” his colleague said, “It’s not how far
you’ve traveled; it’s what you’ve brought back.”

Psalm 37 could be considered David’s list of what he “brought back”
from his journey of life, from shepherd to soldier and king. The psalm
is a series of couplets contrasting the wicked with the righteous, and
affirming those who trust the Lord.

“Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who
do wrong; for like the grass they will soon wither” (vv. 1–2).

“The Lord makes firm the steps of the one who delights in him; though
he may stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his
hand” (vv. 23–24).

“I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous
forsaken or their children begging bread” (v. 25).

From our experiences in life, what has God taught us? How have we
experienced His faithfulness and love? In what ways has the Lord’s
love shaped our lives?

It’s not how far we’ve traveled in life, but what we’ve brought back
that counts.
