Words That Matter

That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have
seen with our eyes . . . this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.
1 John 1:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 1:1–4

Early in my days of working as an editor for Our Daily Bread, I
selected the cover verse for each month’s devotional. After a while, I
began to wonder if it made a difference.

Not long after that, a reader wrote and described how she had prayed
for her son for more than twenty years, yet he wanted nothing to do
with Jesus. Then one day he stopped by to visit her, and he read the
verse on the cover of the booklet that sat on her table. The Spirit
used those words to convict him, and he gave his life to Jesus at that
very moment.

I don’t recall the verse or the woman’s name. But I’ll never forget
the clarity of God’s message to me that day. He had chosen to answer a
woman’s prayers through a verse selected nearly a year earlier. From a
place beyond time, He brought the wonder of His presence to my work
and His words.

John the disciple called Jesus “the Word of life” (1 John 1:1). He
wanted everyone to know what that meant. “We proclaim to you the
eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us,” he
wrote of Jesus (v. 2). “We proclaim to you what we have seen and
heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us” (v. 3).

There is nothing magical in putting words on a page. But there is
life-changing power in the words of Scripture because they point us to
the Word of life—Jesus.

Thank You, Father, that Your Word is living and powerful!

Words that point us to Christ are always words that matter.
