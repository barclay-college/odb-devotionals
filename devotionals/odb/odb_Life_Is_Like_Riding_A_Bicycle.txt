Life Is Like Riding A Bicycle

All these . . . obtained a good testimony through faith. —
Hebrews 11:39

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 11:32-40

In a letter to his son Eduard, Albert Einstein gave this advice: “Life
is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.”
The great physicist’s advice is wise and practical.

This wise counsel can apply to the Christian life. Many believers by
faith keep moving ahead through painful and trying circumstances. But
when they experience a personal moral failure, they lose their balance
and fall. Their regret and feeling of unworthiness of God’s
forgiveness may then keep them down and they no longer move ahead in
their spiritual life.

The Bible gives us many examples of those who have experienced serious
personal failure. Abraham lied to Pharaoh about his wife, Sarah (Gen.
12:11-17). Jacob deceived his father to acquire Esau’s blessing (Gen.
27:18-29). Moses disobeyed God by striking the rock instead of
speaking to it (Num. 20:7-12). Despite their failures, we are told:
“all these . . . obtained a good testimony through faith” (Heb.
11:39).

These biblical characters are lifted up as examples because after they
fell, they turned back to God and began to follow Him again. Have you
lost your spiritual balance through a sinful choice, which is keeping
you down? Repent and follow the God of second chances once again.

Reflect & Pray

I’ve strayed, O Lord, and turned aside, I’ve disobeyed Your voice; But
now contrite of heart I turn And make Your will my choice. —D. De Haan

Our God is a God of second chances.
