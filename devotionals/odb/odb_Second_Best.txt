Second Best?

While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. —
Romans 5:8

Today's Scripture: Genesis 29:16-30

Leah must have laid awake all night thinking of the moment when her
new husband would awaken. She knew that it was not her face he
expected to see, but Rachel’s. Jacob had been a victim of deception,
and when he realized that a “bait and switch” had occurred, he quickly
made a new deal with Laban to claim the woman he had been promised
(Gen. 29:25-27).

Have you ever felt insignificant or second-best? Leah felt that way.
It’s seen in the names she chose for her first three sons (vv.31-35).
Reuben means “See, a Son”; Simeon means “Heard”; and Levi means
“Attached.” Their names were all plays on words that indicated the
lack of love she felt from Jacob. With each son’s birth, she
desperately hoped she would move up in Jacob’s affections and earn his
love. But slowly Leah’s attitude changed, and she named her fourth son
Judah, which means “Praise” (v.35). Though she felt unloved by her
husband, perhaps she now realized she was greatly loved by God.

We can never “earn” God’s love, because it’s not dependent on what we
do. In truth, the Bible tells us that “while we were still sinners,
Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8). In God’s eyes, we are worth the best
that heaven could offer—the gift of His precious Son.

Reflect & Pray

Love sent the Savior to die in my stead. Why should He love me so?
Meekly to Calvary’s cross He was led. Why should He love me so?
—Harkness

Nothing speaks more clearly of God’s love than the cross.
