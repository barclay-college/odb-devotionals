Come and Get It!

Give ear and come to me; listen, that you may live.
Isaiah 55:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 55:1–6

I peeked over the grape-stake fence that encloses our backyard. There
I saw folks running, jogging, walking, and shuffling around the track
that surrounds the park behind our home. I used to do that when I was
stronger, I thought. And a wave of dissatisfaction washed over me.

Later, while reading the Scriptures, I came across Isaiah 55:1, “Come,
all you who are thirsty,” and I realized again that dissatisfaction
(thirst) is the rule, not the exception in this life. Nothing, not
even the good things of life, can fully satisfy. If I had strong legs
like a Sherpa (mountain-climbing guide), there would still be
something else in my life that I’d be unhappy about.

Our culture is always telling us in one way or another that something
we do, buy, wear, spray on, roll on, or ride in will give us endless
pleasure. But that’s a lie. We can’t get complete satisfaction from
anything in the here and now, no matter what we do.

Rather, Isaiah invites us to come again and again to God and the
Scriptures to hear what He has to say. And what does He say? His love
for David of old is “everlasting” and “faithful” (v. 3). And that goes
for you and me as well! We can “come” to Him.

Reflect & Pray

In what ways are you thirsty? How can knowing God is faithful help you
today?

Whom have we, Lord, but Thee, soul thirst to satisfy? Exhaustless
spring! The waters free! All other streams are dry. Mary Bowley
