Stones of Remembrance

Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he
pronounced.
Psalm 105:5

Today's Scripture: Joshua 3:14–4:7

Some mornings when I go online, Facebook shows me “memories”—things
I’ve posted on that day in previous years. These memories, such as
photos from my brother’s wedding or a video of my daughter playing
with my grandmother, usually make me smile. But sometimes they have a
more profound emotional effect. When I see a note about a visit to my
brother-in-law during his chemotherapy or a picture of the staples
across my mother’s scalp after her brain surgery three years ago, I am
reminded of God’s faithful presence during difficult circumstances.
These Facebook memories nudge me towards prayer and gratitude.

All of us are prone to forget the things God has done for us. We need
reminders. When Joshua led God’s people towards their new home, they
had to cross the Jordan River (Joshua 3:15–16). God parted the waters,
and His people walked through on dry land (v. 17). To create a
memorial of this miracle, they took twelve stones from the middle of
the riverbed and stacked them on the other side (4:3, 6–7). When
others asked what the stones meant, God’s people would tell the story
of what God had done that day.

Physical reminders of God’s faithfulness in the past can remind us to
trust Him in the present—and with the future.
