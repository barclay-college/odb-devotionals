Immeasurably More

He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. —
1 John 4:4

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 3:14-21

“It’s not going to happen, Aunt Julie. You might as well erase that
thought from your mind.”

“I know it’s unlikely,” I said. “But it’s not impossible.”

For several years, my niece and I have had variations of that
conversation regarding a situation in our family. The rest of the
sentence, which I said only occasionally, was this: “I know it can
happen because I hear stories all the time about how God makes
impossible things happen.” The part of the sentence I said only to
myself was this: “But they happen only in other people’s families.”

Recently my pastor has been preaching from the book of Ephesians. At
the end of every service we say this benediction: “Now to Him who is
able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to
His power that is at work within us, to Him be glory in the church and
in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen”
(Eph. 3:20-21 niv).

This was the year God chose to do “immeasurably more” in my family. He
replaced indifference with love. How did He do it? Beats me. But I saw
it happen. And why should I be surprised? If Satan can turn love into
indifference, certainly God can change indifference back into love.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for doing immeasurably more in our lives than we could
ever imagine. I am so thankful that You are able and often do make
impossible situations possible.

God’s power to restore is stronger than Satan’s power to destroy.
