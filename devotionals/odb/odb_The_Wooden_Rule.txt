The Wooden Rule

The body is not one member but many. —
1 Corinthians 12:14

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 12:14-26

Legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden had an interesting rule
for his teams. Whenever a player scored, he was to acknowledge the
person on the team who had assisted. When he was coaching high school,
one of his players asked, “Coach, won’t that take up too much time?”
Wooden replied, “I’m not asking you to run over there and give him a
big hug. A nod will do.”

To achieve victory on the basketball court, Wooden saw the importance
of teaching his players that they were a team—not “just a bunch of
independent operators.” Each person contributed to the success of
everyone else.

That reminds me of the way the body of Christ should work. According
to 1 Corinthians 12:19-20, each of us is a separate part of one body.
“If they were all one member, where would the body be? But . . . there
are many members, yet one body.” Is the success of a pastor, a Bible
study, or a church program based solely on one person’s
accomplishments? How many people contribute to the smooth operation of
a church, a Christian organization, a family?

Coach Wooden’s rule and 1 Corinthians 12 are both rooted in the
principle of seeing our need for one another. Let’s use our gifts
within the body of Christ to build up, strengthen, and help to carry
out God’s purposes (vv.1-11).
