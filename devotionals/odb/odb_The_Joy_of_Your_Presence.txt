The Joy of Your Presence

Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above
all gods.
Psalm 96:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 145:1-18

“Man’s chief end is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever,” says the
Westminster Catechism. Much of Scripture calls for joyful gratitude
and adoration of the living God. When we honor God, we celebrate Him
as the Source from which all goodness flows.

When we praise God from our heart we find ourselves in that joyful
state for which we were created. Just as a beautiful sunset or a
peaceful pastoral scene points to the majesty of the Creator, so
worship draws us into a close spiritual union with Him. The psalmist
says, “Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise . . . . The Lord is
near to all who call on him” (Ps. 145:3,18).

God does not need our praise, but we need to praise God. By basking in
His presence we drink in the joy of His infinite love and rejoice in
the One who came to redeem and restore us. “In your presence there is
fullness of joy,” the psalmist says. “At your right hand are pleasures
forevermore” (Ps. 16:11 esv).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, You are the great and mighty God, the Creator of the
universe. I will praise Your name always. There is no God besides You.

Worship is a heart overflowing with praise to God.
