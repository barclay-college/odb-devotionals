I’m Sorry, Man

Be reconciled to your brother. —
Matthew 5:24

Today's Scripture: Matthew 5:21-26

When my son-in-law Ewing and I attended a sporting event, we enjoyed
watching both the game and the people around us.

One of those people showed both the bad and good side of humanity.
This man had apparently lost track of his seat. As he was looking for
it, he stood squarely between us and the field. A man sitting in front
of us also had his view blocked, so he told the guy, “Could you move?
We can’t see.”

The lost man responded sarcastically, “Too bad.” A second request got
a similar but more heated response. Finally the man moved on. Later
came a surprise. He returned and told the man he had blocked, “Hey,
I’m sorry, man. I was upset that I couldn’t find my seat.” They shook
hands and the incident ended well.

That interaction made me think. As we go through life striving to find
our way, situations may frustrate us and cause us to respond to others
in an un-Christlike way. If so, we must ask God to give us the courage
to apologize to those we have offended. Our worship, according to
Jesus, depends on it (Matt. 5:23-24).

We honor God when we make reconciliation with others a priority. After
we have been reconciled, we can then fully enjoy communion with our
heavenly Father.

Reflect & Pray

It’s not easy, Lord, to swallow our pride and ask others to forgive
us. But You want us to seek reconciliation before worship can take
place. Help us to seek forgiveness when necessary.

Confession of sin is the soil in which forgiveness flourishes.
