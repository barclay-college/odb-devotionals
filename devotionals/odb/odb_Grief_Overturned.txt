Grief Overturned

I have seen the Lord!
John 20:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 20:11–18

According to Jim and Jamie Dutcher, filmmakers known for their
knowledge of wolves, when happy, wolves wag their tails and romp
about. But after the death of a pack member, they grieve for weeks.
They visit the place where the pack member died, showing grief by
their drooping tails and mournful howls.

Grief is a powerful emotion we’ve all experienced, particularly at the
death of a loved one or of a treasured hope. Mary Magdalene
experienced it. She’d traveled with and helped support Jesus and His
disciples (Luke 8:1–3). But His cruel death on a cross separated them.
The only thing left for Mary to do for Jesus was to finish anointing
His body for burial—a task the Sabbath had interrupted. But imagine
how Mary felt when she found not a lifeless, broken body but a living
Savior! Though she hadn’t at first recognized the man standing before
her, when He spoke her name, she knew who He was—Jesus! Instantly,
grief turned to joy. Mary now had joyful news to share: “I have seen
the Lord!” (John 20:18).

Jesus entered our dark world to bring freedom and life. His
resurrection celebrates that He accomplished what He set out to do.
Watch the devotional video, “Jesus, the Resurrection,” to learn more
about the joy of a new life in Christ. We too can celebrate His
resurrection and share the good news: He’s alive!
