Still In God’s Hands

In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong. —
Job 1:22

Today's Scripture: Job 1:13-22

During my first year of seminary, I listened as a new friend described
her life. Abandoned by her husband, she was raising two small children
alone. Earning just over minimum wage, she had little chance of
escaping the poverty and dangers she described in her neighborhood.

As a father, I was moved by her concern for her children, and asked,
“How do you handle all of this?” She seemed surprised by my question
and replied, “We are doing all we can do, and I must leave them in
God’s hands.” Her trust in God in the midst of trials reminded me of
Job’s trust (1:6-22).

A year later, she phoned and asked if I would come be with her at the
funeral home. Her son had been killed in a drive-by shooting. I asked
God for words to comfort her and for the wisdom not to try to explain
the unexplainable.

Standing with her that day, however, I marveled as again and again she
comforted others—her confidence in God unshaken by this terrible blow.
Turning to me as we parted, her final words were a poignant reminder
of the depth of her faith: “My boy is still in God’s hands.” Like Job,
she “did not sin nor charge God with wrong”(v.22).

We too can develop an unshakable faith by daily walking with the Lord.

Reflect & Pray

O the peace I find in Jesus, Peace no power on earth can shake, Peace
that makes the Lord so precious, Peace that none from me can take.
—Beck

Nothing can shake those who are secure in God’s hands.
