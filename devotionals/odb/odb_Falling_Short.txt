Falling Short

All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. —
Romans 3:23

Today's Scripture: Romans 3:19-28

One of the fads of 1970s America was the motorcycle jump. This trend
reached its high (and low) point on September 8, 1974. Thousands of
spectators gathered around the Snake River Canyon in Idaho to see if
Evel Knievel could jump across the chasm in a specially designed “sky
cycle.” In the end, however, it was unsuccessful. Knievel made it only
part of the way across the gulf before his parachute deployed and he
dropped to the canyon floor below. Some spectators asked, “How far
across the canyon did he get?” But that wasn’t the point. He didn’t
make it all the way across, so he fell short of his goal.

This scene is a good illustration of sin. The Bible talks about sin in
Romans 3:23, where Paul declared, “All have sinned and fall short of
the glory of God.” No one is capable of bridging the gap between God
and ourselves by our own efforts, but the Savior came to do just that
on our behalf. Christ perfectly fulfilled God’s standards, then gave
His life on the cross to pay for our failure and wrongdoing. Where we
could only fall short, Christ’s work, offered in love, accomplished
all that was needed.

Our response is to trust Him and receive this matchless gift of
salvation.

Reflect & Pray

There is no other name on earth By whom salvation’s given Save Jesus
Christ the Lamb of God, God’s precious gift from heaven. —Stairs

The cross of Christ bridges the gap we could never cross on our own.
