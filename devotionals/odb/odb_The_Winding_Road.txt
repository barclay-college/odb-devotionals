The Winding Road

He will not allow your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not
slumber. —
Psalm 121:3

Today's Scripture: Psalm 121

In his book A Sweet and Bitter Providence, John Piper offers these
thoughts about God’s providence and guidance: “Life is not a straight
line leading from one blessing to the next and then finally to heaven.
Life is a winding and troubled road. . . . God is not just showing up
after the trouble and cleaning it up. He is plotting the course and
managing the troubles with far-reaching purposes for our good and for
the glory of Jesus Christ.”

The Jews journeying to Jerusalem for the annual feasts (Deut. 16:16)
had the assurance of knowing that the Lord was plotting their course
and managing the winding and troubled roads for them. They expressed
this assurance in Psalm 121, a pilgrim song. The question, “From
whence comes my help?” did not express doubt but affirmation in the
Lord who rules supreme (vv.1-2). Unlike a guard who sometimes
slumbered, or the god Baal who needed to be rustled out of his stupor
(1 Kings 18:27), the Lord was fully alert and secured the journey of
His people with providential care (vv.3-4). The Lord, who rescued
Israel, would continue to help, preserve, and walk with His people.

Life is a winding road with unknown perils and troubles, but we can be
certain of God’s providence, security, and care.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, sometimes life seems to be full of perilous and winding
roads. Thank You for giving us the assurance that You have our course
plotted and are watching over our every step.

Troubles are unknown; God’s providence is certain.
