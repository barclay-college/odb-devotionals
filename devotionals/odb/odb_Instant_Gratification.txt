Instant Gratification

Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your
heart. —
Psalm 27:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 27:4-14

When the Polaroid SX-70 camera was introduced in 1972, it
revolutionized photography. An article by Owen Edward in Smithsonian
magazine described the camera as “a miracle of physics, optics and
electronics.” When a photo was snapped, “a blank square would emerge
from the front of the camera and develop before our eyes.” People were
sold on speedy, immediate results.

Oswald Chambers saw a strong connection between our desire for the
immediate and lust: “Lust simply means, ‘I must have this at once’; it
may be a bodily appetite or a spiritual possession. . . . I cannot
wait for God’s time, God is too indifferent; that is the way lust
works.”

In Psalm 27, David wrote of his waiting on God during a time of great
trouble when there was no solution in sight. Instead of giving in to
despair, he maintained his confidence that he would “see the goodness
of the Lord in the land of the living” (v.13).

We live in a world that worships the immediate. When it seems there is
no sign of our deepest longings being fulfilled, the psalmist urges us
to cling to the eternal God. “Wait on the Lord; be of good courage,
and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, on the Lord!” (v.14).

Reflect & Pray

Help me, O Lord, to be content! My lips to seal, To every vain desire,
each whim—instead to kneel, Acknowledging Thee, Lord and King, and in
that place To kneel, to pray, to wait until I see Thy face! —Adams

The answer to our craving for the immediate is to focus on the
eternal.
