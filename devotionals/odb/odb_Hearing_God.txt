Hearing God

Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”
1 Samuel 3:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Samuel 3:1–10

I felt like I was underwater, sounds muffled and muted by a cold and
allergies. For weeks I struggled to hear clearly. My condition made me
realize how much I take my hearing for granted.

Young Samuel in the temple must have wondered what he was hearing as
he struggled out of sleep at the summons of his name (1 Sam. 3:4).
Three times he presented himself before Eli, the high priest. Only the
third time did Eli realize it was the Lord speaking to Samuel. The
word of the Lord had been rare at that time (v. 1), and the people
were not in tune with His voice. But Eli instructed Samuel how to
respond (v. 9).

The Lord speaks much more now than in the days of Samuel. The letter
to the Hebrews tells us, “In the past God spoke to our ancestors
through the prophets . . . but in these last days he has spoken to us
by his Son” (1:1–2). And in Acts 2 we read of the coming of the Holy
Spirit at Pentecost (vv. 1–4), who guides us in the things Christ
taught us (John 16:13). But we need to learn to hear His voice and
respond in obedience. Like me with my cold, we may hear as if
underwater. We need to test what we think is the Lord’s guidance with
the Bible and with other mature Christians. As God’s beloved children,
we do hear His voice. He loves to speak life into us.

Reflect & Pray

Open our eyes, Lord, that we might see You. Open our ears, that we may
hear You. Open our mouths, that we might speak Your praise.

The Lord speaks to His children, but we need to discern His voice.
