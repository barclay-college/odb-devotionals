Just Do What’s Right

That you may become . . . children of God without fault in the midst
of a crooked and perverse generation. —
Philippians 2:15

Today's Scripture: Philippians 2:12-18

On a trip out of the country, I happened to meet an attorney who was
from my hometown in New Jersey. We were surprised at how much we had
in common. In the course of the conversation, he asked, “Did you say
your name was Stillwell?” I said, “No, it’s Stowell.” He then
mentioned that he had a client named Stillwell. “Is it Art Stillwell?”
I asked, and, to my surprise, he said yes. Art Stillwell attended my
church and was an influential businessman in the community.

The attorney admitted that he had no client quite like Art. He
explained that most of his clients want him to do whatever it takes to
get them out of their problems, but Art was different. Whenever he
asked Art what to do in any given situation, Art always replied, “Just
do what’s right!” Obviously it had made an impression on the attorney.

Yielding to Christ in all of our desires and decisions regardless of
the outcome is what sets us apart in a world full of people consumed
by their own interests. When we live blameless lives “without
fault”—courageously reflecting the integrity, love, and grace of
Jesus—we clearly “shine as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15).

So, if you want to light up your world in a compelling way, just do
what’s right!
