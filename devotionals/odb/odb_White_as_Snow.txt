White as Snow

Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
Isaiah 1:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 1:16–20

Last December, my family and I went to the mountains. We had lived in
a tropical climate all our lives, so it was the first time we could
see snow in all its magnificence. As we contemplated the white mantle
covering the fields, my husband quoted Isaiah, “Though your sins are
like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow” (Isaiah 1:18).

After asking about the meaning of scarlet, our three-year-old daughter
asked, “Is the color red bad?” She knows sins are things God dislikes,
but this verse is not talking about colors. The prophet was describing
the bright red dye obtained from the eggs of a small insect. Clothes
would be double-dyed in this bright red so the color became fixed.
Neither rain nor washing would remove it. Sin is like that. No human
effort can take it away. It’s rooted in the heart.

Only God can cleanse a heart from sin. And as we looked at the
mountains, we admired the pure whiteness that scrubbing and bleaching
a piece of cloth dyed in scarlet red can’t achieve. When we follow
Peter’s teaching, “Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins
may be wiped out” (Acts 3:19), God forgives us and gives us a new
life. Only through Jesus’s sacrifice can we receive what no one else
can give—a pure heart. What a wonderful gift!

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for forgiving our sins and wiping them clean.

When God forgives, He purifies us too.
