A Fly’s Reminder

Anyone who is among the living has hope.
Ecclesiastes 9:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 9:4-12

When I first began working in the small office I now rent, the only
inhabitants were a few mopey flies. Several of them had gone the way
of all flesh, and their bodies littered the floor and windowsills. I
disposed of all but one, which I left in plain sight.

That fly carcass reminds me to live each day well. Death is an
excellent reminder of life, and life is a gift. Solomon said, “Anyone
who is among the living has hope” (Eccl. 9:4). Life on earth gives us
the chance to influence and enjoy the world around us. We can eat and
drink happily and relish our relationships (vv. 7,9).

We can also enjoy our work. Solomon advised, “Whatever your hand finds
to do, do it with all your might” (v. 10). Whatever our vocation or
job or role in life, we can still do things that matter, and do them
well. We can encourage people, pray, and express love with sincerity
each day.

The writer of Ecclesiastes says, “Time and chance happen to them all.
. . . No one knows when their hour will come” (vv. 11-12). It’s
impossible to know when our lives on earth will end, but gladness and
purpose can be found in this day by relying on God’s strength and
depending on Jesus’ promise of eternal life (John 6:47).
