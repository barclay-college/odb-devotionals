Blessed Are The Meek

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. —
Matthew 5:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 5:1-10

One problem with the English word meek is that it rhymes with weak,
and people have linked the two words together for years. A popular
dictionary offers a secondary definition of meek as “too submissive;
easily imposed on; spineless; spiritless.” This causes some people to
question why Jesus would say, “Blessed are the meek, for they shall
inherit the earth” (Matt. 5:5).

Greek scholar W. E. Vine says that meekness in the Bible is an
attitude toward God “in which we accept His dealings with us as good,
and therefore without disputing or resisting.” We see this in Jesus
who found His delight in doing the will of His Father.

Vine goes on to say that “the meekness manifested by the Lord and
commended to the believer is the fruit of power. . . . The Lord was
‘meek’ because He had the infinite resources of God at His command.”
He could have called angels from heaven to prevent His crucifixion.

Jesus told His weary, burdened followers, “Take My yoke upon you and
learn from Me, for I am [meek] and lowly in heart, and you will find
rest for your souls” (Matt. 11:29). He was the perfect model of
meekness.

When we are tired and troubled, Jesus invites us to discover the peace
of meekly trusting Him.

Love sent the Savior to die in my stead. Why should He love me so?
Meekly to Calvary’s cross He was led. Why should He love me so?
