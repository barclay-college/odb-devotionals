Following Our Example

Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers. —
1 Timothy 4:12

Today's Scripture: 1 Timothy 4:12-16

Alyssa, who is 6 and just learning to read, often saw her parents and
grandparents reading their Bibles in the morning. Early one day, she
woke up before everyone else. Grandma found her sitting on the couch,
with her Bible and a devotional booklet on her lap. She wanted to
follow the example of spending time with God at the beginning of the
day.

Timothy, a young pastor, faced heavy responsibilities in the church at
Ephesus—training believers, leading in worship, countering false
doctrine. The older, experienced apostle Paul gave him instruction on
leading the church in these areas, but he also mentioned the
importance of personal conduct. He said, “Be an example to the
believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in
purity” (1 Tim. 4:12).

Paul challenged Timothy: “Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine”
(v.16). If he paid attention to his own spiritual life and to solid
doctrine, he would be a godly example to the church family.

We all have others who are observing us. Even little Alyssa has
younger siblings watching her. Let’s live our lives in such a way that
those who follow our example will help others in their walk with God.
