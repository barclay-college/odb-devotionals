Crying Out To God

By prayer and supplication . . . let your requests be made known to
God. —
Philippians 4:6

Today's Scripture: Psalm 142

After all these years, I still don’t fully understand prayer. It’s
something of a mystery to me. But one thing I know: When we’re in
desperate need, prayer springs naturally from our lips and from the
deepest level of our hearts.

When we’re frightened out of our wits, when we’re pushed beyond our
limits, when we’re pulled out of our comfort zones, when our well-
being is challenged and endangered, we reflexively and involuntarily
resort to prayer. “Help, Lord!” is our natural cry.

Author Eugene Peterson wrote: “The language of prayer is forged in the
crucible of trouble. When we can’t help ourselves and call for help,
when we don’t like where we are and want out, when we don’t like who
we are and want a change, we use primal language, and this language
becomes the root language of prayer.”

Prayer begins in trouble, and it continues because we’re always in
trouble at some level. It requires no special preparation, no precise
vocabulary, no appropriate posture. It springs from us in the face of
necessity and, in time, becomes our habitual response to every
issue—good and bad—we face in this life (Phil. 4:6). What a privilege
it is to carry everything to God in prayer!
