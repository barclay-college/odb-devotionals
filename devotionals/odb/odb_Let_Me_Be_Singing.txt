Let Me Be Singing

Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. —
Psalm 150:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 150

When I asked a friend how his mother was getting along, he told me
that dementia had robbed her of the ability to remember a great many
names and events from the past. “Even so,” he added, “she can still
sit down at the piano and, without sheet music, beautifully play hymns
by memory.”

Plato and Aristotle wrote about the helping, healing power of music
2,500 years ago. But centuries before that, the biblical record was
saturated with song.

From the first mention of Jubal, “the father of all those who play the
harp and flute” (Gen. 4:21), to those who “sing the song of Moses, the
servant of God and the song of the Lamb” (Rev. 15:3), the pages of the
Bible resonate with music. The Psalms, often called “the Bible’s
songbook,” point us to the love and faithfulness of God. They conclude
with an unending call to worship, “Let everything that has breath
praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!” (Ps. 150:6).

Today we need God’s ministry of music in our hearts as much as any
time in history. Whatever each day brings, may the evening find us
singing, “To You, O my Strength, I will sing praises; for God is my
defense, my God of mercy” (59:17).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I don’t know what will come this day or farther into the future,
but I’m grateful that You’re by my side. Grant me a spirit of praise
and thanksgiving in whatever lies ahead.

Praise to God comes naturally when you count your blessings.
