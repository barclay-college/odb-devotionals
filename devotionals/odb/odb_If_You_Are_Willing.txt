“If You Are Willing”

Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean. —
Matthew 8:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 8:1-4

Molly wanted her dad’s help, but she was afraid to ask. She knew that
when he was working on his computer, he didn’t want to be interrupted.
He might get upset at me, she thought, so she didn’t ask him.

We need not have such fears when we come to Jesus. In Matthew 8:1-4,
we read about a leper who didn’t hesitate to interrupt Jesus with his
needs. His disease made him desperate—he had been ostracized from
society and was in emotional distress. Jesus was busy with “great
multitudes,” but the leper made his way through the crowd to talk with
Jesus.

Matthew’s gospel says that the leper came and “worshiped Him” (v.2).
He approached Jesus in worship, with trust in His power, and with
humility, acknowledging that the choice to help belonged to Jesus. He
said, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean” (v.2). In
compassion, Jesus touched him (leprosy had made him “untouchable” by
the standards of Jewish law), and he was cleansed immediately.

Like the leper, we don’t need to hesitate to approach Jesus with our
desire for His help. As we go to Him in humility and worship, we can
trust that He will make the best choices for us.

Reflect & Pray

What an example this leper is to me, Lord. Give me a heart of worship,
of confidence in Your power, and of trust that when I bring my needs
to You, You’ll make the best choice. May I surrender to Your will.

Let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy.
—Hebrews 4:16
