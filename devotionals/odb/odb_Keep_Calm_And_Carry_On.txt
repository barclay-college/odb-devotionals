Keep Calm And Carry On

We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth. —
Ezra 5:11

Today's Scripture: Ezra 5:7-17

“Keep calm and call mom.” “Keep calm and eat bacon.” “Keep calm and
put the kettle on.” These sayings originate from the phrase: “Keep
Calm and Carry On.” This message first appeared in Great Britain as
World War II began in 1939. British officials printed it on posters
designed to offset panic and discouragement during the war.

Having returned to the land of Israel after a time of captivity, the
Israelites had to overcome their own fear and enemy interference as
they began to rebuild the temple (Ezra 3:3). Once they finished the
foundation, their opponents “hired counselors against them to
frustrate their purpose” (4:5). Israel’s enemies also wrote accusing
letters to government officials and successfully delayed the project
(vv.6,24). Despite this, King Darius eventually issued a decree that
allowed them to complete the temple (6:12-14).

When we are engaged in God’s work and we encounter setbacks, we can
calmly carry on because, like the Israelites, “We are the servants of
the God of heaven and earth” (5:11). Obstacles and delays may
discourage us, but we can rest in Jesus’ promise: “I will build my
church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it” (Matt. 16:18
nlt). It is God’s power that enables His work, not our own.
