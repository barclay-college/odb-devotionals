Now Go!

Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say. —
Exodus 4:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 4:10-17

More than 10,000 evangelists and Christian leaders sat in a giant
auditorium in Amsterdam in 1986 listening to world-renowned evangelist
Billy Graham. I sat among them, listening as he narrated some of his
experiences. Then, to my surprise, he said, “Let me tell you: every
time I stand before the congregation of God’s people to preach, I
tremble and my knees wobble!”

What! I wondered. How can such a great preacher who has enthralled
millions with his powerful sermons exhibit trembling and wobbling
knees? Then he went on to describe not fear and stage fright, but
intense humility and meekness as he felt inadequate for the daunting
task to which God had called him. He relied on God for strength, not
on his own eloquence.

Moses felt inadequate when God sent him to deliver the enslaved
Israelites from their 400-year captivity in Egypt. Moses pleaded with
the Lord to send someone else, with the excuse that he had never been
a good speaker (see Ex. 4:10,13).

We may have similar fears when God calls us to do something for Him.
But His encouragement to Moses can also spur us on: “Now go; I will
help you speak and will teach you what to say” (v.12 niv).

As Billy Graham said that day, “When God calls you, do not be afraid
of trembling and wobbling knees, for He will be with you!”

What task does God have for you to do today? Depend on Him by asking
for His help.

Wherever God sends us, He comes alongside us.
