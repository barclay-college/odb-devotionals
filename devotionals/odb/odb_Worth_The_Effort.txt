Worth The Effort?

All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for .
. . righteousness. —
2 Timothy 3:16

Today's Scripture: Psalm 19:7-11

I once resolved to read all 38 of Shakespeare’s plays in one year. To
my surprise, fulfilling the task seemed far more like entertainment
than work. I expected to learn about Shakespeare’s world and the
people who inhabited it, but I found that Shakespeare mainly taught me
about my world.

I went through precisely that same process in encountering the Old
Testament. Why does it spend so much time on temples, priests, and
rules about sacrifices that no longer exist? How can we make sense of
the Old Testament, and how does it apply to our lives today?

As I worked past some of the barriers, I came to feel a need to read
because of what it was teaching me. Eventually I found myself wanting
to read those 39 books. They were satisfying a hunger in me that
nothing else had. They taught me about life with God.

The Old Testament speaks to our hunger. It gives an advanced course of
“Life With God,” expressed in a style both personal and passionate.

The rewards offered do not come easily. All achievements require a
similar process of hard work; we persevere because the rewards will
come.

Reflect & Pray

A glory gilds the sacred page, Majestic like the sun; It gives a light
to every age, It gives, but borrows none. —Cowper

The Bible gives us a picture of who we really are.
