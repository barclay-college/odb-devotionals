Where Did I Come From?

[God] has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the
face of the earth. —
Acts 17:26

Today's Scripture: Acts 17:22-31

My 7-year-old African-American friend Tobias asked me a thought-
provoking question the other day: “Since Adam and Eve were white,
where did black people come from?” When I told him we don’t know what
“color” they were and asked him why he thought they were white, he
said that’s what he always saw in Bible-story books at church and in
the library. My heart sank. I wondered if that might make him think he
was inferior or possibly not even created by the Lord.

All people have their roots in the Creator God, and therefore all are
equal. That’s what the apostle Paul told the Athenians: “[God] has
made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of
the earth” (Acts 17:26). We are all “from one blood.” Darrell Bock, in
his commentary on the book of Acts, says, “This affirmation would be
hard for the Athenians, who prided themselves in being a superior
people, calling others barbarians.” However, because we all descended
from our first parents, Adam and Eve, no race nor ethnicity is
superior or inferior to another.

We stand in awe of our Creator, who made us and gives to all “life,
breath, and all things” (v.25). Equal in God’s sight, we together
praise and honor Him.

Reflect & Pray

Every life has been created— God’s handiwork displayed; When we
cherish His creation, We value what He’s made. —Sper

God loves each of us as if there were only one of us.
