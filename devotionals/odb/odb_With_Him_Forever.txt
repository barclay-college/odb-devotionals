With Him Forever!

For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little
time and then vanishes away. —
James 4:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 4:11-17

In 1859, during the turbulent years prior to America’s Civil War,
Abraham Lincoln had the opportunity to speak to the Agricultural
Society in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As he spoke, he shared with them the
story of an ancient monarch’s search for a sentence that was “true and
appropriate in all times and situations.” His wise men, faced with
this heady challenge, gave him the sentence, “And this, too, shall
pass away.”

This is certainly true of our present world—it is constantly in the
process of deterioration. And it’s not happening just to the world; we
also face the reality in our own lives that our days are numbered.
James wrote, “For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears
for a little time and then vanishes away” (James 4:14).

Although our current life is temporary and will pass away, the God we
worship and serve is eternal. He has shared that eternity with us
through the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ. He promises us a life that
will never pass away: “For God so loved the world that He gave His
only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but
have everlasting life” (John 3:16).

When Christ returns, He will take us home to be with Him forever!
