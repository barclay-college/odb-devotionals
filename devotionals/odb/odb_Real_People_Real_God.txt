Real People, Real God

Join together in following my example.
Philippians 3:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:17-21

Several years ago I received a letter from an Our Daily Bread reader
after I had written about a family tragedy. “When you told about your
tragedy,” this person wrote, “I realized that the writers were real
people with real problems.” How true that is! I look across the list
of men and women who pen these articles, and I see cancer and wayward
children and unfulfilled dreams and many other kinds of loss. We are
indeed just regular, real people writing about a real God who
understands our real problems.

The apostle Paul stands out in the Real People Hall of Fame. He had
physical problems. He had legal issues. He had interpersonal
relationship struggles to deal with. And in all of this messy reality,
he was setting an example for us. In Philippians 3:17, he said, “Join
together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as
you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do.”

Those around us who need the gospel—who need Jesus—are looking for
believable people who can point them to our perfect Savior. And that
means we must be real.

Reflect & Pray

You, Lord, are perfection. Yet You welcome us imperfect people to come
to You for salvation. You sent Your perfect Son to earth to die for
us. Help us to be real and genuine as we seek to point people to You.

If we are true to God, we will not be false to people.
