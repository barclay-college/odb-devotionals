Your Bio Here

And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. —
John 1:14

Today's Scripture: John 1:1-14

While searching for an interesting way to instruct my college writing
class about the concept of writing a biographical sketch, I found this
idea: Write a biography in six words. When asked to do this, Pulitzer
Prize winner Ernest Hemingway wrote this poignant bio: “For sale: baby
shoes, never used.” Imagine the sad story behind those six words.

As I thought about this concept, I wondered if we could find any six-
word biographies of people in the Bible. What I discovered was
astonishing. Many of our scriptural heroes have already been described
that way. For example, David, of whom God said: “A man after My own
heart” (1 Sam. 13:14; Acts 13:22). Or Paul’s self-description: “Paul,
an apostle of Jesus Christ” (Eph. 1:1). Or Paul’s description of
Timothy: “My true son in the faith” (1 Tim. 1:2 NIV). And consider
these words about Mary: “The virgin shall be with child” (Matt. 1:23).
And about Jesus: “Became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14).

This exercise in precise descriptions of people of faith should cause
us to wonder: What six-word description would best describe me? Would
it be positive or negative? Would it be “Not an easy person to love”
or “A shining light for the Lord”? What would your bio say?
