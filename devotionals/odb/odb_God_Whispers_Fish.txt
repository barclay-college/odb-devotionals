God Whispers “Fish”

From now on you will catch men. —
Luke 5:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 5:1-10

A number of years ago our sons and I enjoyed some days together
drifting and fishing the Madison River in Montana with two fishing
guides who also served as our boatmen.

The guide I drew was a man who had lived on the river all his life and
knew where the big trout held. He was a quiet man who spoke scarcely
two dozen words in all the time he was with us, but his few words
enlivened my days.

We were fishing with small flies in choppy water. My eyesight was not
what it once was, and I was missing most of the takes. My guide—who
was also a soul of patience—began to alert me by murmuring “fish” when
he saw a trout rising under the fly. When I heard his cue, I lifted
the tip of my rod and . . . voilà! A trout on the end of my line!

I’ve often thought of that guide and Jesus’ declaration to His
fishermen-disciples, “From now on you will catch men” (Luke 5:10).
There are great opportunities that come our way every day—people
circling around us, searching for that elusive “something” for which
their souls crave—occasions to show the love of Christ and speak of
the hope that is in us. These are opportunities we might miss if not
alerted.

May the Great Angler, who knows every heart, whisper “fish” in our
ears and may we have ears to hear.

Reflect & Pray

All through this day, O Lord, let me touch as many lives as possible
for You—through the words I speak, the prayers I breathe, the letters
I write, and the life I live.

When the Spirit prompts, take action.
