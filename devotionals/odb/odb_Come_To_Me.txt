Come To Me

Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed. —
John 20:29

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 20:24-31

Charlotte Elliott wrote the hymn “Just As I Am” in 1834. She had been
an invalid for many years, and though she wanted to help with a fund-
raiser for a girl’s school, she was too ill. She felt useless, and
this inner distress caused her to begin doubting her faith in Christ.
She wrote “Just As I Am” as a response to her doubt. The crux of her
distress is perhaps best expressed in these words:

Just as I am, though tossed about With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without, O Lamb of God, I come!

Three days after His death and burial, Jesus rose from the grave and
invited the disciple whom history has nicknamed “Doubting Thomas” to
examine the marks of His crucifixion (John 20:27). When Thomas touched
Jesus’ wounds, he finally believed in the resurrection. Christ
responded, “Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed.
Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (v.29).

As Christians today, we are the ones who have not seen but still
believe. Yet at times our earthly circumstances create serious
questions in our souls. Even then, we cry out: “Lord, I believe; help
my unbelief!” (Mark 9:24). Jesus welcomes us to come to Him just as we
are.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Jesus, help me to trust You when life doesn’t make sense. Please
take my doubt and replace it with fresh faith in You.

The risen Christ opens the door for you to have fullness of life.
