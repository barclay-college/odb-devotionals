Who Gets The Credit?

Let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me. —
Jeremiah 9:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 9:23-26

Chris Langan has an IQ higher than Albert Einstein’s. Moustafa Ismail
has 31-inch biceps and can lift 600 pounds. Bill Gates is estimated to
be worth billions. Those who have extraordinary abilities or
possessions might be tempted to think more highly of themselves than
they should. But we don’t have to be wildly smart, strong, or wealthy
to want to take credit for our achievements. Any size of
accomplishment carries with it this question: Who will get the credit?

During a time of judgment, God spoke to the Israelites through the
prophet Jeremiah. He said: “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
let not the mighty man glory in his might, nor let the rich man glory
in his riches” (Jer. 9:23). Rather, “Let him who glories glory in
this, that he understands and knows Me” (v.24). God wanted His people
to prize Him and His excellence above anything else.

If we allow praise to inflate our self-image, we’re forgetting that
“every good gift . . . comes down from the Father” (James 1:17). It’s
better to give God the glory—not only because it protects our hearts
from pride but also because He rightfully deserves it. He is God, the
One “who does great things . . . marvelous things without number” (Job
5:9).

Reflect & Pray

Not I, but Christ, be honored, loved, exalted; Not I, but Christ, be
seen, be known, be heard; Not I, but Christ, in every look and action;
Not I, but Christ, in every thought and word. —Whiddington

We were created to give God the glory.
