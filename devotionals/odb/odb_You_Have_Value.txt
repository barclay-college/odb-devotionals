You Have Value

You were bought at a price.
1 Corinthians 6:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:6–11

After my mother-in-law died, my wife and I discovered a cache of US
Indian Head pennies in a dresser drawer in her apartment. She wasn’t a
coin collector, as such, but she lived in the era when these pennies
were in circulation and she had accumulated a few.

Some of these coins are in excellent condition; others are not. They
are so worn and tarnished you can hardly see the imprint. All bear the
stamp “One Cent” on the opposite side. Although a penny these days has
little value and many consider them useless, this one-cent coin would
have bought a newspaper in its day. And collectors still find value in
them, even those that have been battered and abused.

Perhaps you feel tarnished, worn, old, or out of circulation. Even so,
God finds value in you. The Creator of the universe wants you—not for
your mind, your body, your clothes, your achievements, your intellect,
or your personality, but because you are you! He would go any distance
and pay any price to possess you (1 Cor. 6:20).

In fact He did. He came down to earth from heaven and purchased you
with His own blood (Rom. 5:6, 8-9). That’s how much He wants you. You
are valuable in His eyes, and He loves you.

Reflect & Pray

As I think about Your love for me, Father, I wonder with amazement how
You could love someone like me—and I praise You.

Christ’s death is the measure of God’s love for you.
