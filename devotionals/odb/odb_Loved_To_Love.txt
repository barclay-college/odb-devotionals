Loved To Love

What does the Lord your God require of you, but . . . to walk in all
His ways and to love Him. —
Deuteronomy 10:12

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 10:12-22

“A heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are
loved by others.” I saw this quotation, attributed to the Wizard of
Oz, on a wall plaque in a gift shop.

The Wizard of Oz may be a good story, but it’s not a reliable source
of spiritual information. God said something quite different.
According to Him, the greatest commandment is to love—to love Him
first and then others (Mark 12:29-31). Scripture says nothing about
expecting to be loved in return. In fact, Jesus stated the opposite in
His most famous sermon: “Blessed are you when they revile and
persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My
sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in
heaven” (Matt. 5:11-12).

When it comes to love, the important thing we need to know is this:
All love starts with God (1 John 4:19). As Moses told the Israelites,
God delighted in them to love them (Deut. 10:15), and because of that
they were to love others, even strangers (v.19). God’s intent is that
the people who receive His love will become the conduit of His love to
others.

Apart from God—who Himself is love—none of us could truly love or be
loved (1 John 4:7-8).

chose a manger and a cross To show that He was Love. — Wilmshurst
