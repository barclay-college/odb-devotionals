His Choice

God from the beginning chose you for salvation. —
2 Thessalonians 2:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Thessalonians 2:13-17

When our children were small, I often prayed with them after we tucked
them into bed. But before I prayed, I sometimes would sit on the edge
of the bed and talk with them. I remember telling our daughter Libby,
“If I could line up all the 4-year-old girls in the world, I would
walk down the line looking for you. After going through the entire
line, I would choose you to be my daughter.” That always put a big
smile on Libby’s face because she knew she was special.

If that was a smile-worthy moment for her, think of the grace-filled
fact that the Creator-God of the universe “from the beginning chose
you for salvation” (2 Thess. 2:13). Before time began, He desired to
make you His own. This is why Scripture often uses the picture of
adoption to communicate the amazing reality that, through no merit or
worthiness of our own, we have been chosen by Him.

This is stunning news! We are “beloved by the Lord” (v.13) and enjoy
the benefits of being part of His family. This glorious truth should
fill our lives with humility and gratitude. “Now may our Lord Jesus
Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us . . .
establish you in every good word and work” (vv.16-17).

Reflect & Pray

I will be forever grateful that I am Your child, Father, and that You
love me! Teach me to remember all the benefits of belonging to You,
and may I serve You faithfully as part of Your family.

It’s God’s choice to love you and to make you part of His family.
