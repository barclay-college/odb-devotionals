The Turn

For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor.
Esther 8:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Esther 8:11–17

As the minister spoke at a funeral for an old military veteran, he
mused about where the deceased might be. But then, instead of telling
the people how they could know God, he speculated about things not
found anywhere in Scripture. Where is the hope? I thought.

At last he asked us to turn to a closing hymn. And as we rose to sing
“How Great Thou Art,” people began to praise God from the depths of
their souls. Within moments, the spirit of the entire room had
changed. Suddenly, surprisingly, in the middle of the third verse my
emotions overwhelmed my voice.

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing, Sent Him to die, I
scarce can take it in; That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, He
bled and died to take away my sin.

Until we sang that great hymn, I had wondered if God was going to show
up at that funeral. In reality, He never leaves. A look at the book of
Esther reveals this truth. The Jews were in exile, and powerful people
wanted to kill them. Yet at the darkest moment, a godless king granted
the right to the enslaved Israelites to defend themselves against
those who sought their demise (Est. 8:11–13). A successful defense and
a celebration ensued (9:17–19).

It should be no surprise when God shows up in the words of a hymn at a
funeral. After all, He turned an attempted genocide into a celebration
and a crucifixion into resurrection and salvation!
