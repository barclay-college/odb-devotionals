Just Enough

Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these
things shall be added to you. —
Matthew 6:33

Today's Scripture: Matthew 6:25-34

I love writing for Our Daily Bread. I confess, however, that sometimes
I whine to my friends about how difficult it is to communicate
everything I would like to say in a short devotional. If only I could
use more than 220 words.

This year when I came to the book of Matthew in my Bible-reading
schedule, I noticed something for the first time. As I was reading
about the temptation of Christ (Matt. 4:1-11), I noticed how short it
was. Matthew used fewer than 250 words to write his account of one of
the most pivotal events in all of Scripture. Then I thought of other
short yet powerful passages: the 23rd Psalm (117 words) and the Lord’s
prayer in Matthew 6:9-13 (66 words).

Clearly, I don’t need more words, I just need to use them well. This
also applies to other areas of life—time, money, space. Scripture
affirms that God meets the needs of those who seek His kingdom and His
righteousness (Matt. 6:33). The psalmist David encourages us, “Those
who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing” (Ps. 34:10).

If today you’re thinking, “I need just a little bit more” of
something, consider instead the possibility that God has given you
“just enough.”

Reflect & Pray

I would be quiet, Lord, and rest content, By grace I would not pine or
fret; With You to guide and care, my joy be this: Not one small need
of mine will You forget! —Bosch

He is rich who is satisfied with what he has.
