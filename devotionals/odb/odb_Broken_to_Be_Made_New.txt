Broken to Be Made New

I know, Lord, that your laws are righteous, and that in faithfulness
you have afflicted me.
Psalm 119:75

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:71–75

During World War II my dad served with the US Army in the South
Pacific. During that time Dad rejected any idea of religion, saying,
“I don’t need a crutch.” Yet the day came when his attitude toward
spiritual things would change forever. Mom had gone into labor with
their third child, and my brother and I went to bed with the
excitement of soon seeing our new brother or sister. When I got out of
bed the next morning, I excitedly asked Dad, “Is it a boy or a girl?”
He replied, “It was a little girl but she was born dead.” We began to
weep together at our loss.

For the first time, Dad took his broken heart to Jesus in prayer. At
that moment he felt an overwhelming sense of peace and comfort from
God, though his daughter would always be irreplaceable. Soon he began
to take an interest in the Bible and continued to pray to the One who
was healing his broken heart. His faith grew through the years. He
became a strong follower of Jesus—serving Him as a Bible-study teacher
and a leader in his church.

Jesus is not a crutch for the weak. He is the source of new spiritual
life! When we’re broken, He can make us new and whole (Ps. 119:75).

Reflect & Pray

What is on your heart that you need to talk with God about? Bring Him
your brokenness and ask Him to make you whole.

Brokenness can lead to wholeness.
