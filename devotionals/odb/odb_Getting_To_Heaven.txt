Getting To Heaven

Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved. —
Acts 16:31

Today's Scripture: Romans 3:21-28

While working with third- and fourth-graders at our church’s Vacation
Bible School, I decided to give all 25 of the children a gift on the
last day. But I told them that in order to receive it, they would each
have to tell me how a person can get to heaven.

It was interesting to hear what these 9- and 10-year-olds said. Many
were clear that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ, but some
were not yet equipped to explain the gospel. “You have to be good and
go to Sunday school,” said one. Another asked tentatively, “You have
to pray to God?” Still another: “If you are nice to your friends and
obey your mom and dad.”

As I gently tried to direct the thinking of each child to the central
element of salvation—faith in Jesus who died to pay for our sins and
then rose again—I thought that these kids represented so many others
in our world who don’t yet understand the gospel.

How about you? Are your ideas about salvation based on biblical truth?
Think about the importance of what Jesus did for you. “Believe on the
Lord Jesus Christ” (Acts 16:31). There is so much more at stake than
getting a free gift for answering a question.

Reflect & Pray

A Matter Of Faith Jesus paid the penalty for your sins by His death.
When you admit you are a sinner and place your faith in Him alone for
forgiveness, you will be reconciled to God.

Believing Christ died—that’s history; believing Christ died for
me—that’s salvation.
