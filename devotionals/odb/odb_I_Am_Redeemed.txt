I Am Redeemed!

Sing to the Lord, bless His name; proclaim the good news of His
salvation from day to day. —
Psalm 96:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 40:8-10

One day when Ann was visiting her husband in the hospital, she began
talking with a caregiver who was assisting him. Ann enjoys engaging
people in conversation wherever she is, and she also looks for ways to
talk to people about Jesus. Ann asked the caregiver if he knew what he
wanted to do in the future. When he said he wasn’t sure, she suggested
that it’s important to know God first so He can help with such
decisions. He then pulled up the sleeve of his shirt to reveal “I am
redeemed!” tattooed across his arm.

They realized that they shared a mutual love for the Lord Jesus
Christ! And both had found ways to show their faith in the One who
died to give us life.

The title of an old song by Steve Green says it best: “People need the
Lord.” It’s up to us to find ways to share “the good news” with them
(Ps. 40:9). Not everyone feels comfortable talking to strangers, and
there is no one-size-fits-all method. But God will use our
personalities and His light in us to spread His love.

“I am redeemed!” Let’s allow God to guide us to find ways to tell
others about Jesus Christ, our Redeemer!

Reflect & Pray

Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it! Redeemed by the blood of the
Lamb; Redeemed through His infinite mercy— His child, and forever I
am. —Crosby

The good news of the gospel is too good to keep to ourselves.
