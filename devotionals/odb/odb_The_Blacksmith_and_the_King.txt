The Blacksmith and the King

Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the
Lord, not for human masters.
Colossians 3:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 31:1-11

In 1878, when Scotsman Alexander Mackay arrived in what is now Uganda
to serve as a missionary, he first set up a blacksmith forge among a
tribe ruled by King Mutesa. Villagers gathered around this stranger
who worked with his hands, puzzled because everyone “knew” that work
was for women. At that time, men in Uganda never worked with their
hands. They raided other villages to capture slaves, selling them to
outsiders. Yet here was this foreign man at work forging farming
tools.

Mackay’s work ethic and life resulted in relationships with the
villagers and gained him an audience with the king. Mackay challenged
King Mutesa to end the slave trade, and he did.

In Scripture, we read of Bezalel and Oholiab, who were chosen and
gifted by God to work with their hands designing the tent of meeting
and all its furnishings for worship (Ex. 31:1-11). Like Mackay, they
honored and served God with their talent and labor.

We tend to categorize our work as either church work or secular. In
truth, there is no distinction. God designs each of us in ways that
make our contributions to the kingdom unique and meaningful. Even when
we have little choice in where or how we work, God calls us to know
Him more fully—and He will show us how to serve Him—right now.

Reflect & Pray

Father, grant me an awareness of my place in Your work. Help me to see
You at work in the people and places where I spend my time.

God will show us how to serve Him—wherever we are.
