A Poor Substitute

My people have changed their Glory for what does not profit. —
Jeremiah 2:11

Today's Scripture: Jeremiah 2:4-13

What happens when a person abandons his faith in God? Cases differ, to
be sure, but most faith-renouncers confess to sensing a void inside.
They have an emptiness that must be filled. Inevitably, they turn to a
God-substitute.

Almost anything can serve as a God-substitute—sports, art, sex, music,
work, gambling, drugs, alcohol, TV—even another person.

Joseph Goebbels scorned his religious upbringing that taught him about
Christ. He later remarked, “It is almost immaterial what we believe so
long as we believe in something.” For Goebbels that something was
really someone. None other than the murderous Adolf Hitler became
Goebbels’ God-substitute. When Hitler was finally trapped and
defeated, Goebbels killed himself and his family.

God spoke to the people of Judah through the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
“My people have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and [have
made] broken cisterns that can hold no water” (Jer. 2:13). They had
turned from the one true God to worthless God-substitutes.

To abandon God means we risk being made “desolate” (v.12). But
obedience to Christ brings complete fulfillment that gives life,
peace, and hope.
