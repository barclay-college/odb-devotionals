The Book Behind The Story

Your testimonies I have taken as a heritage forever, for they are the
rejoicing of my heart. —
Psalm 119:111

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 119:105-112

Millions of people around the world have seen Gone with the Wind,
which premiered in the United States on December 15, 1939. It won 10
Academy Awards and remains one of Hollywood’s most commercially
successful films. It was based on Margaret Mitchell’s 1936 novel,
which sold one million copies within 6 months, received a Pulitzer
Prize, and has been translated into more than 40 languages. An epic
movie often has its source in a powerful and timeless book.

The book that’s the basis for the Christian faith is the Bible. From
Genesis to Revelation, it is infused with God’s plan for His creation,
including us. Psalm 119 celebrates the power and necessity of God’s
Word in our lives. It lights our path (v.105), revives our souls
(v.107), and guards our steps (v.110). Through the Scriptures we find
wisdom, guidance, life, and joy. “Your testimonies I have taken as a
heritage forever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart” (v.111).

Jesus our Lord calls us to base our lives on His Word and share the
joy of knowing Him with people who are longing to find life. “I have
inclined my heart to perform Your statutes forever, to the very end”
(v.112).

What a book! What a Savior!
