Basin of Love

After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his
disciples’ feet.
John 13:5

Today's Scripture: John 13:1–17

One day in physics class many years ago, our teacher asked us to tell
him—without turning around—what color the back wall of the classroom
was. None of us could answer, for we hadn’t noticed.

Sometimes we miss or overlook the “stuff” of life simply because we
can’t take it all in. And sometimes we don’t see what’s been there all
along.

It was like that for me as I recently read again the account of Jesus
washing His disciples’ feet. The story is a familiar one, for it is
often read during Passion Week. That our Savior and King would stoop
to cleanse the feet of His disciples awes us. In Jesus’s day, even
Jewish servants were spared this task because it was seen as beneath
them. But what I hadn’t noticed before was that Jesus, who was both
man and God, washed the feet of Judas. Even though He knew Judas would
betray Him, as we see in John 13:11, Jesus still humbled Himself and
washed Judas’s feet.

Love poured out in a basin of water—love that He shared even with the
one who would betray Him. As we ponder the events of this week leading
up to the celebration of Jesus’s resurrection, may we too be given the
gift of humility so that we can extend Jesus’s love to our friends and
any enemies.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus Christ, fill my heart with love that I might roll up my
sleeves and wash the feet of others for Your glory.

Because of love, Jesus humbled Himself and washed His disciples’ feet.
