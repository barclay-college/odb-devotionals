On the Wing

So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
Matthew 10:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 10:27-31

In his book On the Wing, Alan Tennant chronicles his efforts to track
the migration of the peregrine falcon. Valued for their beauty,
swiftness, and power, these amazing birds of prey were favorite
hunting companions of emperors and nobility. Sadly, the wide use of
the pesticide DDT in the 1950s interfered with their reproductive
cycle and placed them on the endangered species list.

Interested in the recovery of this species, Tennant attached
transmitters to a select number of falcons to track their migration
patterns. But when he and his pilot flew their Cessna behind the
birds, they repeatedly lost signal from the transmitters. Despite
their advanced technology, they were not always able to track the
birds they wanted to help.

It’s good to know that the God who cares for us never loses track of
us. In fact, Jesus said that not even one sparrow “will fall to the
ground outside your Father’s care. . . . So don’t be afraid; you are
worth more than many sparrows” (Matt. 10:29-31).

When we face difficult circumstances, fear may cause us to wonder if
God is aware of our situation. Jesus’ teaching assures us that God
cares deeply and is in control. His tracking of our lives will never
fail.

Reflect & Pray

Father, I’m putting my longings and burdens on You at the end of this
year because I know You care for me and can work powerfully. Thank You
that I and my loved ones are in Your care.

If God cares for birds, will He not care for His children?
