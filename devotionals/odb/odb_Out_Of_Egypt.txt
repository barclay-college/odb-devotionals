Out Of Egypt

Take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt. —
Matthew 2:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 2:13-21

One year when our family was traveling through Ohio on the way to
Grandma’s house, we arrived in Columbus just as a tornado warning was
issued. Suddenly everything changed as we feared that our children
might be in danger.

I mention that story to help us imagine what it was like for Joseph’s
family as he, Mary, and their young child traveled to Egypt. Herod,
not a tornado, threatened them as he sought to kill their little boy.
Imagine how frightening it was for them, knowing that “Herod [sought]
the young Child to destroy Him” (Matt. 2:13).

We usually take a more idyllic view of Christmastime—lowing cattle and
kneeling shepherds in a peaceful scene. But there was no peace for
Jesus’ family as they sought to escape Herod’s horror. Only when an
angel told them it was safe did the family go out of Egypt and back
home to Nazareth (vv.20-23).

Consider the awe we should feel for the incarnation. Jesus, who
enjoyed the majesty of heaven in partnership with the Father, set it
all aside to be born in poverty, to face many dangers, and to be
crucified for us. Coming out of Egypt is one thing, but leaving heaven
for us—that’s the grand and amazing part of this story!

Reflect & Pray

Jesus our Savior left heaven above, Coming to earth as a Servant with
love; Laying aside all His glory He came, Bringing salvation through
faith in His name. —Hess

Jesus came to earth for us so we could go to heaven with Him.
