Seeing Upside Down

Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are
sick. —
Matthew 9:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 8:1-4; 9:9-12

In India I worshiped among leprosy patients. Most of the medical
advances in the treatment of leprosy came about as a result of
missionary doctors, who were willing to live among patients and risk
exposure to the dreaded disease. As a result, churches thrive in most
major leprosy centers. In Myanmar I visited homes for AIDS orphans,
where Christian volunteers try to replace parental affection the
disease has stolen away. The most rousing church services I have
attended took place in Chile and Peru, in the bowels of a federal
prison. Among the lowly, the wretched, the downtrodden—the rejected of
this world—God’s kingdom takes root.

Taking God’s assignment seriously means that we must learn to look at
the world upside down, as Jesus did. Instead of seeking out people
with resources who can do us favors, we look for people with few
resources. Instead of the strong, we find the weak; instead of the
healthy, the sick. Instead of the spiritual, the sinful. Is not this
how God reconciles the world to Himself? “It is not the healthy who
need a doctor, but the sick. . . . I have not come to call the
righteous, but sinners” (Matt. 9:12-13 niv).

To gain a new perspective, look at the world upside down as Jesus did.

Reflect & Pray

We know, Jesus, that You sought the lowly ones who were rejected by
others. We want to be like You. Open our eyes and show us how. We long
to be used by You to bless others.

Do you see a needy world through the eyes of Jesus?
