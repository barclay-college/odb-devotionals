When Beauty Never Ends

Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.
Psalm 63:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 27:1–4

I love looking at the Grand Canyon. Whenever I stand at the canyon rim
I see new brushstrokes of God’s handiwork that take my breath away.

Even though it’s just a (very large) “hole” in the ground, the Grand
Canyon causes me to reflect on heaven. A very honest twelve-year-old
asked me once, “Won’t heaven be boring? Don’t you think we’ll get
tired of praising God all the time?” But if a “hole in the ground” can
be so overwhelmingly beautiful we can’t stop looking at it, we
can only imagine the joy of one day seeing the very Source of
beauty—our loving Creator—in all of the pristine wonder of the new
creation.

David expressed this longing when he wrote, “One thing I ask from the
Lord, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord” (Ps.
27:4). There’s nothing more beautiful than the presence of God, which
draws near to us on this earth as we seek Him by faith, looking
forward to seeing Him face to face.

On that day we’ll never tire of praising our amazing Lord, because we
will never come to an end of fresh, new discoveries of His exquisite
goodness and the wonders of the works of His hands. Every moment in
His presence will bring a breathtaking revelation of His beauty and
His love.
