Wind And Fire

Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king. —
1 Peter 2:17

Today's Scripture: 1 Peter 2:9-17

Sometimes when I want to start a fire, the wind puts it out. But when
I try to keep a fire burning, wind keeps it going. So, in the first
situation, I label wind “bad” because it thwarts my plans; in the
other, I label it “good” because it helps me accomplish what I want to
get done.

This paradox illustrates how we judge things by the way they affect
us. We declare circumstances or people “bad” if they thwart our plans
or cause us inconvenience. We judge circumstances or people “good” if
we agree with them and they support our cause.

But God is the One who determines what is good or bad, and He does so
not by how it affects our plans but by whether or not it accomplishes
His. His plan is that we would be “a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
His own special people.” And His purpose for us is to “proclaim the
praises of Him who called [us] out of darkness into His marvelous
light” (1 Peter 2:9).

To accomplish God’s good purpose, we are to respect all people, love
other believers, fear God, and honor those who rule over us—even when
something doesn’t seem good to us (v.17). These kinds of actions may
fan a spark of belief in those who observe our responses to “bad”
circumstances and most of all bring praise to God.
