Grieving From A To Z

Though He causes grief, yet He will show compassion. —
Lamentations 3:32

Today's Scripture: Lamentations 3:25-33

Jerusalem was engulfed in flames, and the prophet Jeremiah wept. His
prediction of divine judgment had largely gone unheeded. Now his
terrible prophecy had come to pass with horrifying vividness. The
short book of Lamentations records the prophet’s grieving process over
the destruction of Jerusalem.

Jeremiah organized the book around the 22 letters of the Hebrew
alphabet, using a technique of alphabetic acrostics to aid the reader
in memorizing the passages more easily. But using this technique also
shows that he didn’t cut short his grieving process. He took
deliberate and intentional time to reflect upon and even to write down
his heartbreak. You might say he was learning to grieve from A to Z.

In the midst of his grief, the comfort of God surfaced. Reminders of
God’s sovereignty and goodness gave the prophet hope as he faced the
future: “The Lord will not cast off forever. Though He causes grief,
yet He will show compassion according to the multitude of His mercies”
(Lam. 3:31-32).

If you’ve recently experienced a painful loss, remember to take
adequate time to grieve and to reflect upon God’s goodness. Then you
will be able to experience His comfort and hope for the future.
