Kangaroos And Emus

Forgetting those things which are behind . . . I press toward the goal
for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. —
Philippians 3:13-14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 3:12-17

Two of Australia’s indigenous creatures, kangaroos and emus, have
something in common—they seldom move backward. Kangaroos, because of
the shape of their body and the length of their strong tail, can
bounce along with forward movement, but they cannot shift easily into
reverse. Emus can run fast on their strong legs, but the joints in
their knees seem to make backward movement difficult. Both animals
appear on Australia’s coat of arms as a symbol that the nation is to
be ever moving forward and making progress.

The apostle Paul called for a similar approach to the life of faith in
his letter to the Philippians: “Brethren, I do not count myself to
have apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which
are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I
press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in
Christ Jesus” (3:13-14).

While it is wise to learn from the past, we shouldn’t live in the
past. We cannot redo or undo the past, but by God’s grace we can press
forward and serve God faithfully today and in the future. The life of
faith is a journey forward as we become like Christ.

Reflect & Pray

I’m pressing on the upward way, New heights I’m gaining every day;
Still praying as I’m onward bound, “Lord, plant my feet on higher
ground.” —Oatman

I will go anywhere—provided it is forward.
