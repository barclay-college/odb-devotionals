The Two Bears

Where there is strife, there is pride, but wisdom is found in those
who take advice.
Proverbs 13:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 13:10-20

Some years ago, my wife, Carolyn, and I spent a few days camping on
the flanks of Mount Rainier in Washington State. When we were
returning to our campsite one evening, we saw in the middle of a
meadow two male bears boxing each other’s ears. We stopped to watch.

There was a hiker nearby, and I asked him what the conflict was about.
“A young female,” he said.

“Where is she?” I asked.

“Oh, she left about 20 minutes ago,” he chuckled. Thus, I gathered,
the conflict at this point was not about the female bear but about
being the toughest bear.

Most fights aren’t about policy and principle, or about right and
wrong; they’re almost always about pride. The wise man of Proverbs
swings his axe at the root of the problem when he writes: “Pride leads
to conflict” (13:10 nlt). Quarrels are fueled by pride, by needing to
be right, by wanting our way, or by defending our turf or our egos.

On the other side, wisdom resides with the well-advised—those who
listen and learn, those who allow themselves to be instructed. There
is wisdom in those who humble themselves—those who set aside their own
selfish ambition; who acknowledge the limits of their own
understanding; who listen to the other person’s point of view; who
allow their own ideas to be corrected. This is the wisdom from God
that spreads peace wherever it goes.

Reflect & Pray

Dear heavenly Father, help me as I battle pride today. It’s so easy to
take my eyes off You and focus on myself. Give me a humble heart.

Humility brings wisdom.
