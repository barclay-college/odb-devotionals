A Word For The Struggler

Do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. —
Hebrews 10:35

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 10:32-39

There is an old adage that says, “Don’t bite off more than you can
chew.” It’s wise not to take on more responsibilities than we can
handle. At some time, however, we will likely feel overwhelmed by the
size and difficulty of a task we have agreed to do.

This can happen even in our walk of faith in Christ when our
commitment to God seems too much to bear. But the Lord has an
encouraging word for us when our confidence wavers.

The writer of Hebrews urged his readers to recall the courage they
demonstrated during the early days of their faith (10:32-33). Despite
public insults and persecution, they aided believers in prison, and
they joyfully accepted the confiscation of their own property
(vv.33-34). With that in mind, he says, “Therefore, do not cast away
your confidence, which has great reward. For you have need of
endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may
receive the promise” (vv.35-36).

Our confidence is not in ourselves but in Jesus and His promise to
return at just the right time (v.37).

It is God’s power that enables us to continue in our journey of faith.
Recalling the Lord’s faithfulness in days past stirs our confidence in
Him today.
