Our Unseen Helpers

Are [angels] not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister? —
Hebrews 1:14

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 1:5-14

At one point in Martin Luther’s stormy career, he received some
discouraging news. But he responded by saying, “Recently I have been
looking up at the night sky, spangled and studded with stars, and I
found no pillars to hold them up. Yet they did not fall.” Luther was
encouraged as he reminded himself that the same unseen God who was
upholding the universe was caring for him.

There is another unseen source of help from which God’s children can
take courage when facing a physical or spiritual crisis—angels! Those
heavenly hosts are called “ministering spirits” (Hebrews 1:14), and
they are instantly responsive to God’s command. Little do we know what
powerful protection and help they provide. When Jesus was enduring
agony in Gethsemane, “an angel appeared to Him from heaven,
strengthening Him” (Luke 22:43).

But you say, “I’ve never seen an angel.” No need of that! It’s enough
to know that they do their quiet, protecting work beyond the realm of
physical sight. They call no attention to themselves, lest we focus on
them instead of Jesus. But their presence is real. Just knowing that
these unseen helpers are on our side strengthens our trust in God,
whom they faithfully serve.
