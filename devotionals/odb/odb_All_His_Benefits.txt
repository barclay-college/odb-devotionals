All His Benefits

Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits.
Psalm 103:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 103

A recurring difficulty on our journey of life is becoming so focused
on what we need at the moment that we forget what we already have. I
was reminded of that when our church choir sang a beautiful anthem
based on Psalm 103. “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His
benefits” (v. 2 nkjv). The Lord is our forgiver, healer, redeemer,
provider, satisfier, and renewer (vv. 4-5). How could we forget that?
And yet we often do when the events of daily life shift our attention
to pressing needs, recurring failures, and circumstances that seem out
of control.

The writer of this psalm calls us to remember, “The Lord is
compassionate and gracious . . . He does not treat us as our sins
deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the
heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear
him” (vv. 8,10-11).

In our walk of faith, we come to Jesus Christ humbled by our
unworthiness. There is no sense of entitlement as we receive His grace
and are overwhelmed by the lavishness of His love. They remind us of
all His benefits.

“Praise the Lord, my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name”
(v. 1).

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, we pause to consider all we have in You. Grant us
eyes to see Your provision and help us to remember every benefit You
have given to us.

Love was when God became a man.
