When Sharks Won’t Bite

One who is full loathes honey from the comb.
Proverbs 27:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 27:1–10

My children were thrilled, but I felt uneasy. During a vacation, we
visited an aquarium where people could pet small sharks kept in a
special tank. When I asked the attendant if the creatures ever snapped
at fingers, she explained that the sharks had recently been fed and
then given extra food. They wouldn’t bite because they weren’t hungry.

What I learned about shark petting makes sense according to a proverb:
“One who is full loathes honey from the comb, but to the hungry even
what is bitter tastes sweet” (Proverbs 27:7). Hunger—that sense of
inner emptiness—can weaken our discernment as we make decisions. It
convinces us that it’s okay to settle for anything that fills us up,
even if it causes us to take a bite out of someone.

God wants more for us than a life lived at the mercy of our appetites.
He wants us to be filled with Christ’s love so that everything we do
flows from the peace and stability He provides. The constant awareness
that we’re unconditionally loved gives us confidence. It enables us to
be selective as we consider the “sweet” things in life—achievements,
possessions, and relationships.

Only a relationship with Jesus gives true satisfaction. May we grasp
His incredible love for us so we can be “filled to the measure [with]
all the fullness of God” (Ephesians 3:19) for our sake—and the sake of
others.

Reflect & Pray

What are you most hungry for in life? Why does Jesus fulfill you in a
way that nothing else can?

Those who see Jesus as the Bread of Life will never be hungry.
