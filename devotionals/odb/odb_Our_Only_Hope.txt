Our Only Hope

We should live . . . godly in the present age, looking for the blessed
hope. —
Titus 2:12-13

Today's Scripture: 1 Thess. 4:13-18

An anonymous author wrote, “When I was first converted, and for some
years afterward, the second coming of Christ was a thrilling idea, a
blessed hope, a glorious promise, the theme of some of the most
inspiring songs of the church.

“Later it became an accepted tenet of faith, a cardinal doctrine, a
kind of invisible trademark of my ministry. It was the favorite arena
of my theological discussions, in the pulpit and in print. Now
suddenly the second coming means something more to me. Paul called it
‘the blessed hope.’ But today it appears as the only hope of the
world.”

From the human standpoint, there is no solution for the struggles of
the world. Leaders are naturally frustrated in trying to deal with the
increasing problems in society. The only complete and permanent
solution is found in the return of Christ to earth. When He comes, He
will set up His kingdom. He will rule the nations in righteousness,
and “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the
Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (Hab. 2:14).

As we await our Savior’s return, let us keep on praying, working, and
watching, while “looking for the blessed hope”—our only hope for this
world.

Reflect & Pray

And for the hope of His return, Dear Lord, Your name we praise; With
longing hearts we watch and wait For that great day of days! —Sherwood

As this world gets darker, the promised return of God’s Son gets
brighter.
