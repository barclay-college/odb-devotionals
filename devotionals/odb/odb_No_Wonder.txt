No Wonder!

We love Him because He first loved us. —nkjv
1 John 4:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Song of Solomon 1:1-4

“He’s perfect for you,” my friend told me. She was talking about a guy
she had just met. She described his kind eyes, his kind smile, and his
kind heart. When I met him I had to agree. Today he’s my husband, and
no wonder I love him!

In the Song of Solomon the bride describes her lover. His love is
better than wine and more fragrant than ointments. His name is sweeter
than anything in this world. So she concludes that it’s no wonder he
is loved.

But there is Someone far greater than any earthly loved one, Someone
whose love is also better than wine. His love satisfies our every
need. His “fragrance” is better than any perfume because when He gave
Himself for us, His sacrifice became a sweet-smelling aroma to God
(Eph. 5:2). Finally, His name is above every name (Phil. 2:9). No
wonder we love Him!

It is a privilege to love Jesus. It is the best experience in life! Do
we take the time to tell Him so? Do we express with words the beauty
of our Savior? If we show His beauty with our lives, others will say,
“No wonder you love Him!”
