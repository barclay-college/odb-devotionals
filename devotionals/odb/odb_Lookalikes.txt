Lookalikes

We all . . . are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing
glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
2 Corinthians 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 3:17–4:2

They say we all have one: Doppelgangers some call them. Lookalikes.
People unrelated to us who look very much like us.

Mine happens to be a star in the music field. When I attended one of
his concerts, I got a lot of double takes from fellow fans during
intermission. But alas, I am no James Taylor when it comes to singing
and strumming a guitar. We just happen to look alike.

Who do you look like? As you ponder that question, reflect on 2
Corinthians 3:18, where Paul tells us that we “are being transformed
into [the Lord’s] image.” As we seek to honor Jesus with our lives,
one of our goals is to take on His image. Of course, this doesn’t mean
we have to grow a beard and wear sandals—it means that the Holy Spirit
helps us demonstrate Christlike characteristics in how we live. For
example, in attitude (humility), in character (loving), and in
compassion (coming alongside the down and out), we are to look like
Jesus and imitate Him.

As we “contemplate the Lord’s glory,” by fixing our eyes on Jesus, we
can grow more and more like Him. What an amazing thing it would be if
people could observe us and say, “I see Jesus in you”!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help us to gaze on You, to study You, to know You. Transform us
into Your image by what we say, how we love others, and how we worship
You. May others see Jesus in us.

Love is the family resemblance the world should see in followers of
Christ.
