What Has God Done For Me Lately?

Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? —
Matthew 20:15

Today's Scripture: Matthew 20:1-16

I met a man who was absolutely convinced that God couldn’t forgive him
for the things he’d done. An older man took him under his wing, and a
year later, I was delighted that the younger man had not only accepted
Jesus as his Savior but was also consuming Scripture ravenously. Three
years later, though, when I talked with him, I noticed that his
enthusiasm had been replaced by grumbling: “I just don’t understand
how God can let evil people prosper while so many of His children
(including himself, he might have added) are struggling to make ends
meet.” The grumbling ate at the joy of his faith.

Like so many of us, he had forgotten how much he had needed Christ’s
grace. The gratitude he had felt when he first received the Lord was
now lost. This reminds us of the vineyard workers in Jesus’ parable
(Matt. 20:1-16). Their focus shifted to what was happening to and for
other people (vv.10-12).

While God owes us nothing, He freely gives us the salvation He
promises when we accept Christ. He then adds to His generosity by
sending His Spirit to help us in this life as we prepare for the joy
of eternity with Him. The seeming unfairness of life demands that we
keep our eyes on Him and His Word—not on others.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I admit that my focus at times gets drawn to others and what
they have. Forgive me and help me to stop grumbling. You are good to
me and provide what I need. Thank You. Amen.

All you need to know to be content is this: God is good.
