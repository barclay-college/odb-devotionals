What Love Is

God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still
sinners, Christ died for us. —
Romans 5:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:1-8

Years ago I asked a young man who was engaged to be married, “How do
you know that you love her?” It was a loaded question, intended to
help him look at his heart’s motives for the upcoming marriage. After
several thoughtful moments, he responded, “I know I love her because I
want to spend the rest of my life making her happy.”

We discussed what that meant—and the price tag attached to the
selflessness of constantly seeking the best for the other person,
rather than putting ourselves first. Real love has a lot to do with
sacrifice.

That idea is in line with the wisdom of the Bible. In the Scriptures
there are several Greek words for love but the highest form is agape
love—love that is defined and driven by self-sacrifice. Nowhere is
this more true than in the love our heavenly Father has shown us in
Christ. We are deeply valued by Him. Paul stated, “God demonstrates
His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ
died for us” (Rom. 5:8).

If sacrifice is the true measure of love, there could be no more
precious gift than Jesus: “For God loved the world so much that he
gave his one and only Son” (John 3:16 nlt).

Reflect & Pray

Amazing love! How can it be That Thou, my God, Shouldst die for me?
—Wesley

The measure of love is what you are willing to give up for it.
