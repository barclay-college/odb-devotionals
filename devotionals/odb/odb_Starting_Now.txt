Starting Now

Love each other deeply.
1 Peter 4:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 4:7–11

When my oldest sister’s biopsy revealed cancer in late February 2017,
I remarked to friends, “I need to spend as much time with Carolyn as
possible—starting now.” Some told me my feelings were an overreaction
to the news. But she died within ten months. And even though I had
spent hours with her, when we love someone there’s never enough time
for our hearts to love enough.

The apostle Peter called Jesus’s followers in the early church to
“love each other deeply” (1 Peter 4:8). They were suffering under
persecution and needed the love of their brothers and sisters in their
Christian community more than ever. Because God had poured His own
love into their hearts, they would then want to love others in return.
Their love would be expressed through praying, offering gracious
hospitality, and gentle and truthful conversation—all in the strength
God provided (vv. 9–11). Through His grace, God had gifted them to
sacrificially serve each other for His good purposes. So that “in all
things God may be praised through Jesus Christ” (v. 11). This is God’s
powerful plan that accomplishes His will through us.

We need others and they need us. Let’s use whatever time or resources
we have received from God to love—starting now.

Reflect & Pray

How have others loved you well? What have you received from God that
you might use to serve someone today?

There is nothing small in the service of God. Francis de Sales
