Truly Amazing

Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
should be called children of God! —
1 John 3:1

Today's Scripture: Romans 5:6-11

I read these words on a young woman’s personal Web site: “I just want
to be loved—and he has to be amazing!”

Isn’t that what we all want—to be loved, to feel cared for by someone?
And so much the better if he or she is amazing!

The one who fits that description most fully is Jesus Christ. In a
display of unprecedented love, He left His Father in heaven and came
to earth as the baby we celebrate at Christmas (Luke 2). Then, after
living a perfect life, He gave His life as an offering to God on the
cross in our behalf (John 19:17-30). He took our place because we
needed to be rescued from our sin and its death penalty. “While we
were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8). Then 3 days later,
the Father raised Jesus to life again (Matt. 28:1-8).

When we repent and receive Jesus’ gift of amazing love, He becomes our
Savior (John 1:12; Rom. 5:9), Lord (John 13:14), Teacher (Matt. 23:8),
and Friend (John 15:14). “Behold what manner of love the Father has
bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!” (1 John
3:1).

Looking for someone to love you? Jesus loves us so much more than
anyone else possibly could. And He is truly amazing!

Reflect & Pray

Amazing thought! that God in flesh Would take my place and bear my
sin; That I, a guilty, death-doomed soul, Eternal life might win!
—Anon.

The wonder of it all—just to think that Jesus loves me.
