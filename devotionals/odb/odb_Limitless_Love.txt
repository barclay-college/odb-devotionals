Limitless Love

Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches to
the clouds. —
Psalm 36:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 36

Recently, a friend sent me the history of a hymn that I often heard in
church when I was a boy:

Could we with ink the ocean fill,

And were the skies of parchment made,

Were every stalk on earth a quill,

And every man a scribe by trade;

To write the love of God above

Would drain the ocean dry;

Nor could the scroll contain the whole

Though stretched from sky to sky.

These words are part of an ancient Jewish poem and were once found on
the wall of a patient’s room in an insane asylum.

Also, Frederick M. Lehman was so moved by the poem that he desired to
expand on it. In 1917, while seated on a lemon box during his lunch
break from his job as a laborer, he added the words of the first two
stanzas and the chorus, completing the song “The Love of God.”

The psalmist describes the comforting assurance of God’s love in Psalm
36: “Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens” (v.5 esv).
Regardless of the circumstances of life—whether in a moment of sanity
in a mind otherwise muddled with confusion or during a dark time of
trial—God’s love is a beacon of hope, our ever-present, inexhaustible
source of strength and confidence.
