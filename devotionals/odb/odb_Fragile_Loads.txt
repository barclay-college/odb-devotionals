Fragile Loads

Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as
God in Christ forgave you. —
Ephesians 4:32

Today's Scripture: Colossians 3:12-17

As Dolores was driving along a country road, she noticed that a car
was following her rather closely. She could almost feel the irritation
of the driver as she drove cautiously and slowly navigated several
turns.

Of course, the driver of the other car had no way to know that Dolores
was transporting 100 pounds of mashed potatoes, two crockpots full of
gravy, and many other food items for a church supper—enough to feed
200 people! Sensing the other driver’s frustration, Dolores thought,
If he just realized the fragile load I’m carrying, he would understand
why I’m driving like I am.

Just as quickly, another thought occurred to her: How often am I
impatient with people when I have no idea of the fragile load they
might be carrying?

How easily do we pass judgment on someone, assuming that we know all
the facts about a situation? God’s Word sends us in a more charitable
direction, instructing us to treat each other with kindness, humility,
and patience (Col. 3:12). How much more loving we are when we bear
with and forgive each other (v.13).

Let’s treat others as we would like to be treated (Luke 6:31),
remembering that we don’t always know the burden they may be carrying.

Reflect & Pray

Kindness is a loving guide That shows us how to live, A treasure
which, the more we spend, The more we have to give. —Anon.

If you are tempted to lose patience with another, stop and think how
patient God has been with you.
