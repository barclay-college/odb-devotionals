Filtered Light

It is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has
shone in our hearts. —
2 Corinthians 4:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 4:1-12

The painting A Trail of Light by Colorado Springs artist Bob Simpich
shows a grove of aspen trees with golden leaves lit by the autumn sun.
The topmost leaves are brilliantly illuminated while the ground
beneath the trees is a mixture of sunlight and shadows. The painter
said of this contrast, “I can’t resist the light filtered through to
the forest floor. It weaves a special magic.”

The apostle Paul wrote to the followers of Jesus in Corinth, “For it
is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone
in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Cor. 4:6). Paul goes on to describe
the reality of life in which “we are hard-pressed on every side, yet
not crushed; . . . perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not
forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed” (vv.8-9).

There are times when it seems that the light of God’s face is dimmed
because of our difficulty, sorrow, or loss. Yet, even in these dark
shadows, we can see evidence of His presence with us.

If we walk in filtered light today, may we discover anew that God’s
light—Jesus—is always shining in our hearts.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, shine the light of Your face on us that we may find our way to
Your salvation. Shine Your light into the darkness that envelops our
world that we may see who You are and show others the way to You.

In dark circumstances, God’s light is still shining in our hearts.
