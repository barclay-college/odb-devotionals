Praying For You Today

The Spirit himself intercedes for us . . . . [Christ Jesus] is also
interceding for us.
Romans 8:26

Today's Scripture: Romans 8:22–34

When we face a perplexing situation or a tough problem, we often ask
our brothers and sisters in Christ to pray for us. It’s a great
encouragement to know that others who care are holding us up to God in
prayer. But what if you don’t have close Christian friends? Perhaps
you live where the gospel of Christ is opposed. Who will pray for you?

Romans 8, one of the great, triumphant chapters of the Bible,
declares, “We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit
himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. . . . The Spirit
intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God” (Rom.
8:26–27). The Holy Spirit is praying for you today.

In addition, “Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to
life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us” (v.
34). The living Lord Jesus Christ is praying for you today.

Think of it! The Holy Spirit and the Lord Jesus Christ mention your
name and your needs to God the Father, who hears and acts on your
behalf.

No matter where you are or how confusing your situation, you do not
face life alone. The Spirit and the Son are praying for you today!
