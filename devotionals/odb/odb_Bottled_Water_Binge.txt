Bottled Water Binge

Through one Man’s righteous act the free gift came to all men. —
Romans 5:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 5:12-21

Here in the United States, we’ve been on a bottled water binge for a
number of years. Even though most people have a safe supply of water
that is free and readily available from faucets and drinking
fountains, they still purchase bottled water. Choosing to pay for
something that I can enjoy at no cost doesn’t make sense to me, but
some people believe that a product they pay for is superior to
anything they receive free.

This sometimes carries over into our spiritual lives. Some struggle to
accept that salvation is a gift. They want to do something to earn it.
The problem is, no one can afford it. The price of salvation is
perfection (Matt. 19:21), and Jesus is the only person who could pay
the price (Rom. 5:18). To anyone who thirsts, He promises to “give of
the fountain of the water of life freely” (Rev. 21:6).

Some people try to purchase the living water of salvation with good
deeds and charitable donations. Although these are forms of spiritual
service valued by God, they are not what God requires for the
forgiveness of our sin. Jesus already paid the price by dying in our
place, and He offers to quench our spiritual thirst when we drink
freely from God’s fountain that will never run dry.

Jesus is the Living Water— Just one drink will make you whole; Drawing
daily from that wellspring Brings refreshment to the soul. —D. DeHaan

Jesus is the only fountain who can satisfy the thirsty soul.
