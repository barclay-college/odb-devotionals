Navigational System

When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all
truth. —
John 16:13

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 30:15-22

Have you ever wondered how an airplane pilot knows how to get from
point A to point B? Most likely, he uses VOR, short for VHF Omni-
directional Radio Range, a navigational system invented in the early
1950s. It still guides many aircraft to their destination today. The
pilot sets the course of the aircraft on his dial. If the aircraft
drifts from that set course, the instrument shows the pilot that the
plane is deviating so he can correct it to align the aircraft to the
set course again.

The nation of Israel in Isaiah’s day badly needed a reliable VOR
system. And God wanted to be that for them. But despite God’s warning,
they decided to align with Egypt (Isa. 30:1-2). God graciously
promised that one day, however, He would be their navigator: “Your
ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, ‘This is the way, walk in
it.’ Whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the
left” (v.21).

Today, Christians have an internal navigational system. Jesus sent the
Holy Spirit, who lives in us to “guide [us] into all truth” (John
16:13). If you need direction as to where to set the course of your
life, don’t rely on your own way. Use God’s VOR system. He will surely
lead you in the right direction.

The Spirit is our navigational system.
