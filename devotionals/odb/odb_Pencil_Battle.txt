Pencil Battle

They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.
—
Judges 2:19

Today's Scripture: Judges 2:11-22

As I learned to write my letters, my first-grade teacher insisted that
I hold my pencil in a specific way. As she watched me, I held it the
way she wanted me to. But when she turned away, I obstinately reverted
the pencil to the way I found more comfortable.

I thought I was the secret winner in that battle of the wills, and I
still hold my pencil in my own peculiar way. Decades later, however, I
realize that my wise teacher knew that my stubborn habit would grow
into a bad writing practice that would result in my hand tiring more
quickly.

Children rarely understand what is good for them. They operate almost
entirely on what they want at the moment. Perhaps the “children of
Israel” were aptly named as generation after generation stubbornly
insisted on worshiping the gods of the nations around them rather than
the one true God. Their actions greatly angered the Lord because He
knew what was best, and He removed His blessing from them (Judg.
2:20-22).

Pastor Rick Warren says, “Obedience and stubbornness are two sides of
the same coin. Obedience brings joy, but our stubbornness makes us
miserable.”

If a rebellious spirit is keeping us from obeying God, it’s time for a
change of heart. Return to the Lord; He is gracious and merciful.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, You are loving and gracious, and eager to forgive
when we return to You. May we pursue you with our whole heart and not
cling to our stubborn tendency to want things our way.

First we make our habits; then our habits make us.
