Snug As A Bug In A Rug!

I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, O Lord, make
me dwell in safety. —
Psalm 4:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 91:9-16

When I was a child, my family lived in a house my father built in the
cedar breaks west of Duncanville, Texas. Our house had a small
kitchen-dinette area, two bedrooms, and a great room with a large
stone fireplace in which we burned 2-foot-long cedar logs. That
fireplace was the center of warmth in our home.

There were five people in our family: my father and mother, my sister,
my cousin, and me. Since we had only two bedrooms, I slept year-round
on a porch with canvas screens that rolled down to the floor. Summers
were delightful; winters were cold.

I remember dashing from the warmth of the living room onto the porch,
tiptoeing across the frost-covered plank floor in my bare feet,
leaping into bed and burrowing under a great mountain of blankets.
Then, when hail, sleet, or snow lashed our house and the wind howled
through the eaves like a pack of wolves, I snuggled down in sheltered
rest. “Snug as a bug in a rug,” my mother used to say. I doubt that
any child ever felt so warm and secure.

Now I know the greatest security of all: God Himself. I can “lie down
in peace, and sleep” (Ps. 4:8), knowing that He is my shelter from the
stinging storms of life. Enveloped in the warmth of His love, I’m snug
as a bug in a rug.

Leaning, leaning, Safe and secure from all alarms; Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms. —Hoffman

No one is more secure than those who are in God’s hands.
