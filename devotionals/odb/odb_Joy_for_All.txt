Joy for All

Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for
all the people.
Luke 2:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 2:8–14

On the final day of a Christian publishing conference in Singapore,
280 participants from 50 countries gathered in the outdoor plaza of a
hotel for a group photo. From the second-floor balcony, the
photographer took many shots from different angles before finally
saying, “We’re through.” A voice from the crowd shouted with relief,
“Well, joy to the world!” Immediately, someone replied by singing,
“The Lord is come.” Others began to join in. Soon the entire group was
singing the familiar carol in beautiful harmony. It was a moving
display of unity and joy that I will never forget.

In Luke’s account of the Christmas story, an angel announced the birth
of Jesus to a group of shepherds saying, “Do not be afraid. I bring
you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in
the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah,
the Lord” (Luke 2:10–11).

The joy was not for a few people, but for all. “For God so loved the
world that He gave His one and only Son” (John 3:16).

As we share the life-changing message of Jesus with others, we join
the worldwide chorus in proclaiming “the glories of His righteousness
and wonders of His love.”

“Joy to the world, the Lord is come!”

Reflect & Pray

Father, give us eyes to see people of all nations as recipients of
Your grace and joy.

The good news of Jesus’s birth is a source of joy for all people.
