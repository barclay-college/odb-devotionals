The Good Old Days

I remember the days of old. —
Psalm 143:5

Today's Scripture: Psalm 143:1-6

Sometimes our minds run back through the years and yearn for that
better time and place—the “good old days.”

But for some, the past harbors only bitter memories. Deep in the
night, they ponder their own failures, disillusionments, and
fantasies, and think of the cruel hand life has dealt them.

It’s better to remember the past as David did, by contemplating the
good that God has done, to “meditate on all [His] works; . . . muse on
the work of [His] hands” (Ps. 143:5). As we call to mind the
lovingkindness of the Lord, we can see His blessings through the
years. These are the memories that foster the highest good. They evoke
a deep longing for more of God and more of His tender care. They
transform the past into a place of familiarity and fellowship with our
Lord.

I heard a story about an elderly woman who would sit in silence for
hours in her rocking chair, hands folded in her lap, eyes gazing off
into the far distance. One day her daughter asked, “Mother, what do
you think about when you sit there so quietly?” Her mother replied
softly with a twinkle in her eye, “That’s just between Jesus and me.”

I pray that our memories and meditations would draw us into His
presence.
