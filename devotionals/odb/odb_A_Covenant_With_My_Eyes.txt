A Covenant With My Eyes

I have made a covenant with my eyes. —
Job 31:1

Today's Scripture: Job 31:1-4

Our friend is a computer “techie.” One night when our family was at
his house, I noticed a verse taped to his monitor: “I have made a
covenant with my eyes” (Job 31:1). Evidently, he understood the
potential danger of spending hours alone in front of a computer with
easy access to indecent images.

Our friend’s “reminder verse” is a quote from Job, and it continues,
“Why then should I look upon a young woman?” Like many of us, Job had
promised himself to stay free of lust. Reflecting on that oath, he
said, “Does [God] not see my ways, and count all my steps?” (v.4). The
Bible assures us that God does (Heb. 4:13), and that we are
accountable to Him. This is why believers must “abstain from sexual
immorality” (1 Thess. 4:3). While some want to debate the boundaries
of morality, the Bible says, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her
has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matt. 5:28).

If you have made a covenant with your eyes, consider how Scripture
might help you keep this pledge. Post a verse on your computer screen,
television, or the dashboard of your car, and remember, “God did not
call us to uncleanness” but to holiness (1 Thess. 4:7).
