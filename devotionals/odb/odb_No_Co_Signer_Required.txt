No Co-Signer Required

People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms
what is said.
Hebrews 6:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 6:13–20

When a person without a long history of paying his or her bills on
time wants to obtain a loan to purchase a home or car, lenders are
often reluctant to take the financial risk. Without a track record,
that person’s promise to repay what he borrows is insufficient for the
bank. The would-be borrower usually resorts to finding someone who
does have a history of making good on their debts, asking them to put
their name on the loan too. The co-signer’s promise assures the lender
the loan will be repaid.

When someone makes a promise to us—whether for financial, marital, or
other reasons—we expect them to keep it. We want to know that God will
keep His promises too. When He promised Abraham that He would bless
him and give him “many descendants” (Hebrews 6:14; see Genesis 22:17),
Abraham took God at His word. As the Creator of all that exists, there
is no one greater than He; only God could guarantee His own promise.

Abraham had to wait for the birth of his son (Hebrews 6:15) (and never
saw how innumerable his offspring would grow to be), but God proved
faithful to His promise. When He promises to be with us always (13:5),
to hold us securely (John 10:29), and to comfort us (2 Corinthians
1:3–4), we too can trust Him to be true to His word.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for being so trustworthy. I need no other promises but
Your word. Help me to trust You more and more each day.

God’s promises are sure.
