Not My Worry

Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you.
Psalm 55:22

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 40:25-31

A man worried constantly about everything. Then one day his friends
heard him whistling happily and looking noticeably relaxed. “What
happened?” they asked him in astonishment.

He said, “I’m paying a man to do my worrying for me.”

“How much do you pay him?” they asked.

“Two thousand dollars a week,” he replied.

“Wow! How can you afford that?”

“I can’t,” he said, “but that’s his worry.”

While this humorous way to handle stress doesn’t work in real life, as
God’s children we can turn our worries over to Someone who has
everything perfectly under control even—especially—when we feel it is
not.

The prophet Isaiah reminds us that God brings out the stars and calls
them all by name (40:25-26). Because of “his great power and mighty
strength” not one of them is missing (v. 26). And just as God knows
the stars by name, He knows us individually and personally. We are
each under His watchful care (v. 27).

If we are inclined to worry, we can turn that worry over to the Lord.
He is never too weary or too tired to pay attention to us. He has all
wisdom and all power, and He loves to use it on our behalf. The Holy
One who directs the stars has His loving arms around us.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You know there are times when I get really scared. And I forget
that You have promised that You will never leave me to face difficulty
or loss alone. Help me to trust.

Worry ends where faith begins.
