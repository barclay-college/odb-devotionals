Lead Me to the Rock

I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher
than I.
Psalm 61:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 61

While shopping for a humidifier, I noticed an older woman walking back
and forth down the aisle. Wondering if she was shopping for
humidifiers also, I moved aside to allow her to draw near. Soon we
chatted about a flu virus in our area, one that left her with a
lingering cough and headache.

A few minutes later, she launched into a bitter tirade, expressing her
theory about the origin of the virus. I listened, unsure what to do.
She soon left the store, still angry and frustrated. Though she had
expressed her frustration, I couldn’t do anything to take away that
pain.

David, Israel’s second king, wrote psalms to express his anger and
frustration to God. But David knew that God not only listened, He
could also do something about his pain. In Psalm 61, he writes, “I
call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than
I” (v. 2). God was his “refuge” (v. 3)—the “rock” to which David ran.

When we’re in pain, or come in contact with someone in pain, David’s
example is a good one to follow. We can head to “the rock that is
higher” or lead someone there. I wish I had mentioned God to the woman
at the store. While God may not take away all our pain, we can rest in
the peace He provides and the assurance that He hears our cry.

Father God, make me mindful of those in need of a listening ear and
the hope of Your presence.

Rest on the Rock.
