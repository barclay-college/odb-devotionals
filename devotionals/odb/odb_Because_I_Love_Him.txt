Because I Love Him

“Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
Revelation 22:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 22:12–21

The day before my husband was to return home from a business trip my
son said, “Mom! I want Daddy to come home.” I asked him why, expecting
him to say something about the presents his daddy usually brings back
or that he missed playing ball with him. But with solemn seriousness
he answered, “I want him to come back because I love him!”

His answer made me think about our Lord and His promise to come back.
“I am coming soon,” Jesus says (Rev. 22:20). I long for His return,
but why do I want Him to come back? Is it because I will be in His
presence, away from sickness and death? Is it because I am tired of
living in a difficult world? Or is it because when you’ve loved Him so
much of your life, when He has shared your tears and your laughter,
when He has been more real than anybody else, you want to be with Him
forever?

I’m glad my son misses his daddy when he’s away. It would be terrible
if he didn’t care at all about his return or if he thought it would
interfere with his plans. How do we feel about our Lord’s return? Let
us long for that day passionately, and earnestly say, “Lord, come
back! We love You.”
