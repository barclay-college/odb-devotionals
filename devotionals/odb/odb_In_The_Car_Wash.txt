In The Car Wash

When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. —
Isaiah 43:2

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 43:1-13

I’ll never forget my first experience using an automatic car wash.
Approaching it with the dread of going to the dentist, I pushed the
money into the slot, nervously checked and rechecked my windows, eased
the car up to the line, and waited. Powers beyond my control began
moving my car forward as if on a conveyor belt. There I was, cocooned
inside, when a thunderous rush of water, soap, and brushes hit my car
from all directions. What if I get stuck in here or water crashes in?
I thought irrationally. Suddenly the waters ceased. After a blow-dry,
my car was propelled into the outside world again, clean and polished.

In the midst of all this, I remembered stormy times in my life when it
seemed I was on a conveyor belt, a victim of forces beyond my control.
“Car-wash experiences,” I now call them. I remembered that whenever I
passed through deep waters my Redeemer had been with me, sheltering me
against the rising tide (Isa. 43:2). When I came out on the other
side, which I always did, I was able to say with joy and confidence,
“He is a faithful God!”

Are you in the middle of a car-wash experience? Trust God to bring you
through to the other side. You’ll then be a shining testimony of His
keeping power.

How wonderful to know that He Who watches from above Will always keep
us sheltered in His ever-present love! —King

A tunnel of testing can produce a shining testimony.
