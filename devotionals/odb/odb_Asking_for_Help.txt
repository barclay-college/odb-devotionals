Asking for Help

“What do you want me to do for you?” Jesus asked him.
Mark 10:51

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 10:46–52

Her email arrived late in a long day. In truth, I didn’t open it. I
was working overtime to help a family member manage his serious
illness. I didn’t have time, therefore, for social distractions.

The next morning, however, when I clicked on my friend’s message, I
saw this question: “Can I help you in any way?” Feeling embarrassed, I
started to answer no. Then I took a deep breath to pause. I noticed
then that her question sounded familiar—if not divine.

That’s because Jesus asked it. Hearing a blind beggar call out to Him
on the Jericho Road, Jesus stopped to ask this man, named Bartimaeus,
a similar question. Can I help? Or as Jesus said: “What do you want me
to do for you?” (Mark 10:51).

The question is stunning. It shows the Healer, Jesus, longs to help
us. But first, we’re invited to admit needing Him—a humbling step. The
“professional” beggar Bartimaeus was needy, indeed—poor, alone, and
possibly hungry and downcast. But wanting a new life, he simply told
Jesus his most basic need. “Rabbi,” he said, “I want to see.”

For a blind man, it was an honest plea. Jesus healed him immediately.
My friend sought such honesty from me too. So I promised her I’d pray
to understand my basic need and, more important, I’d humbly tell her.
Do you know your basic need today? When a friend asks, tell it. Then
take your plea even higher. Tell God.
