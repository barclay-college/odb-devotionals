When God Says No

In perfect faithfulness you have done wonderful things, things planned
long ago.
Isaiah 25:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 25:1–5

When I was conscripted into the military at age eighteen, as all young
Singaporean men are, I prayed desperately for an easy posting. A clerk
or driver, perhaps. Not being particularly strong, I hoped to be
spared the rigors of combat training. But one evening as I read my
Bible, one verse leaped off the page: “My grace is sufficient for you
. . .” (2 Corinthians 12:9).

My heart dropped—but it shouldn’t have. God had answered my prayers.
Even if I received a difficult assignment, He would provide for me.

So I ended up as an armored infantryman, doing things I didn’t always
enjoy. Looking back now, I’m grateful God didn’t give me what I
wanted. The training and experience toughened me physically and
mentally and gave me confidence to enter adulthood.

In Isaiah 25:1–5, after prophesying Israel’s punishment and subsequent
deliverance from her enemies, the prophet praises God for His plans.
All these “wonderful things,” Isaiah notes, had been “planned long
ago” (v. 1), yet they included some arduous times.

It can be hard to hear God saying no, and even harder to understand
when we’re praying for something good—like someone’s deliverance from
a crisis. That’s when we need to hold on to the truth of God’s good
plans. We may not understand why, but we can keep trusting in His
love, goodness, and faithfulness.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give me the faith to keep trusting You even when You say no.

When God says no, He has a plan. Keep trusting Him!
