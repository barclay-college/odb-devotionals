Can I Trust You?

The Lord searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the
thoughts. —
1 Chronicles 28:9

Today's Scripture: Joshua 9:1-16

According to lie-detection experts, “Our natural tendency is to trust
people.” However, not everyone is trustworthy all the time. Signs that
someone may be lying include fidgeting, lack of eye contact, and
noticeable pauses in speaking. Even with these clues, experts warn
that it is still quite tough to tell deceivers from honest people.

Joshua needed to know if he could trust the Gibeonites. When they
discovered that God wanted him to get rid of some neighboring nations
(Josh. 9:24), they pretended to be from a faraway land. They arrived
in worn-out tunics and patched sandals, claiming, “Our garments and
our sandals have become old because of the very long journey” (v.13).
The Israelites were suspicious (v.7), but they “did not ask counsel of
the Lord” (v.14); and Joshua unwisely made a peace treaty with the
deceivers.

Many want to gain our trust: salespeople, financial advisors, or
estranged family members. If we wonder: “Can I trust you?” we
shouldn’t decide quickly, based only on what seems right to us. It’s
better to seek counsel from God’s Word (Ps. 119:105), godly people
(Prov. 11:14), and God Himself (James 1:5). Wisdom from above will
help us decide who to trust.
