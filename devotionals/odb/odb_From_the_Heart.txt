From the Heart

Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God,
for he is gracious and compassionate.
Joel 2:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Joel 2:12–17

In many cultures, loud weeping, wailing, and the tearing of clothing
are accepted ways of lamenting personal sorrow or a great national
calamity. For the people of Old Testament Israel, similar outward
actions expressed deep mourning and repentance for turning away from
the Lord.

An outward demonstration of repentance can be a powerful process when
it comes from our heart. But without a sincere inward response to God,
we may simply be going through the motions, even in our communities of
faith.

After a plague of locusts devastated the land of Judah, God, through
the prophet Joel, called the people to sincere repentance to avoid His
further judgment. “ ‘Even now,’ declares the Lord, ‘return to me with
all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning’ ” (Joel 2:12).

Then Joel called for a response from deep inside: “Rend your heart and
not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and
compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents
from sending calamity” (v. 13). True repentance comes from the heart.

The Lord longs for us to confess our sins to Him and receive His
forgiveness so we can love and serve Him with all our heart, soul,
mind, and strength.

Whatever you need to tell the Lord today, just say it—from the heart.
