A Portrait of Jesus

We have turned, every one, to his own way; and the Lord has laid on
Him the iniquity of us all.
Isaiah 53:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 53:4-12

In Portraits of Famous American Women, Robert Henkes writes, “A
portrait is not a photograph, nor is it a mirror image.” A portrait
goes beyond the outer appearance to probe the emotional depth of the
human soul. In a portrait, a true artist tries “to capture what the
person is really about.”

Over the centuries, many portraits have been painted of Jesus. Perhaps
you’ve seen them in a church or museum of art or even have one in your
home. Not one of these is a true portrait, of course, because we have
no photograph or mirror image of our Lord’s physical appearance. We
do, however, have a magnificent word portrait of Him in Isaiah 53.
This God-inspired description captures in vivid detail what He is all
about: “Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering . . . . But
he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our
iniquities; . . . and by his wounds we are healed” (vv. 4-5 niv).

This passage enables us to see love and sorrow, anguish and pain on
Jesus’ face. But His lips do not accuse or condemn. He has no sins of
His own to grieve; only ours to bear. And deep inside, He knows that
“He shall see the labor of His soul, and be satisfied” (v. 11).

What a portrait of our Savior!

Reflect & Pray

What amazing love You have for us, Jesus! As I think of how awesome
You are, I bow in silence before You.

Love was when God became a man.
