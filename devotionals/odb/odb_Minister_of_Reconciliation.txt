Minister of Reconciliation

While we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the
death of his Son.
Romans 5:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 5:16-21

As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached on a Sunday morning in 1957, he
fought the temptation to retaliate against a society steeped in
racism.

“How do you go about loving your enemies?” he asked the Dexter Avenue
Baptist congregation in Montgomery, Alabama. “Begin with yourself. . .
. When the opportunity presents itself for you to defeat your enemy,
that is the time which you must not do it.”

Quoting from the words of Jesus, King said: “Love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them
which despitefully use you . . . ; that ye may be the children of your
Father which is in heaven” (Matt. 5:44-45 kjv).

As we consider those who harm us, we are wise to remember our former
status as enemies of God (see Rom. 5:10). But “[God] reconciled us to
himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,”
wrote Paul (2 Cor. 5:18). Now we have a holy obligation. “He has
committed to us the message of reconciliation” (v. 19). We are to take
that message to the world.

Racial and political tensions are nothing new. But the business of the
church is never to feed divisiveness. We should not attack those
unlike us or those who hold different opinions or even those who seek
our destruction. Ours is a “ministry of reconciliation” that imitates
the selfless servant-heart of Jesus.
