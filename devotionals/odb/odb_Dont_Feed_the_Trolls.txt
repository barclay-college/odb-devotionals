Don’t Feed the Trolls

Make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always
full of grace.
Colossians 4:5–6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Proverbs 26:4–12

Ever heard the expression, “Don’t feed the trolls”? “Trolls” refers to
a new problem in today’s digital world—online users who repeatedly
post intentionally inflammatory and hurtful comments on news or social
media discussion boards. But ignoring such comments—not “feeding” the
trolls—makes it harder for them to derail a conversation.

Of course, it’s nothing new to encounter people who aren’t genuinely
interested in productive conversation. “Don’t feed the trolls” could
almost be a modern equivalent of Proverbs 26:4, which warns that
arguing with an arrogant, unreceptive person risks stooping to their
level.

And yet . . . even the most seemingly stubborn person is also a
priceless image-bearer of God. If we’re quick to dismiss others, we
may be the ones in danger of being arrogant and becoming unreceptive
to God’s grace (see Matthew 5:22).

That might, in part, explain why Proverbs 26:5 offers the exact
opposite guideline. Because it takes humble, prayerful dependence on
God to discern how best to show others love in each situation (see
Colossians 4:5–6). Sometimes we speak up; other times, it’s best to be
silent.

May we find peace in knowing that the same God who drew us near while
we were still in hardened opposition to Him (Romans 5:6) is powerfully
at work in each person’s heart.
