Me And Dad

The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend
and keep it. —
Genesis 2:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 9:35–10:1

A friend once spent a day installing large stone steps in his
backyard. When his 5-year-old daughter begged to help, he suggested
she just sing to encourage him in his work. She said no. She wanted to
help. Carefully, when it would not endanger her, he let her place her
hands on the rocks as he moved them.

He could have built the steps in less time without her. At the end of
the day, though, he not only had new steps but also a daughter
bursting with pride. “Me and Dad made steps,” she announced at dinner
that night.

From the beginning, God has relied on people to advance His work.
After equipping Adam to cultivate the land and supervise the animals,
God left the work of the garden in his hands (Gen. 2:15-20).

The pattern has continued. When God wanted a dwelling place on earth,
a tabernacle and temple did not descend from the sky; thousands of
artists and craftsmen worked to fashion them (Ex. 35–38; 1 Kings 6).
When Jesus proclaimed the new reign of God’s kingdom on earth, He
invited human beings to help. He told His disciples, “Pray the Lord of
the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest” (Matt. 9:38).

As a father does with his children, so does God welcome us as His
kingdom partners.
