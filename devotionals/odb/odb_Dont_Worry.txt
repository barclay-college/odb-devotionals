Don’t Worry!

Casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you. —
1 Peter 5:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 5:1-11

George Burns, American actor and humorist, said, “If you ask, ‘What is
the single most important key to longevity?’ I would have to say it is
avoiding worry, stress, and tension. And if you didn’t ask me, I’d
still have to say it.” Burns, who lived to be 100, enjoyed making
people laugh, and apparently followed his own advice.

But how can we keep from worrying when our lives are so uncertain, so
filled with problems and needs? The apostle Peter offered this
encouragement to the followers of Jesus who had been forcibly
scattered across Asia during the first century: “Humble yourselves
under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,
casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you” (1 Peter 5:6-7).

Peter’s instructions were not given to help us avoid suffering (v.9),
but so we can find peace and power to stand victorious against the
attacks of Satan (vv.8-10). Instead of being consumed by anxiety and
worry, we are set free to enjoy God’s love for us and express it to
each other.

Our goal should not be to see how many years we can live but instead
to live fully in loving service to the Lord for all the years we are
given.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I admit that I take things into my own hands and worry. That
weighs my spirit down and sometimes robs my nights of rest. Lift the
heaviness from my heart as I lean into You.

I will never think of anything that [God, my Father,] will forget, so
why should I worry? —Oswald Chambers
