Faith, Love, and Hope

We always thank God for all of you.
1 Thessalonians 1:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 1:1–3

For ten years, my Aunt Kathy cared for her father (my grandfather) in
her home. She cooked and cleaned for him when he was independent, and
then took on the role of nurse when his health declined.

Her service is one modern example of the words of Paul who wrote to
the Thessalonians that he thanked God for “your work produced by
faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by
hope in our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Thessalonians 1:3).

My aunt served in faith and love. Her daily, consistent care was the
result of her belief that God called her to this important work. Her
labor was borne out of love for God and her father.

She also endured in hope. My grandfather was a very kind man, but it
was difficult to watch him decline. She gave up time with family and
friends, and limited travel to care for him. She was able to endure
because of the hope that God would strengthen her each day, along with
the hope of heaven that awaited my grandfather.

Whether it is caring for a relative, helping a neighbor, or
volunteering your time, be encouraged as you do the work God has
called you to do. Your labor can be a powerful testimony of faith,
hope, and love.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, may I this day have eyes to see others’ needs, direction from
You on any ways I might help, and the Spirit’s power to obey. May I
live out the faith, love, and hope You’ve given to me.

The glory of life is to love, not to be loved; to give, not to get; to
serve, not to be served.
