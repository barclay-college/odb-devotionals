A Neighbor On The Fence

All who believed were together. —
Acts 2:44

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 2:41-47

The fence around the side yard of our home was showing some wear and
tear, and my husband, Carl, and I decided we needed to take it down
before it fell down. It was pretty easy to disassemble, so we removed
it quickly one afternoon. A few weeks later when Carl was raking the
yard, a woman who was walking her dog stopped to give her opinion:
“Your yard looks so much better without the fence. Besides, I don’t
believe in fences.” She explained that she liked “community” and no
barriers between people.

While there are some good reasons to have physical fences, isolating
us from our neighbors is not one of them. So I understood our
neighbor’s desire for the feeling of community. The church I attend
has community groups that meet once a week to build relationships and
to encourage one another in our journey with God. The early church
gathered together daily in the temple (Acts 2:44,46). They became one
in purpose and heart as they fellowshiped and prayed. If they
struggled, they would have companions to lift them up (see Eccl.
4:10).

Connection to a community of believers is vital in our Christian walk.
One way that God chooses to show His love to us is through
relationships.

Reflect & Pray

Blest be the tie that binds Our hearts in Christian love! The
fellowship of kindred minds Is like to that above. —Fawcett

We all need Christian fellowship to build us up and hold us up.
