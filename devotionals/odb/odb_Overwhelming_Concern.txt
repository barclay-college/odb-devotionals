Overwhelming Concern

A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. —
John 13:34

Today's Scripture: John 13:31-35

A while ago, I wrote an article about my wife, Marlene, and her
struggles with vertigo. When the article appeared, I was unprepared
for the tidal wave of response from readers offering encouragement,
help, suggestions and, mostly, concern for her well-being. These
messages came from all over the world, from people in all walks of
life. Expressions of loving concern for my wife poured in to the point
where we could not even begin to answer them all. It was overwhelming
in the best kind of way to see the body of Christ respond to Marlene’s
struggle. We were, and remain, deeply grateful.

At its core, this is how the body is supposed to work. Loving concern
for our brothers and sisters in Christ becomes the evidence that we
have experienced His love. While addressing the disciples at the Last
Supper, Jesus said, “A new commandment I give to you, that you love
one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By
this all will know that you are My disciples” (John 13:34-35).

Marlene and I experienced a sampling of Christlike love and concern in
those letters we received. With the help of our Savior and as a way of
praising Him, may we show others that kind of love as well.

Reflect & Pray

Bearing people’s heavy burdens, Shouldering their pain and grief,
Shows the love of Christ to others, Bringing them His sure relief.

The height of our love for God is indicated by the depth of our love
for one another. — Morley
