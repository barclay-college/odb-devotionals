Listening to God

The Lord God called . . . “Where are you?”
Genesis 3:9

Today's Scripture: Genesis 3:8–17

My young son loves to hear my voice, except when I call his name
loudly and sternly, followed by the question, “Where are you?” When I
do that, I am usually calling for him because he has been into some
mischief and is trying to hide from me. I want my son to listen to my
voice because I’m concerned about his well-being and do not want him
to get hurt.

Adam and Eve were used to hearing God’s voice in the garden. However,
after they disobeyed Him by eating the forbidden fruit, they hid from
Him when they heard Him calling, “Where are you?” (Gen. 3:9). They
didn’t want to face God because they knew they had done something
wrong—something He had told them not to do (v. 11).

When God called for Adam and Eve and found them in the garden, His
words did include correction and consequence (vv. 13–19). But God also
showed them kindness and gave them hope for mankind in the promise of
the Savior (v. 15).

God doesn’t have to look for us. He knows where we are and what we are
trying to hide. But as a loving Father, He wants to speak to our
hearts and bring us forgiveness and restoration. He longs for us to
hear His voice—and to listen.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for Your love and care. Thank You for sending Your
Son, our Savior, to fulfill Your promise of forgiveness and
restoration.

When God calls, we need to answer.
