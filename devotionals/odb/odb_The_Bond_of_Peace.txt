The Bond of Peace

Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of
peace.
Ephesians 4:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:1–6

After I confronted my friend by email over a matter on which we had
differed, she didn’t respond. Had I overstepped? I didn’t want to
worsen the situation by pestering her, but neither did I want to leave
things unresolved before she went on a trip overseas. As she popped
into my mind throughout the following days, I prayed for her, unsure
of the way forward. Then one morning I went for a walk in our local
park and saw her, pain etched on her face as she glimpsed me. “Thank
You, Lord, that I can talk to her,” I breathed as I approached her
with a welcoming smile. We talked openly and were able to resolve
matters.

Sometimes when hurt or silence intrudes on our relationships, mending
them seems out of our control. But as the apostle Paul says in his
letter to the church at Ephesus, we are called to work for peace and
unity through God’s Spirit, donning the garments of gentleness,
humility, and patience as we seek God’s healing in our relationships.
The Lord yearns for us to be united, and through His Spirit He can
bring His people together—even unexpectedly when we go walking in the
park.
