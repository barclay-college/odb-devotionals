His Presence

My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.
Exodus 33:14

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 3:7–12

The anxious father and his teenage son sat before the psychic. “How
far is your son traveling?” the psychic asked. “To the big city,” the
man replied, “and he will be gone for a long time.” Handing the father
a talisman (a kind of good-luck charm), he said, “This will protect
him wherever he goes.”

I was that boy. However, that psychic and that talisman could do
nothing for me. While in that city, I put my faith in Jesus. I threw
away the talisman and clung to Christ. Having Jesus in my life
guaranteed God’s presence.

Thirty years later, my father, now a believer, said to me as we rushed
my brother to the hospital, “Let us first pray; the Spirit of God goes
with you and will be with you all the way!” We had learned that God’s
presence and power is our only security.

Moses learned a similar lesson. He had a challenging task from God—to
lead the people out of bondage in Egypt and into the Promised Land
(Exodus 3:10). But God assured him, “I will be with you” (v. 12).

Our journey too is not without challenges, but we’re assured of God’s
presence. As Jesus told His disciples, “I am with you always, to the
very end of the age” (Matthew 28:20).

Reflect & Pray

When the journey seems long and dreary, dear Lord, help me to remember
that You are traveling with me.

There’s no need to fear where you’re going when Jesus is going with
you.
