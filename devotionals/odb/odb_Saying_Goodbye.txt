Saying Goodbye

No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service
in the kingdom of God.
Luke 9:62

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 9:57-62

Saying goodbye is hard—to family and friends, to a favorite and
familiar place, to an occupation or livelihood.

In Luke 9:57-62 our Lord describes the cost of being His disciple. A
would-be follower says to Jesus, “I will follow you, Lord; but first
let me go back and say goodbye to my family.” Jesus responds, “No one
who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the
kingdom of God” (vv. 61-62). Is He asking His followers to say goodbye
to everything and every relationship considered precious?

In the Chinese language there is no direct equivalent of the English
word goodbye. The two Chinese characters used to translate this word
really mean “see you again.” Becoming a disciple of Christ may
sometimes mean others will reject us, but it does not mean we say
goodbye to people in the sense that we are to forget all our past
relationships. Saying goodbye means that God wants us to follow Him on
His terms—wholeheartedly. Then we will see people again from the right
perspective.

God wants the best for us, but we must allow Him to take priority over
everything else.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, I want to follow You wholeheartedly. Help me not to place
anything or anyone before You.

When we follow Jesus we get a new perspective.
