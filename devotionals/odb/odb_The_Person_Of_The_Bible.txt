The Person Of The Bible

You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal
life; and these are they which testify of Me. —
John 5:39

Today's Scripture: John 5:31-40

During a church leaders’ conference at Seattle Pacific University,
noted pastor Earl Palmer recalled an experience that shaped his
teaching and preaching for half a century.

As a seminary student, he led a Bible study where he encouraged the
participants to consider the words of Scripture. “I became convinced,”
Palmer said, “that if I could get someone to look at the text, sooner
or later the text would win their respect, and it would always point
them to its living center: Jesus Christ. And when Jesus Christ has
your respect, that’s not very many inches away from faith.”

Jesus told a group of religious leaders, who were well acquainted with
the Old Testament but violently opposed to Him, “You search the
Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are
they which testify of Me. But you are not willing to come to Me that
you may have life” (John 5:39-40).

It requires an open heart as well as an inquiring mind to study the
Bible. When we discover Jesus as the Person to whom the entire Bible
points, we must then decide how to respond to Him.

There is great joy for all who will open their hearts to Christ and
find life in Him.
