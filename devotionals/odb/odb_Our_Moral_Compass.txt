Our Moral Compass

If My people . . . turn from their wicked ways, then I will . . .
forgive their sin and heal their land. —
2 Chronicles 7:14

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 7:1-14

When Abraham Lincoln was introduced to author Harriet Beecher Stowe,
he reportedly said that she was “the little woman who wrote the book
that started this great war.”

Although President Lincoln’s comment wasn’t entirely serious, Stowe’s
novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin was instrumental in abolishing slavery in the
US. Its graphic depiction of racism and the injustice of slavery
helped lead to the start of civil war. Ultimately, Lincoln’s
Emancipation Proclamation declared that all slaves “shall be free.”
Thus, Stowe’s novel helped to change a nation’s moral compass.

Centuries earlier, King Solomon was told about what would change the
moral compass of God’s people Israel. It was to start with humility
and confession. The Lord told Solomon: “If My people who are called by
My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn
from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive
their sin and heal their land” (2 Chron. 7:14).

As a Christian community, we should first take an inventory of our own
personal lives. As we humbly seek God in prayer and repentance of sin,
changes begin in our lives. God may then use us to change a nation’s
moral compass.
