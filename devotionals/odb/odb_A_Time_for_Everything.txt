A Time for Everything

There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under
the heavens.
Ecclesiastes 3:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 3:1–14

While flying recently, I watched a mother and her children a few rows
ahead of me. While the toddler played contentedly, the mother gazed
into the eyes of her newborn, smiling at him and stroking his cheek.
He stared back with a wide-eyed wonderment. I enjoyed the moment with
a touch of wistfulness, thinking of my own children at that age and
the season that has passed me by.

I reflected, however, about King Solomon’s words in the book of
Ecclesiastes about “every activity under the heavens” (v. 1). He
addresses through a series of opposites how there is a “time for
everything” (v. 1): “a time to be born and a time to die, a time to
plant and a time to uproot” (v. 2). Perhaps King Solomon in these
verses despairs at what he sees as a meaningless cycle of life. But he
also acknowledges the role of God in each season, that our work is a
“gift of God” (v. 13) and that “everything God does will endure
forever” (v. 14).

We may remember times in our lives with longing, like me thinking of
my children as babies. We know, however, that the Lord promises to be
with us in every season of our life (Isa. 41:10). We can count on His
presence and find that our purpose is in walking with Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, You lead me through the seasons, and whether I’m laughing or
crying I know You are with me. May I reach out to someone with Your
love today.

God gives us the seasons of our lives.
