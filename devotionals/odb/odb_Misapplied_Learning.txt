Misapplied Learning

Romans 6:11

Today's Scripture: Romans 6:1-14

After a 4-year-old got into trouble at preschool, his mom asked him
what he had done wrong. He explained, “I was angry with a playmate.
But you told me that I should not hit anyone, so I asked my friend to
do it for me!”

Where does someone so young learn that? The Bible tells us he did not
have to be taught—he was born with it! It is part of the fallen nature
that all of us have at birth.

But the Christian does not have to respond according to his fallen
nature. Paul reminds us that “our old man was crucified with [Christ],
. . . that we should no longer be slaves of sin” (Rom. 6:6). We are “a
new creation” (2 Cor. 5:17) and have been set free and have become
“slaves of God” (Rom. 6:22).

Yet, as Christians we do still struggle with our flesh and its sinful
desires (Rom. 7:18-19). But now that “we are alive to God in Christ
Jesus our Lord,” we can respond in a God-honoring way (Rom. 6:11).

Instead of being like the young boy who tried to get revenge, we can
obey the instructions of Romans 6:13, “Do not present your members as
instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God .
. . as instruments of righteousness.”

Reflect & Pray

O help us, Lord, to heed Your Word, Its precepts to obey; And give us
strength to quench the urge To do things our own way. —Sper

We gain the victory when we give up sin’s pleasure in exchange for
Christ’s power.
