Age Is Not a Factor

If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.
1 Corinthians 12:26

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 12:12-26

After owning and working at his dental lab for 50 years, Dave Bowman
planned to retire and take it easy. Diabetes and heart surgery
confirmed his decision. But when he heard about a group of young
refugees from Sudan who needed help, he made a life-changing decision.
He agreed to sponsor five of them.

As Dave learned more about these young Sudanese men, he discovered
that they had never been to a doctor or a dentist. Then one day in
church someone mentioned the verse, “If one part suffers, every part
suffers with it” (1 Cor. 12:26). He couldn’t get the verse out of his
mind. Sudanese Christians were suffering because they needed medical
care, and Dave sensed that God was telling him to do something about
it. But what?

Despite his age and bad health, Dave began exploring the possibility
of building a medical center in Sudan. Little by little, God brought
together the people and the resources, and in 2008 Memorial Christian
Hospital opened its doors to patients. Since then, hundreds of sick
and injured people have been treated there.

Memorial Christian Hospital stands as a reminder that God cares when
people suffer. And often He works through people like us to share His
care—even when we think our work is done.
