Grace in Our Hearts

Let your speech always be with grace. —
Colossians 4:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:4-10

A few years ago, four-star General Peter Chiarelli (the No. 2 general
in the US Army at that time) was mistaken for a waiter by a senior
presidential advisor at a formal Washington dinner. As the general
stood behind her in his dress uniform, the senior advisor asked him to
get her a beverage. She then realized her mistake, and the general
graciously eased her embarrassment by cheerfully refilling her glass
and even inviting her to join his family sometime for dinner.

The word gracious comes from the word grace, and it can mean an act of
kindness or courtesy, like the general’s. But it has an even deeper
meaning to followers of Christ. We are recipients of the incredible
free and unmerited favor—grace—that God has provided through His Son,
Jesus (Eph. 2:8).

Because we have received grace, we are to show it in the way we treat
others—for example, in the way we speak to them: “The words of a wise
man’s mouth are gracious” (Eccl. 10:12). Grace in our hearts pours out
in our words and deeds (Col. 3:16-17).

Learning to extend the grace in our hearts toward others is a by-
product of the life of a Spirit-filled follower of Christ Jesus—the
greatest of grace-givers.

Reflect & Pray

Dear heavenly Father, help me today to season my words with grace. May
all that I say and do be gracious to others and pleasing to You, O
Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

God’s grace in the heart brings out good deeds in the life.
