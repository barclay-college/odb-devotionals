From A Distance

Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it. —
Genesis 28:16

Today's Scripture: Acts 17:22-31

A popular song from years ago titled “From a Distance” envisions a
world of harmony and peace. It says, “God is watching us from a
distance.” Indeed God is watching us, but not from a distance. He is
present, in the room with you, right in front of you, gazing at you
with unbounded love in His eyes.

I think of the example of Brother Lawrence, who spent long years
working in a kitchen washing pots and pans and repairing the sandals
of other monks. He wrote: “As often as I could, I placed myself as a
worshiper before Him, fixing my mind upon His holy presence.”

That is our task as well. But we forget and sometimes need reminders
of His presence. I have driven an old handmade nail into the shelf
over my desk to remind me that the crucified and resurrected Jesus is
always present. Our task is to remember to “set the Lord always before
[us]” (Ps. 16:8)—to know that He is with us to “the end of the age”
(Matt. 28:20) and that “He is not far from each one of us” (Acts
17:27).

Remembering may be as simple as calling to mind that the Lord has
promised to be with you all through the day and saying to Him, “Good
morning,” or “Thank You,” or “Help!” or “I love You.”

Reflect & Pray

So near, so very near to God— I cannot nearer be; Yet in the person of
His Son, I am as near as He. —Paget

No one can come so near that God is not nearer still.
