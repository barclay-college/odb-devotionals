Calling You

The Lord called yet again, “Samuel!” —
1 Samuel 3:6

Today's Scripture: 1 Samuel 3:1-10

A couple of co-workers and I had just gone through airport security
and were walking to our gate when I heard my name: “Paging Anne Cetas.
Paging Anne Cetas.” It’s not a common name, so we knew it had to be
mine. I assumed I had absent-mindedly left something at the check-in
point. I checked with an airline agent, who told me to pick up a red
phone, give my name, and ask why I was being paged. I searched for a
phone and called, but the operator said, “No, we didn’t page you.” I
said, “It was definitely my name.” He replied twice, “No, we did not
page you.” I never did find out why I had been called that day.

A young boy named Samuel heard his name being “paged” long ago (1 Sam.
3:4). The Scriptures say that he “did not yet know the Lord, nor was
the word of the Lord yet revealed to him” (v.7), so the temple priest
Eli had to help him understand who was calling him (vv.8-9). God then
revealed His plan for Samuel’s life.

The Lord has a plan for us as well, and He calls to our hearts: “Come
to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest” (Matt. 11:28). That’s His call to us to receive the gift of His
salvation, rest, and peace.

The Savior is calling us to come to Him.
