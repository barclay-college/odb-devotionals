Grain On The Mountaintop

There will be an abundance of grain in the earth, on the top of the
mountains. —
Psalm 72:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 72:12-20

I’ve been on a number of mountaintops in the US in my time, and I can
tell you that not much grows up there. The summits of mountains are
bare rock and lichen. That’s not where you would normally find an
abundance of grain.

But Solomon, who wrote Psalm 72, asked God for “an abundance of grain
. . . on the top of the mountains,” to characterize his reign as king.
If grain on the mountain is so unusual, what is Solomon suggesting?
That God’s power can produce results in even the most unpromising
soil?

Perhaps you think of yourself as a little person, with very little to
bring to the kingdom. Take courage: God can produce an abundant
harvest through you. This is one of the ironies of faith: God uses the
insignificant to accomplish the great. Not many of us are wise or
noble; most of us are anonymous and far from extraordinary. Yet all of
us can be used. And contrary to what we might think, it is because of
our weakness that we can be used by God (1 Cor. 1:27-29; 2 Cor.
12:10).

It’s possible to be too big or proud for God to use, but we can never
be too little. “Out of weakness” we are “made strong” (Heb. 11:34). By
God’s great power, we can do all that He has called us to do.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, You work through such common things— those of us with flaws and
weaknesses. We are in awe of Your power and humbled by Your choice of
us. Our hearts long to be faithful to You.

To experience God’s power, we must first admit that we are weak.
