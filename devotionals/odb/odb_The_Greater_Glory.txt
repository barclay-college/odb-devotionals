The Greater Glory

In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be
taken of the entire Roman world.
Luke 2:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 17:1–5, 20–24

Caesar Augustus is remembered as the first and greatest of the Roman
emperors. By political skill and military power he eliminated his
enemies, expanded the empire, and lifted Rome from the clutter of
rundown neighborhoods into a city of marble statues and temples.
Adoring Roman citizens referred to Augustus as the divine father and
savior of the human race. As his forty-year reign came to an end, his
official last words were, “I found Rome a city of clay but left it a
city of marble.” According to his wife, however, his last words were
actually, “Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit.”

What Augustus didn’t know is that he’d been given a supporting role in
a bigger story. In the shadow of his reign, the son of a carpenter was
born to reveal something far greater than any Roman military victory,
temple, stadium, or palace (Luke 2:1).

But who could have understood the glory Jesus prayed for on the night
His countrymen demanded His crucifixion by Roman executioners? (John
17:4–5). Who could have foreseen the hidden wonder of a sacrifice that
would be forever applauded in heaven and earth?

It’s quite a story. Our God found us chasing foolish dreams and
fighting among ourselves. He left us singing together about an old
rugged cross.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, please help us to see through and beyond the passing
glory of everything but Your love.

The glory we need is the glory of the cross.
