Believing In Advance

Surely I am coming quickly. —
Revelation 22:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Revelation 22:12-21

In a German prison camp in World War II, undiscovered by the guards,
some Americans built a homemade radio. One day news came that the
German high command had surrendered, ending the war. Because of a
communications breakdown, however, the guards did not yet know this.
As word spread among the prisoners, a loud celebration broke out. For
3 days, they sang, waved at guards, and shared jokes over meals. On
the fourth day, they awoke to find that all the Germans had fled.
Their waiting had come to an end.

A number of Bible stories center on waiting: Abraham waiting for a
child (Gen. 12–21). The Israelites waiting for deliverance from Egypt.
Prophets waiting for the fulfillment of their own predictions. The
disciples waiting for Jesus to act like the powerful Messiah they
anticipated. Jesus’ final words at the end of Revelation are “I am
coming quickly,” followed by an urgent, echoing prayer, “Amen. Even
so, come, Lord Jesus!” (22:20). For this, we still wait.

Here’s the question I ask myself: As we wait, why are we so often
fearful and anxious? We can, like the Allied prisoners, act on the
good news we say we believe. What is faith in God, after all, but
believing in advance what will only make sense in reverse?

Reflect & Pray

Faith looks beyond the shadow Of dread and doubt and fear And finds
the Savior waiting And always standing near. —French

Waiting tries our faith and so we wait in hope.
