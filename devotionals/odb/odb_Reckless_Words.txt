Reckless Words

When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate.
1 Peter 2:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 2:13-25

I had been driving for almost half an hour when my daughter suddenly
wailed from the backseat. When I asked, “What happened?” she said her
brother had grabbed her arm. He claimed he had grabbed her arm because
she had pinched him. She said she pinched him because he had said
something mean.

Unfortunately, this pattern, which is common between children, can
show up in adult relationships too. One person offends another, and
the hurt person shoots back a verbal blow. The original offender
retaliates with another insult. Before long, anger and cruel words
have damaged the relationship.

The Bible says that “the words of the reckless pierce like swords,”
and that “a harsh word stirs up anger” but “a gentle answer turns away
wrath” (Prov. 12:18; 15:1). And sometimes not answering at all is the
best way to deal with mean or cruel words or comments.

Before Jesus’ crucifixion, the religious authorities tried to provoke
Him with their words (Matt. 27:41-43). Yet, “When they hurled their
insults at him, he did not retaliate . . . . Instead, he entrusted
himself to him who judges justly” (1 Peter 2:23).

Jesus’ example and the Spirit’s help offer us a way to respond to
people who offend us. Trusting the Lord, we don’t need to use words as
weapons.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, please give me self-control through Your Holy Spirit when I
am tempted to retaliate with words.

A soft answer has often been the means of breaking a hard heart.
