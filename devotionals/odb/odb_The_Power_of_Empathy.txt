The Power of Empathy

Remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison.
Hebrews 13:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 2:14–18; 13:1–3

Put on the R70i Age Suit and you immediately feel forty years older as
you experience impaired vision, hearing loss, and reduced mobility.
The Age Suit was designed to help caregivers better understand their
patients. Wall Street Journal correspondent Geoffrey Fowler wore one
and wrote, “The unforgettable, and at times distressing, experience
shed light not just on aging, but also how virtual reality equipment
can teach empathy and shape our perceptions of the world around us.”

Empathy is the power to understand and share the feelings of another.
During a time of severe persecution against the followers of Jesus,
the writer of Hebrews urged fellow believers to “continue to remember
those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those
who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering” (13:3).

This is exactly what our Savior has done for us. Jesus was made like
us, “fully human in every way . . . that he might make atonement for
the sins of the people. Because he himself suffered when he was
tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted” (2:17–18).

Christ the Lord, who became like us, calls us to stand with others “as
if [we] were together with them” during their time of need.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, we marvel at Your willingness to share our flesh and blood
in order to purchase our salvation. Give us grace to stand with others
who are in need today.

Jesus calls us to stand with others as if we were in their place.
