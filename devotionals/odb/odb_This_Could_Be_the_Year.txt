This Could Be the Year

We who are still alive and are left will . . . meet the Lord in the
air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.
1 Thessalonians 4:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18

My dad was a pastor, and on the first Sunday of each new year he
preached about the return of Christ, often quoting from 1
Thessalonians 4. His point was always the same: “This could be the
year that Jesus will return. Are you ready to meet Him?” I’ll never
forget hearing that sermon at age 6, thinking, If that’s true, I’m not
sure I will be among those He’s coming for.

I felt certain that my parents would be going to heaven, and I wanted
to go too. So, when my dad came home after church, I asked how I could
be sure. He opened the Bible, read some verses to me, and talked to me
about my need for a Savior. It didn’t take much to convince me of my
sins. That day, my dad led me to Christ. I will be forever grateful to
him for planting these truths in my heart.

In an increasingly chaotic world, what a hopeful thought that this
could be the year Jesus returns. More comforting still is the
anticipation that all who trust Him for salvation will be gathered
together, relieved from this world’s suffering, sorrow, and fear. Best
of all, we’ll be with the Lord forever!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, keep me always mindful of Your inevitable return. Thanks for the
assurance that this world is not all we have but that a blessed
eternity awaits all who trust in You.
