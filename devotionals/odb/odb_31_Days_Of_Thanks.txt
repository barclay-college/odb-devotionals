31 Days Of Thanks

Oh, give thanks to the Lord of lords! —
Psalm 136:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 136:1-16,26

January, according to many US calendars, is National Thank You Month.
This, of course, is easily transferable everywhere, so perhaps it
should be Global Thank You Month.

In order to make the best use of this celebration of gratitude, let’s
begin by seeing what Scripture says about thankfulness.

One place to start is Psalm 136, which begins and ends with the words,
“Oh, give thanks” (vv.1,26). Again and again in this chapter we are
reminded of a single, overriding reason to bestow our gratitude on our
great God: “His mercy endures forever.” We could spend the whole month
learning about gratitude from Psalm 136.

The psalmist reminds us of God’s “great wonders” (v.4). He tells us of
God’s creative work brought on by His wisdom (v.5). He moves on to
rehearse the great exodus of His people (vv.10-22). As we think
through these pictures of creation and deliverance found in Psalm 136,
we can easily find something to thank God for every day of this Thank
You Month.

What better way to start off a new year than to concentrate on
conveying gratitude to our Lord! “Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He
is good! For His mercy endures forever” (v.1).

Reflect & Pray

How good it is to thank the Lord, And praise to Thee, Most High,
accord, To show Thy love with morning light, And tell Thy faithfulness
each night! — Psalter

When you think of all that’s good, give thanks to God.
