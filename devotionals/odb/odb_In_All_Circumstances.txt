In All Circumstances

Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in
Christ Jesus.
1 Thessalonians 5:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Thessalonians 5:16–18

In our suburb we complain about the constant power outages. They can
hit three times in a week and last up to twenty-four hours, plunging
the neighborhood into darkness. The inconvenience is hard to bear when
we cannot use basic household appliances.

Our Christian neighbor often asks, “Is this also something to thank
God for?” She is referring to 1 Thessalonians 5:18:  “Give thanks in
all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” We
always say, “Yes, of course, we thank God in all things.” But the
half-hearted manner in which we say it is contradicted by our
grumbling every time the power goes off.

One day, however, our belief in thanking God in all circumstances took
on new meaning. I returned from work to find our neighbor visibly
shaken as she cried, “Thank Jesus the power was off. My house would
have burned down, and my family and I would have perished!”

A refuse-collection truck had hit the electricity pole in front of her
house and brought down the high-tension cables right over several
houses. Had there been power in the cables, fatalities would have been
likely.

The difficult circumstances we face can make it hard to say, “Thanks,
Lord.” We can be thankful to our God who sees in every situation an
opportunity for us to trust Him—whether or not we see His purpose.

Reflect & Pray

Father, we honor You with our words, but so often our actions reveal
that our hearts don’t trust You. Help us to see You at work in every
circumstance, no matter how difficult.

By God’s grace we can be thankful in all things.
