Thank God For Music

When the trumpeters and singers were as one, . . . the glory of the
Lord filled the house of God. —
2 Chronicles 5:13-14

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 5:7-14

Music plays a big part in the Bible. From Genesis to Revelation, God
enlists musicians to work on His behalf. He uses music to call people
to worship and to send them to war, to soothe ragged emotions and to
ignite spiritual passion, to celebrate victories and to mourn losses.
Music is an all-occasion, all-inclusive art form. There are followers
and leaders, simple songs and complex songs, easy instruments and
difficult instruments, melodies and harmonies, fast rhythms and slow
rhythms, high notes and low notes.

Music is a wonderful metaphor for the church because everyone
participates by doing what he or she does best. We all sing or play
different notes at different times, but we all perform the same song.
The better we know our parts, and the better we follow the conductor,
the more beautiful the music.

One of the best uses for music is praise. When Solomon’s temple was
completed, the musicians praised and thanked God. As they did, “the
glory of the Lord filled the house of God” (2 Chron. 5:14).

We thank God for beautiful music, for it’s like a preview of heaven,
where the glory of God will dwell forever and where praise for Him
will never cease.
