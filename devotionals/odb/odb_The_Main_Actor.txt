The Main Actor

The Lord has done this.
Psalm 118:23

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 118:6–9, 21–25

I once heard about a student taking a class in preaching at a
prominent seminary. The student, a young man who was a bit full of
himself, delivered his sermon with eloquence and evident passion. He
sat down self-satisfied, and the professor paused a moment before
responding. “That was a powerful sermon,” he said. “It was well
organized and moving. The only problem is that God was not the subject
of a single one of your sentences.”

The professor highlighted a problem all of us struggle with at times:
We can talk as if we’re the primary actor (emphasizing what we do,
what we say) when in truth God is the primary actor in life. We often
profess that God is somehow generally “in charge,” but we act as if
all the outcomes depend on us.

The Scriptures insist that God is the true subject of our lives, the
true force. Even our necessary acts of faith are done “in the name of
the Lord ”—in the Lord’s power (Psalm 118:10–11). God enacts our
salvation. God rescues us. God tends to our needs. “The Lord has done
this” (v. 23).

So the pressure’s off. We don’t need to fret, compare, work with
compulsive energy, or feed our many anxieties. God is in charge. We
need only trust and follow His lead in obedience.

Reflect & Pray

When are you most tempted to think you’re the main actor of your life?
How has God invited you to let Him be the center of your life?

God, I’ve been paying lip service to You being in charge of my world.
It’s exhausting, and I want to stop doing that. Help me trust You.
