Fresh Fruit

The righteous . . . shall still bear fruit in old age. —
Psalm 92:12

Today's Scripture: Psalm 92

I love the old photographs that are often printed on the obituary page
of our local newspaper. A grinning young man in a military uniform and
words such as: 92 years old, fought for his country in WWII. Or the
young woman with sparkling eyes: 89 years young, grew up on a farm in
Kansas during the Depression. The unspoken message is: “I wasn’t
always old, you know.”

Too often, those who have had a long life feel sidelined when they
reach their later years. Psalm 92, however, reminds us that no matter
how old we are, we can have a fresh and fruitful life. Men and women
who have been “planted” in the rich soil of God’s vineyard will
continue to “bear fruit” and be “fresh and flourishing” (v.14). Jesus
promised that “he who abides in Me, and I in him,” will continue to
bear “much fruit” (John 15:5).

Yes, muscles may ache and joints may hurt, and life may slow down a
bit. But inwardly we can be “renewed day by day” (2 Cor. 4:16).

I recently saw a T-shirt on a beautiful white-haired woman that said:
“I’m not 80. I’m 18 with 62 years experience.” No matter how old we
get, we can still be young at heart—but with the benefit of a well-
lived lifetime of knowledge and wisdom.

Reflect & Pray

We can be young in heart and mind, To others we can yet be kind, Sing
songs of praise to God through tears, And grow in grace through all
our years. —Zimmerman

Faithfulness is God’s requirement; fruitfulness is His reward.
