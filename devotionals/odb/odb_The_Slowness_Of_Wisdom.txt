The Slowness Of Wisdom

Whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak. —
John 12:50

Today's Scripture: John 8:1-11

When the Pharisees came to Jesus with the woman caught in adultery and
asked Him what should be done with her, He knelt for a moment and
scribbled in the sand (John 8:6-11). We have no idea what He wrote.
But when they continued asking Him, Jesus responded in one short
sentence: “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at
her first” (v.7). His few words accomplished much in confronting the
Pharisees with their own sin, for they walked away one by one. Even
today those words resound around the world.

Jesus had such a closeness to and dependence on His Father that He
said of Himself, “Whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so
I speak” (12:50). Oh, that we had such a relationship with our Father
that we knew how to respond with His wisdom!

Perhaps it begins with obeying James’ challenge to be “swift to hear,
slow to speak” (1:19). This is not the slowness of ignorance,
emptiness, timidity, guilt, or shame. But the slowness of wisdom born
of dwelling quietly on the Lord and His thoughts.

We’re often told to stop and think before we speak. But I think we
should take it much further and live a life where we’re always
listening for God’s wisdom.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, grant that we may hear You speak; For truth within our hearts we
seek; For unto Christ we would be true And know what He Himself would
do. —D. De Haan

Listen to God before you speak for God.
