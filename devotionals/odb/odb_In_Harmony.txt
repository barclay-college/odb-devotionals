In Harmony

As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good
stewards of the manifold grace of God. —
1 Peter 4:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Peter 4:7-11

I love playing the 5-string banjo. But it has one drawback. The fifth
string will harmonize with only a limited number of simple chords.
When other musicians want to play more complicated music, the banjoist
has to adapt. He can lend marvelous melodic tones to a jam session
only by making the right adjustments.

Just as musicians adjust with their instruments, we as believers also
need to make adjustments with our spiritual gifts if we want to
harmonize with others to serve God. For instance, those who have the
gift of teaching must coordinate with those who have the gift of
organizing meetings and with those who make sure meeting rooms are set
up and cleaned. All of us have spiritual gifts, and we must work
together if God’s work is to get done.

The apostle Peter said, “As each one has received a gift, minister it
to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God”
(1 Peter 4:10). Stewardship requires cooperation. Think about your
spiritual gifts (Rom. 12; 1 Cor. 12; Eph. 4; 1 Peter 4). Now reflect
on how you can dovetail their use with the gifts of other believers.
When our talents are used in a complementary way, the result is
harmony and glory to God.

Reflect & Pray

Without a note we sing in tune, An anthem loud we bring, When
willingly we give our gifts Of labor to our King. —Branon

Keeping in tune with Christ keeps harmony in the church.
