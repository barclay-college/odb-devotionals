A Song To Remember

Ascribe greatness to our God. He is the Rock, His work is perfect. —
Deuteronomy 32:3-4

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 31:16-22

I was delighted when I received a free gift in the mail—a CD of
Scripture set to music. After listening to it several times, some of
the melodies took root in my mind. Before long, I could sing the words
to a couple of verses in the book of Psalms without the help of the
recording.

Music can help us recall words and ideas we might otherwise forget.
God knew that the Israelites would forget Him when they entered the
Promised Land (Deut. 31:20). They would forsake Him, turn to idols,
and trouble would follow (vv.16-18). Because of this, He asked Moses
to compose a song and teach it to the Israelites so they could
remember their past closeness with Him and the sin that hurt their
relationship (31:19-22). Perhaps most important, God wanted His nation
to recall His character: “[God] is the Rock, His work is perfect; for
all His ways are justice, a God of truth and without injustice;
righteous and upright is He” (32:4).

Consider what God might want you to remember about Him today. Is it
His power, His holiness, His love, or His faithfulness? Can you think
of a song that celebrates God’s character? Sing it in your heart to
the Lord (Eph. 5:19).

Reflect & Pray

Give me a spirit of praise, dear Lord, That I may adore Your name,
Sing praises from the depths of a grateful heart To the One who is
always the same. —Dawe

Remembering God’s goodness puts a song in your heart.
