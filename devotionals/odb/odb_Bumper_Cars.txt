Bumper Cars

Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up
to seven times? —
Matthew 18:21

Today's Scripture: Matthew 18:23-35

Life is a lot like “bumper cars” at an amusement park. You get in your
car, knowing that you will get hit . . . you just don’t know how hard.
And when you get hit, you step on the gas pedal, chase the one who has
hit you, and hope to bump that person harder than they have bumped
you.

That may be a fun strategy for bumper cars, but it’s a terrible
strategy for life. When you get bumped in life, bumping back only
escalates matters and in the end everyone suffers damage.

Jesus had a better strategy: Forgive those who have “bumped” us. Like
Peter, we may wonder how many times we have to forgive. When Peter
asked Jesus, “Up to seven times?” Jesus answered “Up to seventy times
seven” (Matt. 18:21-22). In other words, there are no limits to grace.
We should always extend a spirit of forgiveness. Why? In the story of
the forgiving master, Jesus explained that we forgive not because our
offenders deserve it but because we’ve been forgiven. He says, “I
forgave you . . . because you begged me. Should you not also have had
compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?”
(vv.32-33).

Since we are among those who’ve been forgiven much, let’s stop the
damage and share that blessing with others.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, remind us of how deeply we have offended You and how often You
have extended the grace of forgiveness to us. Teach us to forgive
others and to trust You to deal with those who sin against us.

Forgiveness is God’s grace in action through us.
