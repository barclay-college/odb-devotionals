Lambs May Wade

All Scripture . . . is profitable. —
2 Timothy 3:16

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 3:13-17

Author C. S. Lewis says that reli- gious concepts are like soups—some
are thick and some are clear. There are indeed “thick” concepts in the
Bible: mysteries, subtleties, and complexities that challenge the most
accomplished mind. For example, “[God] has mercy on whom He wills, and
whom He wills He hardens” (Rom. 9:18). And yet, in the same volume
there are thoughts that are crystal “clear”: simple, attainable, and
easily grasped. What could ever surpass the simplicity of the clear
affirmation in 1 John 4:16, “God is love”?

John Cameron, a 15th-century writer, suggests, “In the same meadow,
the ox may lick up grass, . . . the bird may pick up seeds, . . . and
a man finds a pearl; so in one and the same Scripture are varieties to
be found for all sorts of conditions. In them, the lamb may wade, and
the elephant swim, children may be fed with milk, and meat may be had
for stronger men.”

All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are found in God’s Book, the
Bible—ocean depths that can stir the most sophisticated mind, and
shallow areas that can be negotiated by any simple, honest soul.

Why hesitate? “All Scripture . . . is profitable” (2 Tim. 3:16). Jump
in!
