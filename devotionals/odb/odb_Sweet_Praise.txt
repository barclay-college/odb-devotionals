Sweet Praise

Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly . . . singing with grace in
your hearts to the Lord. —
Colossians 3:16

Today's Scripture: Colossians 3:12-17

Several years ago, my husband helped to lead a work crew of high
school students on a short-term missions trip to a Christian school in
an urban community. Unfortunately, Tom had broken his foot shortly
before the trip and was supervising the work from a wheelchair. He was
discouraged because he wasn’t able to get around as he had hoped.

While he was working on the ground floor, a few of the girls were
painting on the third floor. He could hear them singing praise
choruses in harmony as their voices echoed down the wide-open
staircases. Song after song ministered to him. “It was the most
beautiful sound I’d ever heard,” he told me later. “And it lifted my
spirits.”

Colossians 3 reminds us, “Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly
in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
Lord” (v.16). Not only were those teenage girls giving sweet praise to
God, they were ministering to a co-worker.

Whatever you’re doing today, cultivate an attitude of praise. Whether
it is through song or conversation, let your joy in the Lord
reverberate to others. You never know who you might encourage.
