Dangerous Shortcuts

[Jesus said,] “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
that proceeds from the mouth of God.” —
Matthew 4:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 4:1-10

During recent elections in my country, one struggling mom I know
exchanged her vote for a bag of diapers. We had discussed the benefits
of each candidate, so her choice disappointed me. “But what about your
convictions?” I asked. She remained silent. Six months after her
candidate won, taxes went even higher. Everything is now more
expensive than before . . . even diapers!

In countries around the world, political corruption is not new.
Spiritual corruption is not new either. Satan tried to lure Jesus into
“selling” His convictions (Matt. 4:1-10). The tempter came to Him when
He was tired and hungry. He offered Him immediate satisfaction, fresh
bread in seconds, a miraculous delivery, the kingdoms of the world and
their glory.

But Jesus knew better. He knew that shortcuts were dangerous enemies.
They may offer a road free from suffering, but in the end the pain
they carry is much worse than anything we can imagine. “It is
written,” Jesus said three times during His temptation (vv.4,7,10). He
held firm to what He knew was true from God and His Word.

When we are tempted, God can help us too. We can depend on Him and the
truth of His Word to help us avoid dangerous shortcuts.

Reflect & Pray

Help me not to take shortcuts to satisfaction, Lord. Help me to run to
You and Your Word for the strength to fight the enemy. I’m confident
that You will be there to help me.

God’s road is not easy, but it leads to eternal satisfaction.
