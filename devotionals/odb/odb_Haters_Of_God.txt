Haters Of God

God gave them over to a debased mind. —
Romans 1:28

Today's Scripture: 2 Timothy 2:23-26

Recently, I listened to an audiobook by a militant advocate for
atheism. As the author himself read his own work with spiteful sarcasm
and contempt, it made me wonder why he was so angry.

The Bible tells us that a rejection of God can actually lead to a more
hateful attitude toward Him: “Even as they did not like to retain God
in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind . . . [to
become] haters of God” (Rom. 1:28-30).

Turning one’s back on God does not lead to secular neutrality. Indeed,
recent militant atheists have shown their desire to remove any
reference to a Creator from culture.

When we hear about atheists trying to remove crosses or the Ten
Commandments from society, it’s easy to respond to their hatred of God
with our own hatred. But we’re exhorted to defend the truth with an
attitude of love, “in humility correcting those who are in opposition,
if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the
truth” (2 Tim. 2:25).

The next time you see the works or hear the words of a hater of God,
do an attitude check. Then ask God for a spirit of humility and pray
that the offender might come to the knowledge of the truth.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help us not respond in kind To those who hate and turn from You;
Instead, help us to love and pray That someday they’ll accept what’s
true. —Sper

Defend the truth with love.
