Not A Hitching Post

Ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you
will find rest for your souls. —
Jeremiah 6:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 6:13-20

You may have heard the saying, “The past is supposed to be a
guidepost, not a hitching post.” It’s easy to become tied to memories
of “the good old days” instead of using our experiences to find
direction for the road ahead. We are all susceptible to the paralyzing
effects of nostalgia—a longing for what used to be.

Jeremiah was a priest from a small town near Jerusalem when God called
him to be “a prophet to the nations” (Jer. 1:5). He was given the very
difficult job of pronouncing God’s judgment primarily on the people of
Judah, who had turned away from the Lord. Jeremiah made it clear that
he was delivering God’s message, not his own (7:1-2).

The Lord said, “Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths,
where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find rest for
your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it’” (6:16).

God urged His people to look back so they could move ahead. The
purpose of considering the ancient paths was to find “the good way”
marked by God’s faithfulness, His forgiveness, and His forward call.

God can teach us from our past that the best road is the one we walk
with Him.

Reflect & Pray

Though I know not what awaits me— What the future has in store, Yet I
know that God is faithful, For I’ve proved Him oft before. —Anon.

God’s guidance in the past gives courage for the future.
