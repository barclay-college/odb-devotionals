The Night No One Came

Do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. —
Matthew 6:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:1-7

One winter night composer Johann Sebastian Bach was scheduled to debut
a new composition. He arrived at the church expecting it to be full.
Instead, he learned that no one had come. Without missing a beat, Bach
told his musicians that they would still perform as planned. They took
their places, Bach raised his baton, and soon the empty church was
filled with magnificent music.

This story made me do some soul-searching. Would I write if God were
my only audience? How would my writing be different?

New writers are often advised to visualize one person they are writing
to as a way of staying focused. I do this when I write devotionals; I
try to keep readers in mind because I want to say something they will
want to read and that will help them on their spiritual journey.

I doubt that the “devotional writer” David, whose psalms we turn to
for comfort and encouragement, had “readers” in mind. The only
audience he had in mind was God.

Whether our “deeds,” mentioned in Matthew 6, are works of art or acts
of service, we should keep in mind that they’re really between us and
God. Whether or not anyone else sees does not matter. He is our
audience.

You I would serve! —Somerville

Serve for an audience of one.
