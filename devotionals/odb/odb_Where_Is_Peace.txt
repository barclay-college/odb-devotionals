Where Is Peace?

We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 5:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 8:8–15

“Do you still hope for peace?” a journalist asked Bob Dylan in 1984.

“There is not going to be any peace,” Dylan replied. His response drew
criticism, yet there’s no denying that peace remains ever elusive.

About 600 years before Christ, most prophets were predicting peace.
God’s prophet wasn’t one of them. Jeremiah reminded the people that
God had said, “Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my
people” (Jeremiah 7:23). Yet they repeatedly ignored the Lord and His
commands. Their false prophets said, “Peace, peace” (8:11), but
Jeremiah predicted disaster. Jerusalem fell in 586 bc .

Peace is rare. But amid Jeremiah’s book of dire prophecies we discover
a God who loves relentlessly. “I have loved you with an everlasting
love,” the Lord told His rebellious people. “I will build you up
again” (31:3–4).

God is a God of love and peace. Conflict comes because of our
rebellion against Him. Sin destroys the world’s peace and robs each of
us of inner peace. Jesus came to this planet to reconcile us to God
and give us that inner peace. “Since we have been justified
through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,”
wrote the apostle Paul (Romans 5:1). His words are among the most
hope-filled ever written.

Whether we live in a combat zone or dwell in a serene neighborhood
with nary a whisper of war, Christ invites us into His peace.
