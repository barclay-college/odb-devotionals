The Heart’s True Home

[God] has . . . set eternity in the human heart.
Ecclesiastes 3:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 3:10–11

We had a West Highland Terrier for a number of years. “Westies” are
tough little dogs, bred to tunnel into badger holes and engage the
“enemy” in its lair. Our Westie was many generations removed from her
origins, but she still retained that instinct, put into her through
years of breeding. On one occasion she became obsessed by some
“critter” under a rock in our backyard. Nothing could dissuade her.
She dug and dug until she tunneled several feet under the rock.

Now consider this question: Why do we as humans pursue, pursue,
pursue? Why must we climb unclimbed mountains, ski near-vertical
slopes? Run the most difficult and dangerous rapids, challenge the
forces of nature? Part of it is a desire for adventure and enjoyment,
but it’s much more. It’s an instinct for God that has been implanted
in us. We cannot not want to find God.

We don’t know that, of course. We only know that we long for
something. “You don’t know what it is you want,” Mark Twain said, “but
you want it so much you could almost die.”

God is our heart’s true home. As church father Augustine said in that
most famous quotation: “You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and our
hearts are restless until they rest in You.”

And what is the heart? A deep void within us that only God can fill.

Reflect & Pray

Help me, Lord, to recognize my deep longing for You. Then fill me with
the knowledge of You. Draw me near.

Beneath all our longings is a deep desire for God.
