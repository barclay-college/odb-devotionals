The Greatest Invitation

Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no
money, come, buy and eat!
Isaiah 55:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Isaiah 55:1–7

During a recent week, I received several invitations in the mail.
Those inviting me to attend “free” seminars on retirement, real
estate, and life insurance were immediately thrown away. But the
invitation to a gathering honoring a longtime friend caused me to
reply immediately, “Yes! I accept.” Invitation + Desire = Acceptance.

Isaiah 55:1 is one of the great invitations in the Bible. The Lord
said to His people who were in difficult circumstances, “Come, all you
who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come,
buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.”
This is God’s remarkable offer of inner nourishment, deep spiritual
satisfaction, and everlasting life (vv. 2–3).

Jesus’s invitation is repeated in the last chapter of the Bible: “The
Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come!’ And let the one who hears say,
‘Come!’ Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes
take the free gift of the water of life” (Rev. 22:17).

We often think of eternal life as beginning when we die. In reality,
it begins when we receive Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord.

God’s invitation to find eternal life in Him is the greatest
invitation of all! Invitation + Desire = Acceptance.

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, thank You for Your promise of mercy, pardon, and eternal
life. I acknowledge my failures and receive Jesus as my Savior today.

When we accept Jesus’s invitation to follow Him, our whole life
changes direction.
