Living In Retirement

For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. —
Philippians 1:21

Today's Scripture: Philippians 1:12-21

As our plane landed at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, applause
broke out among a group of airline employees. I thought this was a bit
unusual, until I was told that the pilot had just completed the last
flight of his career. He would retire the next day, and his colleagues
were expressing their happiness for him.

For many people, retirement means doing what they have always wanted
to do—fish, golf, travel. Others work hard to retire early so they can
enjoy the fruit of their labor while still young and healthy.

The Christian looks at retirement differently. An elderly friend who
loves the Lord put it this way: “Tonight, I will retire to my bed.
Tomorrow morning, should the Lord give me life to live, I will wake up
and serve Him.” He had Paul’s perspective: “To me, to live is Christ,
and to die is gain” (Philippians 1:21). Paul’s sole purpose was to
glorify Christ. Whatever came of suffering, inprisonment, or hardship
was another opportunity to further the gospel and live for Him.

There is always work to be done for the Lord. As long as we live,
Christ can work in and through us if we adopt Paul’s outlook on life
and death. For him, there was no retirement from serving the Lord.

Reflect & Pray

Growing old but not retiring, For the battle still is on; Going on
without relenting Till the final victory's won. —Anon.

Retirement from our jobs—yes. Retirement from serving Christ—never!
