Asking God First

Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your
heart.
Psalm 37:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 37:3–7, 23–24

Early in our marriage, I struggled to figure out my wife’s
preferences. Did she want a quiet dinner at home or a meal at a fancy
restaurant? Was it okay for me to hang out with the guys, or did she
expect me to keep the weekend free for her? Once, instead of guessing
and deciding first, I asked her, “What do you want?”

“I’m fine with either,” she replied with a warm smile. “I’m just happy
you thought of me.”

At times I’ve wanted desperately to know exactly what God wanted me to
do—such as which job to take. Praying for guidance and reading the
Bible didn’t reveal any specific answers. But one answer was clear: I
was to trust in the Lord, take delight in Him, and commit my way to
Him (Psalm 37:3–5).

That’s when I realized that God usually gives us the freedom of
choice—if we first seek to put His ways before our own. That means
dropping choices that are plainly wrong or would not please Him. It
might be something immoral, ungodly, or unhelpful toward our
relationship with Him. If the remaining options please God, then we’re
free to choose from them. Our loving Father wants to give us the
desires of our hearts—hearts that take delight in Him (v. 4).

Reflect & Pray

Teach me, O God, to put You first in everything I do. Show me how to
take delight in You, that my heart will be transformed to be like
Yours.

Do your decisions please God?
