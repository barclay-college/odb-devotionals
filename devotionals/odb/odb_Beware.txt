Beware!

You have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many
antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour. —
1 John 2:18

Today's Scripture: 1 John 2:18-27

When Secret Service agents train bank tellers to identify counterfeit
bills, they show them both fake money and real money, and they study
both. To detect a counterfeit problem, they must look for the
differences in the genuine bill compared to the counterfeit—and not
the similarities.

In 1 John 2, the apostle John helps to protect believers from heresy
by showing them examples of counterfeit Christians and teachers. One
of the signs of the last days is the coming of antichrists (1 John
2:18). Antichrists are those who claim to have His power and authority
but don’t, or those who reject and oppose Him and His teachings.

John gave three marks of false teachers who are controlled by the
spirit of the antichrists: They depart from the fellowship (v.19),
they deny Jesus as the Messiah (v.22), and they draw the faithful away
from Jesus (v.26). He encouraged believers to protect themselves
against the spirit of the antichrists by depending on the indwelling
presence of the Spirit, knowing the truth, and remaining in fellowship
with Jesus.

We can protect ourselves from error and deception by knowing the false
but relying on the Truth—Jesus Christ.
