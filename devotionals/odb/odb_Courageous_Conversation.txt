Courageous Conversation

When Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because
he was to be blamed. —
Galatians 2:11

Today's Scripture: Galatians 2:11-21

Is it possible that technological advances in communication have left
us unable to confront people properly? After all, employers can now
send layoff notices via e-mail. And people can criticize others on
Facebook and Twitter instead of talking face to face. Perhaps it might
be better to put all that aside and emulate how Paul communicated with
Peter when they had a disagreement.

Paul had to confront Peter for compromising grace (Gal. 2:11-16).
Peter had been fellowshiping with Gentiles, but when the Judaizers
arrived (who believed that sinners are saved through Jesus plus
keeping the law of Moses), Peter separated himself from the Gentiles.
He ostracized them while professing to be one with them. Seeing this
hypocrisy, Paul, in love and with passion, confronted Peter face to
face for cowering to a legalistic system that was powerless to change
lives. He vigorously reminded Peter that grace leads to freedom from
sin’s slavery and to obedience to God.

Having courageous conversations with fellow Christians can be
difficult, but they will promote purity and unity. We can carry out
our responsibility to one another to speak the truth in love (Eph.
4:15) by walking in the power of the Holy Spirit.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, give us courage to confront Believers who have strayed; And then
with gentleness restore By coming to their aid. —Sper

A well-chosen word can speak volumes.
