The View from the Mountain

Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on
things above.
Colossians 3:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:8-13

Our valley in Idaho can be very cold in the winter. Clouds and fog
roll in and blanket the ground, trapping frigid air under warmer
layers above. But you can get above the valley. There’s a road nearby
that winds up the flank of Shafer Butte, a 7,500-foot mountain that
rises out of our valley. A few minutes of driving and you break out of
the fog and emerge into the warmth and brilliance of a sunlit day. You
can look down on the clouds that shroud the valley below and see it
from a different point of view.

Life is like that at times. Circumstances seem to surround us with a
fog that sunlight cannot penetrate. Yet faith is the way we get above
the valley—the means by which we “set [our] hearts on things above”
(Col. 3:1). As we do, the Lord enables us to rise above our
circumstances and find courage and calmness for the day. As the
apostle Paul wrote, “I have learned to be content whatever the
circumstances” (Phil. 4:11).

We can climb out of our misery and gloom. We can sit for a time on
the mountainside and through Christ who gives us strength (v. 13) we
can gain a different perspective.
