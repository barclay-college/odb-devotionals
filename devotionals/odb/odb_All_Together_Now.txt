All Together Now

With one mind and one voice . . . glorify the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 15:6

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 15:1–7

While Andy was boarding a train in Perth, Australia, his leg became
wedged in the gap between the platform and a commuter car. When safety
officials could not free him, they coordinated the efforts of nearly
50 passengers who lined up and, on the count of three, pushed against
the train. Working in unison, they shifted the weight just enough to
free his leg.

The apostle Paul recognized the power of Christians working together
in many of his letters to the early churches. He urged the Roman
believers to accept each other the way Christ had accepted them and
said, “[May God] give you the same attitude of mind toward each other
that Christ Jesus had, so that with one mind and one voice you may
glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 15:5–6).

Unity with other believers enables us to broadcast God’s greatness and
also helps us to endure persecution. Knowing that the Philippians
would pay a price for their faith, Paul encouraged them to strive
“together as one for the faith of the gospel without being frightened
in any way by those who oppose you” (Phil. 1:27–28).

Satan loves to divide and conquer, but his efforts fail when, with
God’s help, we “make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit
through the bond of peace” (Eph. 4:3).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, please let Christians everywhere experience the blessing of
unity in You. Remind us of what we have in common: one hope, one
faith, and one Lord—Jesus Christ.

Our unity comes from our union with Christ.
