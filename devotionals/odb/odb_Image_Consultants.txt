Image Consultants

[You] have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to
the image of Him who created him. —
Colossians 3:10

Today's Scripture & Insight: Colossians 3:1-11

In our media-saturated age, image consultants have become
indispensable. Entertainers, athletes, politicians, and business
leaders seem desperate to manage the way they are perceived in the
eyes of the world. These high-priced consultants work to shape how
their clients are viewed—even if sometimes there is a stark contrast
between the public image and the real person inside.

In reality, what people need—what all of us need—is not an external
makeover but an inner transformation. Our deepest flaws cannot be
corrected cosmetically. They are directly related to who we are in
heart and mind, and they reveal how far we have fallen from the image
of God in which we were created. But such transformation is beyond any
human ability to accomplish.

Only Christ offers us true transformation—not just a facelift or an
outward adjustment. Paul said that those who have been raised to
eternal life in Christ “have put on the new man who is renewed in
knowledge according to the image of Him who created him” (Col. 3:10).

New! What a tremendous word full of hope! Christ transforms us into
new people in Him—people with a new heart, not just fixed up to look
good on the outside.

Reflect & Pray

If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed
away; behold, all things have become new. —2 Corinthians 5:17

The Spirit develops in us the clear image of Christ.
