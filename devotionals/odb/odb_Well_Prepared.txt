Well Prepared

You also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not
expect. —
Matthew 24:44

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 6:10-20

The idea of always being prepared makes me think of the man who lived
next door to us when I was growing up. When Mr. Nienhuis came home, he
never failed to back his car into the garage. That seemed unusual to
me until my mother explained that Nels was a volunteer fireman. If he
got a call, he had to be ready to race to the fire station. He backed
in so he could leave quickly when he had to report for duty.

To be well prepared is important in so much of life. “If I had 8 hours
to chop down a tree, I’d spend 6 sharpening my axe,” said Abraham
Lincoln. We prepare for a career by studying. We buy insurance in case
of a car accident or a house fire. We even prepare for the end of life
by making a will to provide for loved ones.

The Bible tells us we must prepare ourselves spiritually as well. We
do that by putting on spiritual armor to protect ourselves from
spiritual attack (Eph. 6:10-20); by preparing our minds for holy
living (1 Peter 1:13); by making sure we’re always prepared to answer
questions about the reason for the hope we possess (3:15); and by
ensuring that we are ready for the promised return of Jesus (Matt.
24:44).

How well prepared are you for what lies ahead? Unsure? Ask the Lord
for His help and guidance.
