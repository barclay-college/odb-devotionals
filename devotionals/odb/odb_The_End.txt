The End?

But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ. —
1 Corinthians 15:57

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 15:50-58

Everything in this world eventually comes to an end, which at times
can be disheartening. It’s the feeling you get when you read a book
that’s so good you don’t want it to end. Or when you watch a movie
that you wish would go on a little while longer.

But all things—good and bad—do come to “The End.” In fact, life
ultimately does come to the end—sometimes sooner than we expect. All
of us who have stood by the casket of a loved one know the painful
emptiness of a heart that wishes it wasn’t over yet.

Thankfully, Jesus steps into the fray of terminal disappointments,
and, through His death and resurrection, He interjects hope for us. In
Him “the end” is a prelude to a death-free eternity, and words like
“it’s over” are replaced by a joy-filled “forever.” Since our bodies
are not an eternal reality, Paul assures us that “we shall all be
changed” (1 Cor. 15:51) and reminds us that because of Christ’s
conquering work we can confidently say, “O Death, . . . where is your
victory?” (v.55).

So let not your heart be troubled. Our sorrow is real, but we can be
filled with gratitude because God “gives us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ” (v.57).

Reflect & Pray

Lord, keep our eyes and hearts fixed not on the temporary joys or
disappointments but on the victorious realities of eternity. Thank You
for Your death and resurrection that guarantee our forever future.

In Christ, the end is only the beginning.
