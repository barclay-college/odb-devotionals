A Prize For Peace

These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. —
John 16:33

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 2:11-18

Alfred Nobel made a fortune from the invention of dynamite, which
changed the course of warfare. Perhaps because of the horrors that
wars inflicted with the use of dynamite, he made a provision in his
will for a prize to be given annually to those who work to promote
peace. Today it’s called the Nobel Peace Prize.

God’s expression of peace to the world was His Son. When Jesus was
born, the angels’ clear, unmistakable message to the shepherds was “on
earth peace, goodwill toward men” (Luke 2:14).

The biblical definition of peace is, first of all, peace with God
(Rom. 5:1). Sin makes us enemies with God (v.10), but Jesus’ coming to
this earth and dying on the cross turned away God’s wrath. We can now
be reconciled with Him. Having put right our relationship with God,
Jesus now enables us to work at breaking down the barriers between us
and others.

Another kind of peace is having the peace of God (Phil. 4:7). There is
no need to be anxious about anything, for we are told that we can make
our requests known to Him.

Having brought peace, Jesus is now seated at the right hand of the
Father (Heb. 12:2). Today, we can have peace with God and the peace of
God.
