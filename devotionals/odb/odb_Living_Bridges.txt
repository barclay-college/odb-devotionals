Living Bridges

Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord. —
Jeremiah 17:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 17:5-10

People who live in Cherrapunji, India, have developed a unique way to
get across the many rivers and streams in their land. They grow
bridges from the roots of rubber trees. These “living bridges” take
between 10 to 15 years to mature, but once they are established, they
are extremely stable and last for hundreds of years.

The Bible compares a person who trusts in God to “a tree planted by
the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river” (Jer. 17:8).
Because its roots are well-nourished, this tree survives soaring
temperatures. And during drought it continues to yield fruit.

Like a firmly rooted tree, people who rely on God have a sense of
stability and vitality despite the worst circumstances. In contrast,
people who place their trust in other humans often live with a sense
of instability. The Bible compares them to desert shrubs that are
frequently malnourished and stand alone (v.6). So it is with the
spiritual lives of people who forsake God.

Where are our roots? Are we rooted in Jesus? (Col. 2:7). Are we a
bridge that leads others to Him? If we know Christ, we can testify to
this truth: Blessed are those who trust in the Lord (Jer. 17:7).

Jesus is all the world to me, My life, my joy, my all; He is my
strength from day to day, Without Him I would fall. —Thompson

Even strong trials cannot blow down a person who is rooted in God.
