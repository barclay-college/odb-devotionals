All Spruced Up

[Jesus] is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you
faultless. —
Jude 1:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jude 1:20-25

Getting our children to look good for church was always a challenge.
Ten minutes after arriving at church all spruced up, our little
Matthew would look like he didn’t have parents. I’d see him running
down the hall with his shirt half untucked, glasses cockeyed, shoes
scuffed up, and cookie crumbs decorating his clothes. Left to himself,
he was a mess.

I wonder if that is how we look sometimes. After Christ has clothed us
in His righteousness, we tend to wander off and live in ways that make
us look like we don’t belong to God. That’s why Jude’s promise that
Jesus is “able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you
faultless” gives me hope (Jude 1:24).

How can we keep from looking like we don’t have a heavenly Father? As
we become more yielded to His Spirit and His ways, He will keep us
from stumbling. Think of how increasingly righteous our lives would
become if we would take time in His Word to be cleansed with “the
washing of water by the word” (Eph. 5:26).

What a blessing that Jesus promises to take our stumbling, disheveled
lives and present us faultless to the Father! May we increasingly look
like children of the King as we reflect His loving care and attention.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for the blessing of being clothed in Your beautiful
righteousness and the promise that You will keep me from stumbling and
present me faultless before Your Father and my God!

To reflect the presence of the Father, we must rely on the Son.
