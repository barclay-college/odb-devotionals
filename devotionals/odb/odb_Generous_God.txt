Generous God

[God] is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or
think. —
Ephesians 3:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 3:14-21

When our family lived in Chicago several years ago, we enjoyed many
benefits. Near the top of my list were the amazing restaurants that
seemed to try to outdo each other, not only in great cuisine but also
in portion sizes. At one Italian eatery, my wife and I would order a
half portion of our favorite pasta dish and still have enough to bring
home for dinner the next night! The generous portions made us feel
like we were at Grandma’s house when she poured on the love through
her cooking.

I also feel an outpouring of love when I read that my heavenly Father
has lavished on us the riches of His grace (Eph. 1:7-8) and that He is
able to do “exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think”
(3:20). I’m so grateful that our God is not a stingy God who
begrudgingly dishes out His blessings in small portions. Rather, He is
the God who pours out forgiveness for the prodigal (Luke 15), and He
daily crowns us “with lovingkindness and tender mercies” (Ps. 103:4).

At times we think God hasn’t provided for us as we would like. But if
He never did anything more than forgive our sins and guarantee heaven
for us, He has already been abundantly generous! So today, let’s
rejoice in our generous God.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, remind me often that You have been exceedingly generous to me.
Help me to extend that generosity of spirit toward those around me, so
that they may know who You are and rejoice in You.

Praise God from whom all blessings flow!
