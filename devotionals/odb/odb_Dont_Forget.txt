Don’t Forget

Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God. —
Deuteronomy 8:11

Today's Scripture: Deuteronomy 8:7-18

I don’t agree with those who rail against material things and say that
owning stuff is inherently evil. And I have to admit that I’m a
consumer—often tempted to pad my pile of treasures with items I think
I need.

But I do recognize that one of the dangers of owning a lot of stuff is
that it can lead to spiritual loss. The more we have and the more we
feel as if we have all we need, the more prone we are to forget our
need for God and even our desire for Him. Yet, ironically, everything
we have comes ultimately from God, who “gives us richly all things to
enjoy” (1 Tim. 6:17).

Sadly, our enjoyment of God’s provisions might just mean that we end
up loving the gift and forgetting the Giver. This is why, when God was
getting ready to give His people a life full of bounty in the Promised
Land of good and plenty, He warned, “Beware that you do not forget the
Lord your God” (Deut. 8:11).

If God has allowed you to enjoy material abundance, remind yourself
where it came from. In fact, all of us, whether rich in this world’s
goods or not, have much to be thankful for. Let’s heed the warning not
to forget the Lord and praise Him for His abundant goodness.
