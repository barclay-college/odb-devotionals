Our Fearless Champion

Why are you fearful? —
Matthew 8:26

Today's Scripture: Matthew 8:23-34

Falling asleep was a challenging event during my childhood. No sooner
had my parents turned out the lights than the crumpled clothes I had
thrown on the chair would take on the form of a fiery dragon and the
thoughts of something living under my bed put me into a panic that
made sleep impossible.

I’ve come to realize that the immobilizing power of fear is not just a
childhood experience. Fear keeps us from forgiving, taking a stand at
the office, giving our resources to God’s kingdom, or saying no when
all our friends are saying yes. Left to ourselves, we are up against a
lot of fiery dragons in our lives.

In the story of the disciples in the storm-tossed boat, I’m struck by
the fact that the only one who was not afraid was Jesus. He was not
afraid of the storm, nor was He afraid of crazy men in a graveyard or
of the legion of demons that possessed him (Matt. 8:23-34).

In the face of fear, we need to hear Jesus ask, “Why are you fearful?”
(v.26) and be reminded that He will never leave us nor forsake us
(Heb. 13:5-6). There is nothing that He can’t overcome and therefore
nothing for Him to fear. So, next time you’re haunted by your fears,
remember that you can rely on Jesus, our fearless Champion!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for the reminder that You will never leave us nor
forsake us. When I am afraid, I know that I can rely on Your presence
and power to calm my heart and overcome my fears.

In times of fear, call out to Jesus, our fearless Champion.
