Just Another Sunday?

They continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine. —
Acts 2:42

Today's Scripture: Acts 2:41-47

Early on a sunny Sunday afternoon after church, I headed out for a
walk around the neighborhood. A man was trimming his grass along the
sidewalk, and we greeted each other with the usual “Hello, how are
you?” In a negative tone, he replied, “It’s just another Sunday.”
Later, I wondered what he had meant by that. Was he saying, I’m just
doing my chores—going through the motions?

Sometimes even church attendance can become a matter of merely going
through the motions on just another Sunday. For the believers in the
early church (Acts 2:41-47), joining with fellow believers was a
source of excitement. That was when the church first started and
everyone was a new believer—so they were bound to be enthusiastic. But
what about us? What can we do to make each Sunday special?

Go with the anticipation of meeting with God. While He is with us all
the time (Heb. 13:5), God is with us in a unique way as we gather with
others who know Him (Matt. 18:20; James 4:8). Bring your burdens and
praises to Him.

Go to learn about God. We may not learn something new every week, but
we can always be encouraged by the truths of God’s Word (Ps. 119:105).
Expect to hear from Him.

Go to fellowship with others. We need each other in this Christian
journey. Encourage others, challenge them in their faith, and pray for
them (Heb. 10:24-25).

Lord, give us a renewed enthusiasm of heart for attending church, so
that it won’t be just another Sunday.
