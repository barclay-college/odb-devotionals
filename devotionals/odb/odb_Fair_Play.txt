Fair Play

In everything set them an example by doing what is good.
Titus 2:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Titus 2:7–8, 11–14

When Singaporean runner Ashley Liew found himself at the head of the
pack during a marathon at the Southeast Asian Games, he knew something
was wrong. He quickly realized that the lead runners had taken a wrong
turn and were now behind. Ashley could have taken advantage of their
mistake, but a strong sense of sportsmanship told him it would not be
a genuine victory. He wanted to win because he was faster—not because
those ahead of him had made a mistake. Acting on his convictions, he
slowed down to let them catch up.

In the end, Ashley lost the race and missed out on a medal. But he won
the hearts of his countrymen—and an international award for his act of
fair play. It spoke well of his faith as a Christian, and must have
prompted some to ask, “What made him do that?”

Ashley’s act challenges me to share my faith through my actions.
Little acts of thoughtfulness, kindness, or forgiveness can glorify
God. As Paul put it simply, “Show integrity, seriousness and soundness
of speech that cannot be condemned” (Titus 2:7–8).

Our positive actions toward others can show the world that we are able
to live differently because of the Holy Spirit’s work in us. He will
give us the grace to reject ungodliness and wrong passions, and to
live upright lives that point people to God (vv. 11–12).

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, may our behavior today cause others to ask us why we
are different. We ask that we follow Your Holy Spirit’s leading as we
explain to them the hope that is in us.

Live so that others will want to know Jesus.
