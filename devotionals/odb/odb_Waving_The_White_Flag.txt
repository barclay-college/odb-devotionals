Waving The White Flag

Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the
Lord your God. —
Deuteronomy 6:4-5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Deuteronomy 6:1-9

Recently, while watching a video of a church service held in South
America, I noticed something I had never seen before in church. As the
pastor passionately called his flock to yield their lives to Jesus,
one of the parishioners took a white hankie out of his pocket and
started waving it in the air. Then another, and another. With tears
running down their cheeks, they were expressing full surrender to
Christ.

But I wonder if there was more to the moment than the flags of
surrender. I think they were waving flags of love to God. When God
told His people to “love the Lord your God” (Deut. 6:5), it was in the
context of His urging them to surrender their lives to Him.

From God’s point of view, life with Him is far more than just trying
to be good. It is always about relationship—relationship in which
surrender is the way we express our grateful love to Him. Jesus, in
amazing love for us, surrendered Himself on the cross to rescue us
from our helpless bondage to sin and set us on a journey to all that
is good and glorious.

We don’t have enough words to tell God how much we love Him! So, let’s
show Him our love by surrendering our hearts and lives to follow Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, take my life and make it wholly Thine; Fill my poor heart with
Thy great love divine. Take all my will, my passion, self, and pride;
I now surrender, Lord—in me abide. —Orr

Surrender is God’s love language.
