One Silent Night

Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all
people. —
Luke 2:10

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:1-14

Simon had emigrated from the Netherlands to the United States. His
wife, Kay, and all three of their children had been born in the US.
Then Jenny married Roberto from Panama. Bill married Vania from
Portugal. And Lucas married Bora from South Korea.

On Christmas Eve, as the family gathered for a celebration, they began
singing “Silent Night” in their native tongues—a sweet sound indeed
for the Lord of the earth to hear as they celebrated the birth of His
Son.

Two thousand years ago, the silence of a quiet night ended abruptly
when an angel told the shepherds a baby had been born: “Behold, I
bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people” (Luke
2:10). Then a multitude of angels began praising God, saying, “Glory
to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!”
(v.14). Christ the Lord, the Savior of the world, was born!

God’s gracious gift, His Son, which was announced on that long-ago
silent night, is still available to everyone—“every tribe and nation”
(Titus 2:11-14; Rev. 5:9-10). “For God so loved the world that He gave
His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish
but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).

Reflect & Pray

Silent night! holy night! Shepherds quake at the sight; Glories stream
from heaven afar, Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia— Christ the Savior is
born! Christ the Savior is born! —Mohr

Heaven’s choir came down to sing when heaven’s King came down to save.
