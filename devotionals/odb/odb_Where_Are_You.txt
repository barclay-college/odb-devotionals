Where Are You?

The Lord God . . . said to him, “Where are you?” —
Genesis 3:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Genesis 3:1-10

The two teenage boys heard the sound of their parents’ car and
panicked. How would they explain the mess in the house? Their father’s
instructions had been clear that morning before he and their mother
drove out of town: no parties, no rowdy friends. But the unruly
friends came and the boys allowed them to stay, despite their father’s
warning. Now the house was in a jumble and the boys were tipsy and
disheveled. In fear, they hid.

That was how Adam and Eve must have felt after they had chosen to
disobey God and then heard the sound of Him approaching. In fear, they
hid themselves. “Where are you?” God called (Gen. 3:9). Adam
responded, “I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because
I was naked; and I hid myself” (v.10). Sin makes us feel afraid and
naked, and we become vulnerable to even more temptation.

God is still calling to people: “Where are you?” Many run away, trying
to hide from Him or drown out the sound of His voice. Yet we cannot
hide from God; He knows exactly where we are. Rather than hide in
fear, we can respond in this way: “God, be merciful to me a sinner!”
(Luke 18:13).

Reflect & Pray

Would you be free from the burden of sin? There’s power in the blood,
power in the blood; Would you over evil a victory win? There’s
wonderful power in the blood. —Jones

The only place to hide sin is under the blood of Christ.
