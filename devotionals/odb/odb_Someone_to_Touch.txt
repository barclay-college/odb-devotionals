Someone to Touch

Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man.
Luke 5:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 5:12–16

Commuters on a Canadian Metro train witnessed a heart-moving
conclusion to a tense moment. They watched as a 70-year old woman
gently reached out and offered her hand to a young man whose loud
voice and disturbing words were scaring other passengers. The lady’s
kindness calmed the man who sank to the floor of the train with tears
in his eyes. He said, “Thanks, Grandma,” stood up, and walked away.
The woman later admitted to being afraid. But she said, “I’m a mother
and he needed someone to touch.” While better judgment might have
given her reason to keep her distance, she took a risk of love.

Jesus understands such compassion. He didn’t side with the fears of
unnerved onlookers when a desperate man, full of leprosy, showed up
begging to be healed. Neither was He helpless as other religious
leaders were—men who could only have condemned the man for bringing
his leprosy into the village (Lev. 13:45–46). Instead, Jesus reached
out to someone who probably hadn’t been touched by anyone for years,
and healed him.

Thankfully, for that man and for us, Jesus came to offer what no law
could ever offer—the touch of His hand and heart.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, please help us to see ourselves and one another in
that desperate man—and in the merciful eyes of Your Son who reached
out and touched him.

No one is too troubled or unclean to be touched by Jesus.
