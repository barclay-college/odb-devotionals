In the Moment

The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life . . . . No
one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.
John 10:17–18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 23:32–46

The ambulance door was about to close—with me on the inside. Outside,
my son was on the phone to my wife. From my concussed fog, I called
his name. As he recalls the moment, I slowly said, “Tell your mom I
love her very much.”

Apparently I thought this might be goodbye, and I wanted those to be
my parting words. In the moment, that’s what mattered most to me.

As Jesus endured His darkest moment, He didn’t merely tell us He loved
us; He showed it in specific ways. He showed it to the mocking
soldiers who had just nailed Him to a cross: “Father, forgive them,
for they do not know what they are doing” (Luke 23:34). He gave hope
to a criminal crucified with Him: “Today you will be with me in
paradise” (v. 43). Nearing the end, He looked at His mother. “Here is
your son,” He said to her, and to His close friend John He said, “Here
is your mother” (John 19:26–27). Then, as His life slipped from Him,
Jesus’s last act of love was to trust His Father: “Into your hands I
commit my spirit” (Luke 23:46).

Jesus purposefully chose the cross in order to show His obedience to
His Father—and the depth of His love for us. To the very end, He
showed us His relentless love.

What matters most to you? How do love and obedience fit together?

Every word of Jesus was spoken in love.
