Interruptions

The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart to all
generations. —
Psalm 33:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 5:21-34

My sister and I were looking forward to our holiday in Taiwan. We had
purchased our plane tickets and booked our hotel rooms. But 2 weeks
before the trip, my sister learned she had to stay at home in
Singapore to handle an emergency. We were disappointed that our plans
were interrupted.

Jesus’ disciples were accompanying Him on an urgent mission when their
trip was interrupted (Mark 5:21-42). The daughter of Jairus, a ruler
of the synagogue, was dying. Time was of the essence, and Jesus was on
His way to their home. Then, suddenly, Jesus stopped and said, “Who
touched My clothes?” (v.30).

The disciples seemed irritated by this and said, “You see the
multitude thronging You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’” (v.31). But
Jesus saw it as an opportunity to minister to a suffering woman. Her
illness had made her ceremonially unclean and unable to participate in
community life for 12 years! (see Lev. 15:25-27).

While Jesus was talking to this woman, Jairus’ daughter died. It was
too late—or so it seemed. But the delay allowed Jairus to experience
an even deeper knowledge of Jesus and His power—even power over death!

Sometimes our disappointment can be God’s appointment.

Reflect & Pray

Disappointment—His appointment No good thing will He withhold; From
denials oft we gather Treasures of His love untold. —Young

Look for God’s purpose in your next interruption.
