Virtuoso

1 Corinthians 10:31

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 10:31–11:1

A major US newspaper has called Christopher Parkening “the leading
guitar virtuoso of our day, combining profound musical insight with
complete technical mastery of his instrument.” There was a time,
however, when Parkening gave up playing the guitar professionally. At
the height of his career as a classical guitarist, he retired at age
30, bought a ranch in Montana, and spent his days fly-fishing. But
early retirement did not bring him the satisfaction he had hoped for.

Then during a visit to California, he was invited to a church where he
heard a clear presentation of the gospel. Of this he wrote: “That
night I lay awake, broken over my sins. . . . I had lived very
selfishly and it had not made me happy. . . . It was then that I asked
Jesus Christ to come into my life, to be my Lord and Savior. For the
first time, I remember telling Him, ‘Whatever You want me to do with
my life, Lord, I’ll do it.’”

One of Parkening’s favorite verses is 1 Corinthians 10:31, “Therefore,
. . . whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” He has taken up
the guitar again, but this time with the motivation to glorify God.

Each of us has been given gifts; and when we use them for God’s glory,
they bring satisfaction and joy.
