The Growth Chart

Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. —
2 Peter 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Peter 3:10-18

If my family ever moves from the house where we live now, I want to
unhinge the pantry door and take it with me! That door is special
because it shows how my children have grown over the years. Every few
months, my husband and I place our children against the door and
pencil a mark just above their heads. According to our growth chart,
my daughter shot up 4 inches in just 1 year!

While my children grow physically as a natural part of life, there’s
another kind of growth that happens with some effort—our spiritual
growth in Christlikeness. Peter encouraged believers to “grow in the
grace and knowledge” of Jesus (2 Peter 3:18). He said that maturing in
our faith prepares us for Christ’s return. The apostle wanted Jesus to
come back and find believers living in peace and righteousness (v.14).
Peter viewed spiritual growth as a defense against teaching that
incorrectly interprets God’s Word and leads people astray (vv.16-17).

Even when we feel discouraged and disconnected from God, we can
remember that He will help us advance in our faith by making us more
like His Son. His Word assures us that “He who has begun a good work
in [us] will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, I invite Your Holy Spirit to mold me into the person You
want me to be. Empower me to keep reaching for the holiness I see in
Jesus.

Spiritual growth requires the solid food of God’s Word.
