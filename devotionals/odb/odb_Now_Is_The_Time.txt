Now Is The Time

Glory to God in the highest! —
Luke 2:14

Today's Scripture: Luke 2:8-20

During our church’s Christmas celebration, I watched the choir members
assemble in front of the congregation while the music director rifled
through papers on a slim black stand. The instruments began, and the
singers launched into a well-known song that started with these words:
“Come, now is the time to worship.”

Although I expected to hear a time-honored Christmas carol, I smiled
at the appropriate choice of music. Earlier that week I had been
reading Luke’s account of Jesus’ birth, and I noticed that the first
Christmas lacked our modern-day parties, gifts, and feasting—but it
did include worship.

After the angel announced Jesus’ birth to some wide-eyed shepherds, a
chorus of angels began “praising God and saying: ‘Glory to God in the
highest!’” (Luke 2:13-14). The shepherds responded by running to
Bethlehem where they found the newborn King lying in a barnyard
bassinet. They returned to their fields “glorifying and praising God
for all the things that they had heard and seen” (v.20). Coming face
to face with the Son inspired the shepherds to worship the Father.

Today, consider your response to Jesus’ arrival on earth. Is there
room for worship in your heart on this day that celebrates His birth?

Reflect & Pray

Grant us, Father, hearts of worship At this time of Jesus’ birth; We
would see anew His glory Shine throughout this sin-cursed earth. —D.
De Haan

Heaven’s choir came down to sing when heaven’s King came down to save.
