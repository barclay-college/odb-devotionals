What’s The Trouble?

Be sure your sin will find you out. —
Numbers 32:23

Today's Scripture: Joshua 7:1-13

There was something wrong with my lawn. I couldn’t see what the
trouble was, but I knew something was causing damage.

After investigating, I discovered the problem: moles. Those voracious
little bug-eaters were crawling around just under the surface of my
previously well-groomed lawn looking for food and wreaking havoc on my
grass.

The children of Israel also had a problem with a hidden cause (Josh.
7). They were experiencing trouble, and they couldn’t figure out why.
There was something hidden from their view that was causing serious
damage.

The trouble became noticeable when Joshua sent 3,000 troops to attack
Ai. Although that should have been a sufficient army to defeat Ai’s
small force, the opposite happened. Ai routed the Israelites, killing
36 of them and chasing them back where they came from. Joshua had no
idea why this trouble had come. Then God explained the hidden problem:
One of his men, Achan, had violated a clear command and had stolen
some “accursed things” from Jericho (Josh. 7:11). Only when that
hidden sin was discovered and taken care of could Israel have victory.

Hidden sin does great damage. We need to bring it to the surface and
deal with it—or face certain defeat.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, I don’t want anything in my life to hinder my fellowship
with You. You know what’s in my heart. Reveal any areas of my life
that are not pleasing to You and forgive me. Amen.

Confession to God ensures forgiveness.
