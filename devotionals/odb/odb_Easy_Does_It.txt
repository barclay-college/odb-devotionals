Easy Does It

It is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his
good purpose.
Philippians 2:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 2:12–18

My father and I used to fell trees and cut them to size with a two-man
crosscut saw. Being young and energetic, I tried to force the saw into
the cut. “Easy does it,” my father would say. “Let the saw do the
work.”

I think of Paul’s words in Philippians: “It is God who works in you”
(2:13). Easy does it. Let Him do the work of changing us.

C. S. Lewis said that growth is much more than reading what Christ
said and carrying it out. He explained, “A real Person, Christ, . . .
is doing things to you . . . gradually turning you permanently into .
. . a new little Christ, a being which . . . shares in His power, joy,
knowledge and eternity.”

God is at that process today. Sit at the feet of Jesus and take in
what He has to say. Pray. “Keep yourselves in God’s love” (Jude 1:21),
reminding yourself all day long that you are His. Rest in the
assurance that He’s gradually changing you.

“But shouldn’t we hunger and thirst for righteousness?” you ask.
Picture a small child trying to get a gift high on a shelf, his eyes
glittering with desire. His father, sensing that desire, brings the
gift down to him.

The work is God’s; the joy is ours. Easy does it. We shall get there
some day.

Reflect & Pray

What does it mean to you that “It is God who works in you”? What do
you want Him to do in you?

God, I’m grateful that You’re changing my heart and actions to make me
like Jesus. Please give me a humble attitude to learn from You.
