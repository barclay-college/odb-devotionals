Dying for Others

I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the
sheep.
John 10:11

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 John 3:16–17

I love birds, which is why I bought six caged birds and carried them
home to our daughter Alice, who began to care for them daily. Then one
of the birds fell ill and died. We wondered if the birds would be more
likely to thrive if they were not caged. So we freed the surviving
five and observed them fly away in jubilation.

Alice then pointed out, “Do you realize, Daddy, that it was the death
of one bird that caused us to free the rest?”

Isn’t that what the Lord Jesus did for us? Just as one man’s sin
(Adam’s) brought condemnation to the world, so one Man’s righteousness
(Jesus’s) brought salvation to those who believe (Rom. 5:12–19). Jesus
said, “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life
for the sheep” (John 10:11).

John makes it more practical when he says, “Jesus Christ laid down his
life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and
sisters” (1 John 3:16). This won’t likely mean literal death, but as
we align our lives with Jesus’s example of sacrificial love, we find
that we are “laying down our lives.” For instance, we might choose to
deprive ourselves of material goods in order to share them with others
(v. 17) or make time to be with someone who needs comfort and
companionship.

Who do you need to sacrifice for today?
