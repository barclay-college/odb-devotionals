The Kindness Man

When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her.
Luke 7:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 7:11–17

Disillusioned and wanting a more meaningful life, Leon quit his job in
finance. Then one day he saw a homeless man holding up this sign at a
street corner: KINDNESS IS THE BEST MEDICINE. Leon says, “Those words
rammed straight into me. It was an epiphany.”

Leon decided to begin his new life by creating an international
organization to promote kindness. He travels around the world, relying
on strangers to provide him with food, gas, and a place to stay. Then
he rewards them, through his organization, with good deeds such as
feeding orphans or building on to a school for underprivileged
children. He says, “It’s sometimes seen as being soft. But kindness is
a profound strength.”

Christ’s very essence as God is goodness, so kindness naturally flowed
from Him. I love the story of what Jesus did when He came upon the
funeral procession of a widow’s only son (Luke 7:11–17). The grieving
woman most likely was dependent on her son for financial support. We
don’t read in the story that anyone asked Jesus to intervene. Purely
from the goodness of His nature (v. 13), He was concerned and brought
her son back to life. The people said of Christ, “God has come to help
his people” (v. 16).

Reflect & Pray

What kindnesses does Jesus pour out on you? List them and thank Him.

You, God, are always showering me with Your gifts of love. I praise
You for caring for me.
