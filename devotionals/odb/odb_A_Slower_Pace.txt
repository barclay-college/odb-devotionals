A Slower Pace

Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work. —
Exodus 20:9-10

Today's Scripture: Exodus 20:8-11

When writer Bruce Feiler was diagnosed with bone cancer in his thigh,
he couldn’t walk without some help for over a year. Learning to get
around on crutches caused him to appreciate a slower pace of life.
Feiler said, “The idea of slowing down became the number one lesson I
learned from my experience.”

After God’s people were liberated from Egypt, He gave them a
commandment that would cause them to slow down and view Him and the
world “in pause.” The fourth commandment introduced a dramatic
contrast to the Israelites’ slavery under Pharaoh when they had no
break in their daily work routine.

The commandment insisted that God’s people set aside one day a week to
remember several important things: God’s work in creation (Gen. 2:2),
their liberation from Egyptian bondage (Deut. 5:12-15), their
relationship with God (6:4-6), and their need for personal refreshment
(Exod. 31:12-18). This was not to be a day of laziness, but one where
God’s people acknowledged, worshiped, and rested in Him.

We too are called to slow down, to be refreshed physically, mentally,
and emotionally, and to behold God in His good creation.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, I need spiritual and physical rest. Help me to deliberately take
the time to spend with You. Please remove any obstacle that keeps me
from having a more balanced rhythm to my life.

Living for God begins with resting in Him.
