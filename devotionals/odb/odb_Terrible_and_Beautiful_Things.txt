Terrible and Beautiful Things

Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
Psalm 57:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 57

Fear can leave us frozen. We know all the reasons to be
afraid—everything that’s hurt us in the past, everything that could
easily do so again. So sometimes we’re stuck—unable to go back; too
afraid to move forward. I just can’t do it. I’m not smart enough,
strong enough, or brave enough to handle being hurt like that again.

I’m captivated by how author Frederick Buechner describes God’s grace:
like a gentle voice that says, “Here is the world. Terrible and
beautiful things will happen. Don’t be afraid. I am with you.”

Terrible things will happen. In our world, hurting people hurt other
people, often terribly. Like the psalmist David, we carry our own
stories of when evil surrounded us, when, like “ravenous beasts,”
others wounded us (Psalm 57:4). And so we grieve; we cry out (vv.
1–2).

But because God is with us, beautiful things can happen too. As we run
to Him with our hurts and fears, we find ourselves carried by a love
far greater than anyone’s power to harm us (vv. 1–3), a love so deep
it fills the skies (v. 10). Even when disaster rages around us, His
love is a solid refuge where our hearts find healing (vv. 1, 7). Until
one day we’ll find ourselves awakening to renewed courage, ready to
greet the day with a song of His faithfulness (vv. 8–10).
