Baby Steps

He makes my feet like the feet of a deer. —
Psalm 18:33

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 18:31-36

My baby is learning to walk. I have to hold her, and she clings to my
fingers because she is still unsteady on her feet. She is afraid of
slipping, but I’m there to steady her and watch over her. As she walks
with my help, her eyes sparkle with gratitude, happiness, and
security. But sometimes she cries when I don’t let her take dangerous
paths, not realizing that I am protecting her.

Like my baby girl, we often need someone to watch over us, to guide
and steady us in our spiritual walk. And we have that someone—God our
Father—who helps His children learn to walk, guides our steps, holds
our hand, and keeps us on the right path.

King David knew all about the need for God’s watchful care in his
life. In Psalm 18 he describes how God gives us strength and guidance
when we are lost or confused (v. 32). He keeps our feet steady, like
the feet of the deer that can climb high places without slipping (v.
33). And if we do slip, His hand is there for us (v. 35).

Whether we are new believers just learning to walk in the faith or we
are further along in our walk with God, all of us need His guiding,
steadying hand.

Dear Father, hold my hand and lead me in the paths of right living.

God watches over me every step of the way.
