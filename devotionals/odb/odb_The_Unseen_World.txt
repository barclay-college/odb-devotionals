The Unseen World

The Angel of the Lord [was] standing in the way. —
Numbers 22:23

Today's Scripture: Numbers 22:21-31

Did you know that the microbes on just one of your hands outnumber all
of the people on the earth? Or that millions of microbes could fit
into the eye of a needle? These one-celled, living organisms are too
small for us to see without a microscope, yet they live in the air,
soil, water, and even in our bodies. We constantly interact with them,
even though their world is completely beyond our senses.

The realities of the spiritual world are also often not visible to us
humans, as the prophet Balaam discovered. He was trudging along the
road with his two servants when his donkey “saw the Angel of the Lord
standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand” (Num. 22:23). To
avoid the angel, the animal walked into a field, crushed Balaam’s foot
against a wall, and lay down with Balaam still on her back. Balaam was
angry and struck the donkey. He didn’t realize something supernatural
was going on—until God opened his eyes (v.31).

The Bible tells us that a spiritual world does exist, and we may
sometimes encounter realities from that realm—both good and bad (Heb.
13:2; Eph. 6:12). Because of this, we are encouraged to be watchful,
prayerful, and prepared. Just as God rules the world we see, He also
rules the unseen world.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, help us to be strong in You and in the power of Your
might. Open our eyes so that we may see the spiritual realities You
have for us.

All that is seen and unseen is under God’s sovereign power.
