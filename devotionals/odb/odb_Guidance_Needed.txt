Guidance Needed

When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all
truth. —
John 16:13

Today's Scripture: John 16:13–17

St. Nicholas Church in Galway, Ireland, has both a long history and an
active present. It’s the oldest church in Ireland, and it provides
guidance in a very practical way. The church towers over the town, and
its steeple is used by ships’ captains as a guide for navigating their
way safely into Galway Bay. For centuries, this church has reliably
pointed the way home for sailors.

We can all certainly identify with the need for guidance. In fact,
Jesus addressed this very need during His Upper Room Discourse. He
said that after His departure the Holy Spirit would play a crucial
role in the lives of believers. As part of that role, Jesus promised,
“When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all
truth” (John 16:13).

What a marvelous provision! In a world of confusion and fear, guidance
is often needed. We can easily be misdirected by the culture around us
or by the brokenness within us (1 John 2:15-17). God’s Spirit,
however, is here to help, to direct, and to guide. How thankful we can
be that the Spirit of truth has come to give us the guidance that we
often so desperately need. Set your course by His life, and you will
reach safe harbor.
