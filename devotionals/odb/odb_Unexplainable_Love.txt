Unexplainable Love

As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
John 13:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 13:31–35

Our small congregation decided to surprise my son on his sixth
birthday. The church members decorated his Sunday school classroom
with balloons and set up a small table with a cake on it. When my son
opened the door, everyone shouted, “Happy birthday!”

Later on, as I was cutting the cake, my son came over and whispered in
my ear, “Mom, why does everyone here love me?” I had the same
question! These people had known us for only six months but were
treating us as longtime friends.

Their love for my son reflected God’s love for us. We can’t understand
why He loves us, but He does—and His love is freely given. We’ve done
nothing to deserve His love, and yet He lavishly loves us. Scripture
tells us: “God is love” (1 John 4:8). It’s part of who He is.

God has poured out His love on us so we can show this same love to
others. Jesus told His disciples, “As I have loved you, so you must
love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my
disciples, if you love one another” (John 13:34–35).

The people in our small church community love us because God’s love is
in them. It shines through and identifies them as followers of Jesus.
We can’t comprehend God’s love fully, but we can pour it out
on others—being examples of His unexplainable love.
