On My Side

The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. —
Psalm 118:6

Today's Scripture: Psalm 118:1-6

After Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas captured two gold medals in the
2012 London Games, she made this proclamation: “God will never fail
you. He’s always on your side.”

Sometimes this kind of statement by an athlete can be misunderstood.
It can be taken to mean that if I’m competing against you in a sports
contest and I have God’s help, there is no way I can lose. But if we
turn to Psalm 118:5-6, we get the true picture of what this line
means—and what Gabby meant. The psalmist wrote, “I called on the Lord
in distress; the Lord answered me and set me in a broad place. The
Lord is on my side; I will not fear.”

Another version translates verse 6 as “the Lord is with me” (niv).
It’s the idea that when trouble comes into our lives, God, who is full
of mercy and love (which “endures forever,” v.4) will always be
attentive to us and provide the protection we need.

We can learn from this heroic Olympic champion. When the economy
falters and our finances can’t keep up, listen to Gabby: “God will
never fail you.” When a relationship we cherished falls apart; indeed,
no matter what our situation, as Christ-followers we know where to
find help. “The Lord is on my side.”

Reflect & Pray

Be still, my soul—the Lord is on thy side! Bear patiently the cross of
grief or pain; Leave to thy God to order and provide— In every change
He faithful will remain. —von Schlegel

In the midst of every trial, God is on our side.
