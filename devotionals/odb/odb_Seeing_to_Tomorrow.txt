Seeing to Tomorrow

We live by faith, not by sight.
2 Corinthians 5:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Corinthians 5:1–9

I enjoy gazing up at a cloudless blue sky. The sky is a beautiful part
of our great Creator’s masterpiece, given for us to enjoy. Imagine how
much pilots must love the view. They use several aeronautical terms to
describe a perfect sky for flying, but my favorite is, “You can see to
tomorrow.”

“Seeing to tomorrow” is beyond our view. Sometimes we even struggle to
see or understand what life is throwing at us today. The Bible tells
us, “Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your
life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then
vanishes” (James 4:14).

But our limited visibility is not cause for despair. Just the
opposite. We trust in the God who sees all of our tomorrows
perfectly—and who knows what we need as we face the challenges ahead.
The apostle Paul knew this. That’s why Paul encourages us with hopeful
words, “We live by faith, not by sight” (2 Cor. 5:7).

When we trust God with our day as well as our unseen tomorrows, we
don’t need to worry about anything life throws at us. We walk with Him
and He knows what is ahead; He is strong enough and wise enough to
handle it.
