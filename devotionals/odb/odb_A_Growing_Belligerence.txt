A Growing Belligerence

If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all
men. —
Romans 12:18

Today's Scripture: Philippians 4:4-9

On a recent trip, the flight attendant asked if I flew very often.
When I said I did, he asked, “Have you noticed people on planes
becoming increasingly more belligerent and aggressive in recent
months?” I had to confess that I agreed with him. We began talking
about what might be contributing to it—things like increased airport
security, higher costs, fewer services, and a general dissatisfaction
with travel. As if to prove the point, our conversation was
interrupted by a passenger who refused to sit in his assigned seat
because he liked someone else’s seat assignment better!

When we encounter anger and belligerence, the follower of Christ can
be a peacemaker. Paul wrote to the church at Rome with this challenge,
“If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all
men” (Rom. 12:18). What does that mean? For one thing, it means that
we must control what we can control. We can’t control the attitudes of
others, but we can control our response.

When we see angry or hostile attitudes displayed around us, we can
show the heart of the Prince of Peace by responding graciously in a
peaceful manner. In this way we will demonstrate the attitude of our
Savior in a world filled with a growing belligerence.

Reflect & Pray

Sometimes in a conversation Words of anger can be heard; If in peace
we can defuse it, We are living by God’s Word. —Hess

The world needs a peace that passes all misunderstanding.
