Capture The Moment

See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise,
redeeming the time. —
Ephesians 5:15-16

Today's Scripture: Ephesians 5:8-21

My wife, Martie, is a great shopper. When she shops for groceries, she
reads all the nutrition labels and considers the best deal by looking
at the price per unit. But her best trick is looking for the “use by”
date. She doesn’t just grab the first gallon of milk she sees, but
rather she goes for the gallon with the latest “use by” date so she
can bring home the freshest milk from the store.

In a sense, our lives are marked by “use by” dates—except that none of
us knows the exact date when our heart will expire or we’ll take our
last breath on this planet. Given that reality, shouldn’t we try a
little harder to capture the moments we’ve been given? Capturing the
moment means that we’ll do things like love more deeply, forgive more
quickly, listen more carefully, and speak more affirmingly.

Paul gives this good advice: “See then that you walk circumspectly,
not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are
evil” (Eph. 5:15-16). He also instructs us to “walk as children of
light . . . finding out what is acceptable to the Lord” (vv.8-10).

Since none of us knows our “use by” date, we should capture the
opportunities to brighten our world with the love of Christ today!

Lord, grant me grace throughout this day To walk the straight and
narrow way, To do whatever in Thy sight Is good and perfect, just and
right. —Huisman
