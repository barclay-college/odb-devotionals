Your Father Knows

Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
Matthew 6:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:25–34

I was only four years old as I lay by my father on a floor mat on a
hot summer night. (My mother, with a baby, had her own room at the
time.) This was in northern Ghana where the climate is mostly dry.
Sweat covered my body, and the heat parched my throat. I felt so
thirsty I shook my father awake. In the middle of that dry night, he
rose up and poured water from a jar for me to quench my thirst.
Throughout my life, as he did that night, he exemplified the image of
a caring father. He provided what I needed.

Some people may not have a good father figure in their lives. But we
all have a Father who is strong and ever-present and who does not
disappoint us. Jesus taught us to pray to “our Father in heaven”
(Matt. 6:9). He told us that when our daily needs confront us—food,
clothing, shelter, protection (v. 31)—“your Father knows what you need
before you ask him” (v. 8).

We have a Father who is always there. Night or day, whenever the going
gets tough, we can trust that He will never abandon us. He has
promised to care for us, and He knows better than we do what we need.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for the privilege of coming to You as my Father. You
know my needs before I even ask. Thank You that You will never turn
me away.

Your loving heavenly Father never takes His eyes off you.
