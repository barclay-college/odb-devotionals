A Message From God

God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to
the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by
His Son. —
Hebrews 1:1-2

Today's Scripture: Hebrews 1:1-9

In 1971, Ray Tomlinson was experi- menting with ways people and
computers could interact. When he sent a message from his computer
through a network to a different unit in his office, he had sent the
first e-mail. Now decades later, more than a billion e-mails are sent
every day. Many contain important news from family and friends, but
others may carry unwanted advertising or a destructive virus. A basic
rule governing e-mail use is: “Don’t open it unless you trust the
sender.”

God has sent us a message in the Person of His Son, and we can trust
the Sender. In the Old Testament, God spoke to His people through the
prophets and many rejected God’s Word. But it was all leading to this:
“God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to
the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by
His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also
He made the worlds” (Heb. 1:1-2).

We may be awed by the inexplicable mystery of Almighty God entering
our world as a baby, yet remain hesitant to embrace Christ fully and
place our lives in His hands.

Christmas is the unforgettable message of love, redemption, and hope
sent by God. Will you trust the Sender and open His message today?

Reflect & Pray

Mild He lays His glory by, Born that man no more may die. Born to
raise the sons of earth, Born to give them second birth. —Wesley

God’s timeless message of hope is waiting to be received.
