The Money

You cannot serve both God and money.
Matthew 6:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 6:24–34

Early in my career while doing work that I saw as more of a mission
than a job, another company offered me a position that would give a
significant increase in pay. Our family could surely have benefited
financially from such a move. There was one problem. I hadn’t been
looking for another job because I loved my current role, which was
growing into a calling.

But the money . . .

I called my father, then in his seventies, and explained the
situation. Though his once-sharp mind had been slowed by strokes and
the strain of years, his answer was crisp and clear: “Don’t even think
about the money. What would you do?”

In an instant, my mind was made up. The money would have been my only
reason for leaving the job I loved! Thanks, Dad.

Jesus devoted a substantial section of His Sermon on the Mount to
money and our fondness for it. He taught us to pray not for an
accumulation of riches but for “our daily bread” (Matt. 6:11). He
warned against storing up treasures on earth and pointed to the birds
and flowers as evidence that God cares deeply about His creation (vv.
19–31). “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness,” Jesus said,
“and all these things will be given to you as well” (v. 33).

Money matters. But money shouldn’t rule our decision-making process.
Tough times and big decisions are opportunities to grow our faith in
new ways. Our heavenly Father cares for us.
