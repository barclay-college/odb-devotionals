Hubble, Zoos, And Singing Children

Praise Him, all you stars of light! —
Psalm 148:3

Today's Scripture: Psalm 148

What do the Hubble Space Telescope, a zoo, and singing children have
in common? According to the teaching of Psalm 148, we could conclude
that they all point to God’s magnificent creation.

The idea that God created our world is often questioned, so perhaps
it’s a good time for a reminder of the praise we and all creation
should heap on our heavenly Father for His magnificent handiwork.

Hubble can help us with that through its eye-popping pictures of our
universe. Every one of those brilliant photos points to stars that
focus attention on God’s creative majesty. “Praise Him, all you stars
of light!” says verse 3.

A visit to a zoo points us to the great diversity of wildlife God
created. We look at verses 7 and 10 and say thank you to God for sea
creatures, wild animals, insects, and birds.

And a few minutes of watching little children singing uninhibited
praises to God symbolizes the truth that all people of earth should
lift their voices in honor of our Creator (vv.11-13).

Stars, animals, and children: “Let them praise the name of the Lord,
for His name alone is exalted” (v.13). Let’s join in saying thanks for
His creation. “Praise the Lord!”

Reflect & Pray

Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation! O my soul,
praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation! All ye who hear, now
to His temple draw near; Join me in glad adoration! —Neander

Creation displays God’s power.
