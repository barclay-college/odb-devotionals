Out of the Ruins

He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair
its ruins.
Ezra 9:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Lamentations 5:8-22

In the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem you’ll find Tiferet Yisrael
Synagogue. Built in the 19th century, the synagogue was dynamited by
commandos during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

For years the site lay in ruins. Then, in 2014, rebuilding began. As
city officials set a piece of rubble as the cornerstone, one of them
quoted from Lamentations: “Restore us to yourself, Lord, that we may
return; renew our days as of old” (5:21).

Lamentations is Jeremiah’s funeral song for Jerusalem. With graphic
imagery the prophet describes the impact of war on his city. Verse 21
is his heartfelt prayer for God to intervene. Still, the prophet
wonders if that is even possible. He concludes his anguished song with
this fearful caveat: “unless you have utterly rejected us and are
angry with us beyond measure” (v. 22). Decades later, God did answer
that prayer as the exiles returned to Jerusalem.

Our lives too may seem to be in ruins. Troubles of our own making and
conflicts we can’t avoid may leave us devastated. But we have a Father
who understands. Gently, patiently, He clears away the rubble,
repurposes it, and builds something better. It takes time, but we can
always trust Him. He specializes in rebuilding projects.
