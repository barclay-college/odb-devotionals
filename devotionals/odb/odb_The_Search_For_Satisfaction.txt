The Search For Satisfaction

Why do you spend money for what is not bread, and your wages for what
does not satisfy? —
Isaiah 55:2

Today's Scripture: Isaiah 55:1-6

When it comes to jigsaw puzzles, we all know that to enjoy a
satisfying outcome you need all the pieces. In many ways, life is like
that. We spend our days putting it together, hoping to create a
complete picture out of all the scattered parts.

Yet sometimes it seems like a piece is missing. Perhaps we’ve been
pursuing the wrong pieces to the puzzle. Even though we may know that
life without God at the center is a life that has lost the most
important piece, do we live as though He isn’t particularly relevant?
And even though we may attend church regularly, is He the throbbing
center of our lives? Sometimes we grow accustomed to feeling distant
from God. This makes it easier to sin, complicating the sense that
something important is missing.

But no matter how far we may drift from God, He wants us near. He
appealed to His people through the prophet Isaiah: “Why do you spend
money for what is not bread, and your wages for what does not satisfy?
Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul
delight itself in abundance” (Isa. 55:2).

If something is missing in your life, remember that God is the only
One who can fully and abundantly satisfy you. Let Him complete the
picture of your life.

Reflect & Pray

The God-shaped void within our heart Cannot be filled by treasure;
It’s only God who satisfies In ways we cannot measure. —Sper

There’s a longing in every heart that only Jesus can satisfy.
