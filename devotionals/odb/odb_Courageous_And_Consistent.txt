Courageous And Consistent

When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage. —
Acts 28:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Acts 28:11-16,30-31

While reading the obituary of Eugene Patterson, Pulitzer Prize-winning
editor of the Atlanta Constitution from 1960 to 1968, I was struck by
two things. First, for many years Patterson was a fearless voice for
civil rights during a time when many opposed racial equality. In
addition, he wrote a column every day for 8 years. That’s 2,922
newspaper columns! Day after day, year after year. Courage and
consistency were key factors in the impact of his life.

We see those same qualities in the apostle Paul. Acts 13–28 records
his bravery in one harrowing situation after another. After being
shipwrecked on his way to stand trial before Caesar, he landed south
of Rome, where many brothers in Christ came to meet him (Acts
28:11-15). “When Paul saw them,” Luke wrote, “he thanked God and took
courage” (v.15). During the next 2 years as a prisoner, Paul was
allowed to live in his own rented house where he “received all who
came to him, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things
which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence” (vv.30-31).

Every follower of Jesus can be a consistent giver and receiver of
courage. The Lord can use us today to encourage and strengthen each
other.

Reflect & Pray

O keep up your courage, each day to the end; Go forth in the strength
of the Lord; Trust wholly in Jesus, thy Savior and Friend, And feed on
His own blessed Word. —Miles

When people share their fears with you, share your courage with them.
