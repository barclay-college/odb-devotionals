Rings and Grace

[I] will remember their sins no more.
Hebrews 8:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 8:6–13

When I look at my hands, I am reminded that I lost my wedding and
engagement rings. I was multitasking as I packed for a trip, and I
still have no idea where they ended up.

I dreaded telling my husband about my careless mistake—worried how the
news would affect him. But he responded with more compassion and care
for me than concern over the rings. However, there are times when I
still want to do something to earn his grace! He, on the contrary,
doesn’t hold this episode against me.

So many times we remember our sins and feel we must do something to
earn God’s forgiveness. But God has said it is by grace, not by works,
that we are saved (Eph. 2:8–9). Speaking of a new covenant, God
promised Israel, “I will forgive their wickedness and will remember
their sins no more” (Jer. 31:34). We have a God who forgives and no
longer calls to mind the wrongs we have done.

We may still feel sad about our past, but we need to trust His promise
and believe His grace and forgiveness is real through faith in Jesus
Christ. This news should lead us to thankfulness and the assurance
faith brings. When God forgives, He forgets.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, thank You for Your grace and Your offer of salvation and
forgiveness through Christ. Thank You for this free gift that is not
based on anything I can do.

Grace and forgiveness are unearned gifts.
