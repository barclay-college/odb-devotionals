Language of Love

With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse
human beings, who have been made in God’s likeness.
James 3:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: James 3:1–12

When my grandmother came to Mexico as a missionary, she had a hard
time learning Spanish. One day she went to the market. She showed her
shopping list to the girl helping her and said, “It’s in two tongues
(lenguas).” But she meant to say that she had written it in two
languages (idiomas). The butcher overheard them and assumed she wanted
to purchase two cow tongues. My grandmother didn’t realize it until
she got home. She had never cooked beef tongue before!

Mistakes are inevitable when we are learning a second language,
including learning the new language of God’s love. At times our speech
is contradictory because we praise the Lord but then speak badly of
others. Our old sinful nature opposes our new life in Christ. What
comes out of our mouths shows us how much we need God’s help.

Our old “tongue” must go away. The only way to learn the new language
of love is by making Jesus the Lord of our speech. When the Holy
Spirit works in us, He gives us self-control to speak words that
please the Father. May we surrender every word to Him! “Set a guard
over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips” (Ps. 141:3).

Reflect & Pray

Lord Jesus, take control of my mouth today. Forgive me for careless,
thoughtless, and angry words. Let my words bless You and others.

May the words we speak point others to Jesus.
