Miracle Or Magic?

Though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and
believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him. —
John 10:38

Today's Scripture: John 10:24-42

Did Jesus really walk on water or simply use some nearby sandbars? Did
He actually multiply bread and fish to feed 5,000 or just hypnotize
the crowd into thinking He did? Was it miracle or magic?

When Christian illusionist Brock Gill explored those questions for a
BBC television program, he set aside his personal beliefs to examine
the biblical miracles with an open mind. Producer Jean-Claude Bragard
said, “Even if an atheist had been chosen as host, the conclusions
wouldn’t have changed.” In every case, Gill concluded that Jesus could
not have tricked people into believing they had witnessed a miracle.

But many who actually saw Jesus’ miracles refused to believe that He
was the Messiah. They were ready to execute Him for claiming to be God
(John 10:30-31). Jesus told them, “If I do not do the works of My
Father, do not believe Me; but if I do, though you do not believe Me,
believe the [miracles], that you may know and believe that the Father
is in Me, and I in Him” (vv.37-38).

The miracles of Jesus identified Him as the Son of God, the Savior who
had come to give His life for the sins of the world. His works and
resurrection were not magic tricks, but miracles of love and grace.
