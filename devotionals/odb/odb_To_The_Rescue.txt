To The Rescue

There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over
ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance. —
Luke 15:7

Today's Scripture: Luke 15:1-7

Martie and I recently traveled to some major cities in several
countries. We were struck with how lost our world is and grieved over
the millions who have never heard the message of the saving grace of
Jesus. The thought of reaching our world for Christ felt overwhelming.

Until I remembered the story of the boy walking on a beach.
Encountering hundreds of starfish dying under the heat of the burning
sun, he started throwing them back into the sea. A passerby asked,
“What are you doing?” “Saving their lives,” the boy replied. “Forget
it,” the man said. “You can’t possibly save all these starfish.”
“Right,” replied the boy, “but it makes a big difference to each one I
do save.”

I love the boy’s perspective. When the wave of sin threw us onto the
shore to die, God sent His Son to walk on the beach to rescue all who
would repent. And, as Jesus told His listeners in Luke 15, each time
someone is rescued, heaven throws a party. “I say to you that likewise
there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over
ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance” (Luke 15:7).

Has heaven rejoiced over your rescue? If so, join the ranks of those
who reach other lost souls with the rescuing grace of Jesus.

Reflect & Pray

Your love, O God, would spare no pain To conquer death and win; You
sent Your only Son to die To rescue us from sin. —M. Gustafson

When you’ve been rescued, you’ll want to rescue others.
