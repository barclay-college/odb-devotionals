The Beauty of Rome

Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God.
John 17:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 17:1–5

The glory of the Roman Empire offered an expansive backdrop for the
birth of Jesus. In 27 bc Rome’s first emperor, Caesar Augustus, ended
200 years of civil war and began to replace rundown neighborhoods with
monuments, temples, arenas, and government complexes. According to
Roman historian Pliny the Elder, they were “the most beautiful
buildings the world has ever seen.”

Yet even with her beauty, the Eternal City and its empire had a
history of brutality that continued until Rome fell. Thousands of
slaves, foreigners, revolutionaries, and army deserters were crucified
on roadside poles as a warning to anyone who dared to defy the power
of Rome.

What irony that Jesus’s death on a Roman cross turned out to reveal an
eternal glory that made the pride of Rome look like the momentary
beauty of a sunset!

Who could have imagined that in the public curse and agony of the
cross we would find the eternal glory of the love, presence, and
kingdom of our God?

Who could have foreseen that all heaven and earth would one day sing,
“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and
wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!” (Rev. 5:12).
