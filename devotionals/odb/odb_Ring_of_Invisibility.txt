Ring of Invisibility

Everyone who does evil hates the light.
John 3:20

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 3:16–21

The Greek philosopher Plato (c. 427–c. 348 bc) found an imaginative
way of shining light on the dark side of the human heart. He told the
story of a shepherd who innocently discovered a golden ring that had
been hidden deep in the earth. One day a great earthquake opened up an
ancient mountainside tomb and revealed the ring to the shepherd. By
accident he also discovered that the ring had the magical ability to
enable the wearer to become invisible at will. Thinking about
invisibility, Plato raised this question: If people didn’t have to
worry about being caught and punished, would they resist doing wrong?

In John’s gospel we find Jesus taking this idea in a different
direction. There, Jesus, known as the Good Shepherd, speaks of hearts
that stay in the cover of darkness to hide what they are doing (John
3:19–20). He isn’t calling attention to our desire for cover-up to
condemn us, but to offer us salvation through Him (v. 17). As the
Shepherd of our hearts, He brings the worst of our human nature to
light to show us how much God loves us (v. 16).

God in His mercy calls us out of our darkness and invites us to follow
Him in the light.

Reflect & Pray

Dear heavenly Father, thank You for the light of Your presence in my
life. May I walk obediently in the light of Your truth in all that I
do this day.

Sin’s darkness retreats when Christ’s light is revealed.
