Image Conscious

We all . . . are being transformed . . . by the Spirit of the Lord. —
2 Corinthians 3:18

Today's Scripture: 2 Corinthians 3:1-3, 17-18

When going through old family photos, my cousins and I joke about
which physical characteristics we’ve inherited. We notice primarily
the negative ones: short legs, crooked teeth, unruly cowlicks. All of
us can easily identify in our ancestors our own least favorite body
part. In addition to physical attributes, we also inherited character
traits—some good, some not so good. But we don’t always pay as much
attention to those.

According to my unscientific observations, people try all kinds of
methods to overcome physical imperfections—exercise routines, weight-
loss programs, makeup, hair coloring, cosmetic surgery. But instead of
trying to overcome our character flaws, we tend to use them as an
excuse for behaving badly. I suppose this is because changing our
looks is easier than changing our character. But imagine how much
better off we’d be if we put our energy into character development.

As God’s children, we’re not limited by our genetic makeup. We can
surrender our flaws to Him and allow Him to fulfill the potential He
had in mind when He created us as unique expressions of His love. The
power of God’s Spirit and the life of God’s Son are at work in us,
conforming us to His image (2 Cor. 3:18).

Reflect & Pray

I know, Lord, that You’re more interested in the condition of my heart
than my outward appearance. Please make me into the person You want me
to be— filled with kindness, patience, integrity, and love.

The Spirit develops in us the clear image of Christ.
