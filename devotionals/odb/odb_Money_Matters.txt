Money Matters

No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and
love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the
other. —
Luke 16:13

Today's Scripture: Luke 16:1-13

Godfrey Davis, who wrote a biography of the Duke of Wellington, said,
“I found an old account ledger that showed how the Duke spent his
money. It was a far better clue to what he thought was really
important than the reading of his letters or speeches.”

How we handle money reveals much about our priorities. That’s why
Jesus often talked about money. One-sixth of the Gospels’ content,
including one out of every three parables, touches on stewardship.
Jesus wasn’t a fundraiser. He dealt with money matters because money
matters. For some of us, though, it matters too much.

Jesus warned that we can become slaves to money. We may not think that
money means more to us than God does. But Jesus did not say we must
serve God more than we serve money. The issue isn’t what occupies
first place in our life, but whether we serve money at all. Pastor and
author George Buttrick said, “Of all the masters the soul can choose,
there are at last only two—God and money. All choices, however small,
however the alternatives may be disguised, are but variants of this
choice.”

Reflect & Pray

If we pursue mere earthly gain, We choose a path that ends in pain;
But joy and peace are in our soul When we pursue a heavenly goal. —D.
