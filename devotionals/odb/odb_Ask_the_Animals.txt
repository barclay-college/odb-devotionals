Ask the Animals

Ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds in the sky, and
they will tell you.
Job 12:7

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 12:7–10

Our grandkids, enraptured, got a close-up look at a rescued bald
eagle. They were even allowed to touch him. As the zoo volunteer told
about the powerful bird perched on her arm, I was surprised to learn
this male had a wingspan of about six and one-half feet, yet because
of its hollow bones it weighed only about eight pounds.

This reminded me of the majestic eagle I had seen soaring above a
lake, ready to swoop down and snatch its prey in its talons. And I
pictured in my mind another big bird—the spindly legged blue heron I
had spied standing motionless on the edge of a pond. It was poised to
dart its long beak into the water. They’re just two among the nearly
10,000 species of birds that can direct our thoughts to our Creator.

In the book of Job, Job’s friends are debating the reasons for his
suffering and ask, “Can you fathom the mysteries of God?” (see
11:5–9). In response Job declares, “Ask the animals, and they will
teach you, or the birds in the sky, and they will tell you” (Job
12:7). Animals testify to the truth that God designed, cares for, and
controls His creation: “In his hand is the life of every creature and
the breath of all mankind” (v. 10).

Since God cares for birds (Matthew 6:26; 10:29), we can be assured He
loves and cares for you and me, even when we don’t understand our
circumstances. Look around and learn of Him.
