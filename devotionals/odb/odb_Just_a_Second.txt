Just a Second

How fleeting my life is.
Psalm 39:4

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 39:4–6

Scientists are pretty fussy about time. At the end of 2016, the folks
at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland added an extra second to
the year. So if you felt that year dragged on a bit longer than
normal, you were right.

Why did they do that? Because the rotation of the earth slows down
over time, the years get just a tiny bit longer. When scientists track
manmade objects launched into space, they must have accuracy down to
the millisecond. This is “to make sure our collision avoidance
programs are accurate,” according to one scientist.

For most of us, a second gained or lost doesn’t make much difference.
Yet according to Scripture, our time and how we use it is important.
For instance, Paul reminded us in 1 Corinthians 7:29 that “time is
short.” The time we have to do God’s work is limited, so we must use
it wisely. He urged us to “[make] the best use of the time, because
the days are evil” (Ephesians 5:16 esv ).

This doesn’t mean we have to count each second as do the scientists,
but when we consider the fleeting nature of life (Psalm 39:4), we can
be reminded of the importance of using our time wisely.
