Every Moment Matters

For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
Philippians 1:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 1:12–24

When I met Ada, she had outlived her entire group of friends and
family and was living in a nursing home. “It’s the hardest part of
getting old,” she told me, “watching everyone else move on and leave
you behind.” One day I asked Ada what kept her interest and how she
spent her time. She answered me with a Scripture passage from the
apostle Paul (Philippians 1:21): “For to me, to live is Christ and to
die is gain.” Then she said, “While I’m still around, I have work to
do. On my good days, I get to talk to the people here about Jesus; on
the hard days, I can still pray.”

Significantly, Paul wrote Philippians while in prison. And he
acknowledged a reality many Christians understand as they face their
mortality: Even though heaven seems so inviting, the time we have left
on Earth matters to God.

Like Paul, Ada recognized that every breath she took was an
opportunity to serve and glorify God. So Ada spent her days loving
others and introducing them to her Savior.

Even in our darkest moments, Christians can hold on to the promise of
permanent joy in the company of God. And while we live, we enjoy
relationship with Him. He fills all our moments with significance.
