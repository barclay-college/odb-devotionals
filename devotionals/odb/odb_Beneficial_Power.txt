Beneficial Power

The eyes of the Lord run to and fro . . . , to show Himself strong on
behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him. —
2 Chronicles 16:9

Today's Scripture: 2 Chronicles 16:6-13

Boxing and strong-man competitions have a unique aspect to them. In
the events, the athletes compete individually for the purpose of
demonstrating their superior strength. It’s like arm wrestling—you do
it to prove that you are the strongest person in the room.

One aspect of God’s glory is His almighty power. But how does He show
His strength? He doesn’t do it by rearranging the galaxies before our
very eyes, changing the color of the sun at a whim, or freezing a
lightning bolt as a trophy to His strength. Instead, in His love and
compassion for needy people like ourselves, God has chosen to “show
Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him” (2
Chron. 16:9).

The pattern is consistent throughout Scripture. From the dividing of
the Red Sea, to the marvel of manna in the wilderness, to the
miraculous virgin birth, and ultimately to the power of the
resurrection, our Almighty God has chosen to demonstrate His strength
to bless, preserve, and protect His people.

Be assured that He delights in showing Himself strong in the
challenges of our life. And when He proves His power on our behalf,
let’s remember to give Him the glory!

Reflect & Pray

Lord, thank You for choosing to expend Your divine power on the needs
of my life. When my strength is weak, teach me to trust that Your
mighty arm is able to guard, protect, and deliver!

All of God’s promises are backed by His wisdom, love, and power.
