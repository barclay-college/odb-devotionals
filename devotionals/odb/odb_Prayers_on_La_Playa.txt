Prayers on La Playa

Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted.
Psalm 148:13

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 148

During a trip to celebrate our twenty-fifth anniversary, my husband
and I read our Bibles on the beach. As vendors passed and called out
the prices of their wares, we thanked each one but didn’t buy
anything. One vendor, Fernando, smiled wide at my rejection and
insisted we consider buying gifts for friends. After I declined his
invitation, Fernando packed up and began walking away . . . still
grinning. “I pray God will bless your day,” I said.

Fernando turned toward me and said, “He has! Jesus changed my life.”
Fernando knelt between our chairs. “I feel His presence here.” He then
shared how God had delivered him from drug and alcohol abuse more
than fourteen years earlier.

My tears flowed as he recited entire poems from the book of Psalms and
prayed for us. Together, we praised God and rejoiced in His presence .
. . on la playa.

Psalm 148 is a prayer of praise. The psalmist encourages all of
creation to “praise the name of the Lord , for at his command
[everything was] created” (v. 5), “for his name alone is exalted; his
splendor is above the earth and the heavens” (v. 13).

Though God invites us to bring our needs before Him and trust He hears
and cares for us, He also delights in prayers of grateful praise
wherever we are. Even on the beach.

Reflect & Pray

What will you praise God for today? How has He inspired you to praise
Him after hearing someone else’s story?

Help me praise You with every breath You’ve given me, God.
