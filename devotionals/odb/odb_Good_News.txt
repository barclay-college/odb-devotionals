Good News!

Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news,
who proclaims peace!
Nahum 1:15

Today's Scripture & Insight: Nahum 1:7–15

World news bombards us from the Internet, television, radio, and
mobile devices. The majority seems to describe what’s wrong—crime,
terrorism, war, and economic problems. Yet there are times when good
news invades the darkest hours of sadness and despair—stories of
unselfish acts, a medical breakthrough, or steps toward peace in war-
scarred places.

The words of two men recorded in the Old Testament of the Bible
brought great hope to people weary of conflict.

While describing God’s coming judgment on a ruthless and powerful
nation, Nahum said, “Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who
brings good news, who proclaims peace!” (Nah. 1:15). That news brought
hope to all those oppressed by cruelty.

A similar phrase occurs in the book of Isaiah: “How beautiful on the
mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim
peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation” (Isa. 52:7).

Nahum and Isaiah’s prophetic words of hope found their ultimate
fulfillment at the first Christmas when the angel told the shepherds,
“Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for
all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to
you; he is the Messiah, the Lord” (Luke 2:10–11).

The most important headline in our lives every day is the very best
news ever spoken—Christ the Savior is born!
