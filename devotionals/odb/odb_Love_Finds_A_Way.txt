Love Finds A Way

Love never fails. —
1 Corinthians 13:8

Today's Scripture: 1 Corinthians 13:4-13

Years ago I saw a cartoon that depicted a sour, disgruntled, elderly
gentleman standing in rumpled pajamas and robe at his apartment door.
He had just secured the door for the night with four locks, two
deadbolts, and a chain latch. Later he noticed a small white envelope
stuck beneath the door. On the envelope was a large sticker in the
shape of a heart. It was a valentine. Love had found a way.

Only love can change a person’s heart. The Russian author Dostoevsky,
in his book The Brothers Karamazov, tells the story of a hardened
cynic, Ivan, and his resistance to the love of God. On one occasion
his brother Alyosha, a man of deep faith who was confounded by his
brother’s resistance, leans over and kisses Ivan. This simple act of
love burned into Ivan’s heart.

Perhaps you have a friend who is resisting God’s love. Show His love
to him or her, just as God showed love to us when He brought salvation
into the world through Jesus. Shower upon others the kind of love
described in 1 Corinthians 13—a love that is patient, kind, humble,
and unselfish.

Authentic love is a gift from God that we can keep on giving.

Reflect & Pray

Teach me to love as Thou dost love, And let the whole world know That
Jesus Christ lives in my heart, His glorious light to show. —Brandt

God pours His love into our hearts to flow out to others.
