A Missing Sheep

We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. —
Psalm 100:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Luke 15:1-10

Laura loaded a borrowed goat and sheep into a trailer to transport
them to church for a rehearsal of a live nativity. The animals head-
butted and chased each other for a bit and then settled down. Laura
started for the church but first had to stop for gas.

While pumping the gas, she noticed the goat standing in the parking
lot! And the sheep was gone! In the commotion of getting them settled
she had forgotten to lock one of the latches. Laura called the sheriff
and some friends who searched frantically along a stretch of
businesses, cornfields, and woods during the last daylight hours. Many
were praying that she would find the borrowed animal.

The next morning Laura and a friend went out to post “Lost Sheep”
flyers at local businesses. Their first stop was the gas station. A
customer overheard them asking the cashier about posting a flyer and
said, “I think I know where your sheep is!” The sheep had wandered to
his neighbor’s farm, where he had put it in the barn for the night.

The Lord cares about lost sheep—including you and me. Jesus came from
heaven to earth to show us His love and provide salvation (John 3:16).
He goes to great lengths to seek and find us (Luke 19:10).

When the sheep was found, Laura nicknamed her Miracle. And God’s
salvation of us is a miracle of His grace.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, as we care for the things dear to us, how much more
do You care for us, Your children! Thank You for answered prayer and
for the miracle of Your grace.

The Good Shepherd gives His life for His sheep. John 10:11
