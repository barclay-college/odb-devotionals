The Rugged Road

Ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for
your souls.
Jeremiah 6:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 25:4-11

A fishing buddy of mine told me about an alpine lake located high on
the north flank of Jughandle Mountain here in Idaho. Rumor had it that
large cutthroat trout lurked up there. My friend got a pencil and
scrap of napkin and drew a map for me. Several weeks later I gassed up
my truck and set out to follow his directions.

His map put me on one of the worst roads I’ve ever driven! It was an
old logging road that had been bulldozed through the forest and never
regraded. Washouts, fallen timber, deep ruts, and large rocks battered
my spine and bent the undercarriage of my truck. It took half a
morning to reach my destination, and when I finally arrived I asked
myself, “Why would a friend send me up a road like this?”

But the lake was magnificent and the fish were indeed large and
scrappy! My friend had put me on the right road—one I would have
chosen myself and patiently endured had I known what I knew at the
end.

There is a faithful saying: “All the ways of the Lord are loving and
faithful toward those who keep the demands of his covenant” (Ps.
25:10). Some of God’s paths for us are rough and rugged, others
tedious and boring, but all are filled with His love and faithfulness.
When we come to the end of our journey and know what we then will
know, we will say, “God’s path was best for me.”

Reflect & Pray

Father, we don’t see the end of the road, but You do. We trust You for
what we can’t see. We know that You are bringing us through it.

Our path may have obstacles, but God will lead us.
