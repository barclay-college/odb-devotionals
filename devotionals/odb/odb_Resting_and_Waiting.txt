Resting and Waiting

“My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to
finish his work.”
John 4:34

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 4:4-14

It was high noon. Jesus, foot-weary from His long journey, was resting
beside Jacob’s well. His disciples had gone into the city of Sychar to
buy bread. A woman came out of the city to draw water . . . and found
her Messiah. The account tells us that she quickly went into the city
and invited others to come hear “a man who told me everything I ever
did” (John 4:29).

The disciples came back bringing bread. When they urged Jesus to eat,
He said to them, “My food . . . is to do the will of him who sent me
and to finish his work” (v. 34).

Now I ask you: What work had Jesus been doing? He’d been resting and
waiting by the well.

I find great encouragement in this story for I am living with physical
limitations. This passage tells me that I do not have to scurry
about—worrying myself about doing the will of my Father and getting
His work done. In this season of life, I can rest and wait for Him to
bring His work to me.

Similarly, your tiny apartment, your work cubicle, your prison cell,
or your hospital bed can become a “Jacob’s well,” a place to rest and
to wait for your Father to bring His work to you. I wonder who He’ll
bring to you today?
