Always On Duty

Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out
for your souls, as those who must give account. —
Hebrews 13:17

Today's Scripture: Acts 20:22-32

As my kids were discarding their trash at the local mall food court,
my oldest son was almost run into by a man who was clearly on a
mission. My younger son jokingly remarked, “Maybe he stole something.”
Thinking I might be able to use this as a teachable moment, I said,
“That’s what the Bible calls judging.” He then asked with a smile:
“Why are you always ‘pastoring’ me?” After I finished laughing, I told
my sons that I could never take a vacation from shepherding them.

The apostle Paul told the Ephesian elders that they too could never
take a vacation from shepherding God’s people (Acts 20). He was
convinced that false teachers would try to ravage the church (v.29),
and the elders needed to protect the group from them. Caring for God’s
people includes feeding them spiritually, leading them gently, and
warning them firmly. Leaders in the church are to be motivated by the
incalculable price Christ paid on the cross (v.28).

Church leaders have a big responsibility to watch over our souls, for
one day they will give an account to the Lord for their work among us.
Let’s bring them joy now by responding to their faithful, godly
leadership with obedience and submission (Heb. 13:17).
