Arrogance And Pride

Pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverse mouth I hate. —
Proverbs 8:13

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 8:12-21

In The Screwtape Letters written by C.S. Lewis, a senior devil urges
his young protégé to divert a Christian’s thoughts away from God and
focus instead on the faults of the people around him at church.

During a Sunday service, I found myself distracted and somewhat
annoyed by a person near me who sang loudly off key and was out of
sync during the unison readings. But when we bowed our heads for a
time of silent prayer, it struck me that the Lord must surely be more
pleased with that other person’s heart than with the judgmental
feelings He saw in mine.

A few days later I happened to read Proverbs 8 and was struck by verse
13: “Pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverse mouth I
hate.” Throughout this chapter, wisdom calls to us to gain an
understanding heart (v.5) and to find life and obtain favor from the
Lord (v.35). The alternative is to go through life with a superior
attitude while dying inside in the process (v.36).

Pride is a sword that wounds the person who uses it along with those
against whom it is used. Arrogance robs us of all God longs to give
us, but “by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and
life” (22:4).

Reflect & Pray

Oh, just a bit of Thy meekness, my Savior, To be the least when of
self I would boast; Finding my glory and strength in Thy favor, Know
in my weakness Thy grace can do most. —Bosch

Pride brings shame. Humility brings wisdom.
