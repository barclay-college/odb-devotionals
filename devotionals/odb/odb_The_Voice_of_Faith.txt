The Voice of Faith

Though the fig tree does not bud . . . yet I will rejoice in the Lord.
Habakkuk 3:17-18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Habakkuk 3:16-19

The news was numbing. The tears came so quickly that she couldn’t
fight them. Her mind raced with questions, and fear threatened to
overwhelm her. Life had been going along so well, when it was abruptly
interrupted and forever changed without warning.

Tragedy can come in many forms—the loss of a loved one, an illness,
the loss of wealth or our livelihood. And it can happen to anyone at
any time.

Although the prophet Habakkuk knew that tragedy was coming, it still
struck fear in his heart. As he waited for the day when Babylon would
invade the kingdom of Judah, his heart pounded, his lips quivered, and
his legs trembled (Hab. 3:16).

Fear is a legitimate emotion in the face of tragedy, but it doesn’t
have to immobilize us. When we don’t understand the trials we are
going through, we can recount how God has worked in history (vv.
3-15). That’s what Habakkuk did. It didn’t dispel his fear, but it
gave him the courage to move on by choosing to praise the Lord (v.
18).

Our God who has proven Himself faithful throughout the years is always
with us. Because His character doesn’t change, in our fear we can say
with a confident voice of faith, “The Sovereign Lord is my strength!”
(v. 19).

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, when my world is turned upside down, help me to trust You.
You have always been faithful to me.

We can learn the lesson of trust in the school of trial.
