Our Strength And Song

The Lord shall reign forever and ever. —
Exodus 15:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 15:1–2,13–18

Often called “The March King,” composer and band director John Philip
Sousa created music that has been played by bands around the world for
more than a hundred years. As Loras John Schissel, music historian and
conductor of the Virginia Grand Military Band, said, “Sousa is to
marches what Beethoven is to symphonies.” Sousa understood the power
of music to motivate, encourage, and inspire people.

In Old Testament times, the people of Israel were often inspired to
compose and sing songs to celebrate God’s help during times of need.
When the Lord saved His people from certain destruction by Pharaoh’s
army, “Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord . .
. ‘I will sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously! The horse
and its rider He has thrown into the sea! The Lord is my strength and
song, and He has become my salvation’ ” (Ex. 15:1-2).

Music has the power to lift our spirits by reminding us of God’s
faithfulness in the past. When we’re discouraged, we can sing songs
and hymns that raise our eyes from the challenging circumstances we
face to see the power and presence of the Lord. We are reminded that
He is our strength, our song, and our salvation.

Reflect & Pray

Trust in Him, ye saints, forever— He is faithful, changing never;
Neither force nor guile can sever Those He loves from Him. —Kelly

Songs of praise raise our eyes to see God’s faithfulness.
