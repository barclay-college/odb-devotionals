Star Shepherd

Why do you say, . . . “My way is hidden from the Lord”? —
Isaiah 40:27

Today's Scripture: Ezekiel 34:11-16

In the spring, shepherds in Idaho move their flocks from the lowlands
into the mountains. Thousands of sheep move up the passes into the
high country to summer pasture.

My wife and I came across a flock on Shaw Mountain last week. It was
bedded down in a meadow by a quiet stream—a picturesque scene that
evoked memories of Psalm 23.

But where was the shepherd? The sheep appeared to be alone—until a few
broke away from the flock and began to wander toward a distant gully.
Then we heard a shrill whistle from above. Looking up, we saw the
shepherd sitting high on a hill above the sheep, keeping watch over
his flock. A mountain dog and two Border collies stood at his side.
The dogs, responding to the shepherd’s signal, bounded down the hill
and herded the drifting sheep back to the flock where they belonged.

In the same way, the Good Shepherd is watching over you. Even though
you cannot see Him, He can see you! He knows you by name and knows all
about you. You are the sheep of His pasture (Ezek. 34:31). God
promises that He will “seek out” His sheep, “feed them in good
pasture,” and “bind up the broken” (vv.12,14,16).

You can trust in God’s watchful care.
