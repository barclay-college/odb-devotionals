Never Forsaken

Jesus cried out in a loud voice, . . . “My God, my God, why have you
forsaken me?”
Matthew 27:46

Today's Scripture & Insight: Psalm 22:1-10

Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky said, “The degree of civilization in
a society can be judged by entering its prisons.” With that in mind, I
read an online article describing “The Top 8 Deadliest Prisons in the
World.” In one of these prisons every prisoner is held in solitary
confinement.

We are intended to live and relate in relationships and community, not
in isolation. This is what makes solitary confinement such a harsh
punishment.

Isolation is the agony Christ suffered when His eternal relationship
with the Father was broken on the cross. We hear this in His cry
captured in Matthew 27:46: “About three in the afternoon Jesus cried
out in a loud voice, ‘Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?’ (which means, ‘My
God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’).” As He suffered and died
under the burden of our sins, Christ was suddenly alone, forsaken,
isolated, cut off from His relationship with the Father. Yet His
suffering in isolation secured for us the promise of the Father:
“Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you” (Heb. 13:5).

Christ endured the agony and abandonment of the cross for us so that
we would never be alone or abandoned by our God. Ever.

Reflect & Pray

Father, thank You for making it possible for me to be Your child. I
will be eternally grateful for the price Jesus paid to make that
relationship possible. Thank You for the promise that You will never
abandon me.

Those who know Jesus are never alone.
