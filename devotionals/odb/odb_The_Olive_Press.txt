The Olive Press

They went to a place called Gethsemane.
Mark 14:32

Today's Scripture & Insight: Mark 14:32-39

If you visit the village of Capernaum beside the Sea of Galilee, you
will find an exhibit of ancient olive presses. Formed from basalt
rock, the olive press consists of two parts: a base and a grinding
wheel. The base is large, round, and has a trough carved out of it.
The olives were placed in this trough, and then the wheel, also made
from heavy stone, was rolled over the olives to extract the oil.

On the night before His death, Jesus went to the Mount of Olives
overlooking the city of Jerusalem. There, in the garden called
Gethsemane, He prayed to the Father, knowing what lay ahead of Him.

The word Gethsemane means “place of the olive press”—and that
perfectly describes those first crushing hours of Christ’s suffering
on our behalf. There, “in anguish, he prayed . . . and his sweat was
like drops of blood falling to the ground” (Luke 22:44).

Jesus the Son suffered and died to take away “the sin of the world”
(John 1:29) and restore our broken relationship with God the Father.
“Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering . . . . He was
pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, the
punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are
healed” (Isa. 53:4-5).

Our hearts cry out in worship and gratitude.

Reflect & Pray

Father, help me understand what Your Son endured for me. Help me
appreciate the depths of love that would allow my Lord and Christ to
be crushed for my wrongs and my rescue.

Gone my transgressions, and now I am free—all because Jesus was
wounded for me. W. G. Ovens
