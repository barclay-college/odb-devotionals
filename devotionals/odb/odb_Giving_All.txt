Giving All

Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which
is your reasonable service. —
Romans 12:1

Today's Scripture & Insight: Romans 12:1-8

During his only inaugural address as the US President, John F. Kennedy
issued this challenge to Americans: “Ask not what your country can do
for you; ask what you can do for your country.” It was a renewed call
for citizens to surrender their lives in sacrifice and service to
others. His words especially inspired the sons and daughters of men
and women who had served their country in war.

His meaning was clear: What their parents purchased, often with their
very lives, must now be protected by peaceful means. An army of
volunteers arose to answer that call, and through the decades they
have accomplished an immeasurable amount of humanitarian work around
the globe.

Centuries earlier, the apostle Paul issued a similar call to
Christians in the opening verses of Romans 12. Here he urges us to
give our bodies as “living sacrifices” in service to the One who paid
with His life for our sins. This spiritual sacrifice must be more than
mere words; it must be an investment of our lives in the physical,
emotional, and spiritual well-being of others.

Best of all, our serving can be done right where we are.

Reflect & Pray

Father, show me this day the many ways my life can be surrendered to
You, and then give me the strength to begin to act.

Don’t always ask Jesus what He can do for you; ask Jesus what you can
do for Him.
