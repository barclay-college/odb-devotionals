Leading with Love

I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love.
Philemon 9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philemon 8–18

In his book Spiritual Leadership, J. Oswald Sanders explores the
qualities and the importance of tact and diplomacy. “Combining these
two words,” Sanders says, “the idea emerges of skill in reconciling
opposing viewpoints without giving offense and without compromising
principle.”

During Paul’s imprisonment in Rome, he became the spiritual mentor and
close friend of a runaway slave named Onesimus, whose owner was
Philemon. When Paul wrote to Philemon, a leader of the church in
Colossae, asking him to receive Onesimus as a brother in Christ, he
exemplified tact and diplomacy. “Although in Christ I could be bold
and order you to do what you ought to do, yet I prefer to appeal to
you on the basis of love. . . . [Onesimus] is very dear to me but even
dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord” 
(Philem. 8–9, 16).

Paul, a respected leader of the early church, often gave clear
commands to the followers of Jesus. In this case, though, he appealed
to Philemon on the basis of equality, friendship, and love. “I did not
want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do
would not seem forced but would be voluntary” (v. 14).

In all our relationships, may we seek to preserve harmony and
principle in the spirit of love.
