Promises Still Kept

When the sun went down . . . there appeared a smoking oven and a
burning torch that passed between those pieces. —
Genesis 15:17

Today's Scripture: Genesis 15:5-21

In the ancient Near East a treaty between a superior (a lord or king)
and an inferior (his subjects) was called a suzerain treaty. The
ratification ceremony required animals to be sacrificed and cut in
half. The animal parts were then arranged in two rows on the ground,
forming an aisle between them. As the suzerain walked between the
halves, he was publicly declaring he would keep the covenant and would
become like the slain animals if he failed to keep his word.

When Abram asked God how he could be sure His promises would come to
pass, God used the culturally significant symbolism of the suzerain
treaty to affirm His promises (Gen. 15). When the burning torch passed
through the pieces of the sacrifice, Abram understood that God was
declaring it was His job to keep the covenant.

God’s covenant with Abram and His assurance of its completion extends
to followers of Christ. That is why Paul repeatedly refers to
believers as sons of Abraham in his New Testament writings (Rom.
4:11-18; Gal. 3:29). Once we accept Jesus Christ as Savior, God
becomes the keeper in our covenant of faith (see John 10:28-29).

Because God is the keeper of our salvation, with renewed confidence in
Him we trust Him with our lives.

Reflect & Pray

He will never fail us, He will not forsake; His eternal covenant He
will never break. Onward then, and fear not, children of the day; For
His Word shall never, never pass away. —Havergal

Our salvation is secure because God does the holding.
