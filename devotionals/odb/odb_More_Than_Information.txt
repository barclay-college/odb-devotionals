More Than Information

Abide in Me, and I in you. —
John 15:4

Today's Scripture: John 15:1-13

How is behavior altered? In his book The Social Animal, David Brooks
notes that some experts have said people just need to be taught the
long-term risks of bad behavior. For example, he writes: “Smoking can
lead to cancer. Adultery destroys families, and lying destroys trust.
The assumption was that once you reminded people of the foolishness of
their behavior, they would be motivated to stop. Both reason and will
are obviously important in making moral decisions and exercising self-
control. But neither of these character models has proven very
effective.” In other words, information alone is not powerful enough
to transform behavior.

As Jesus’ followers, we want to grow and change spiritually. More than
two millennia ago, Jesus told His disciples how that can happen. He
said, “Abide in Me, and I in you. As a branch cannot bear fruit of
itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you
abide in Me” (John 15:4). Jesus is the Vine and we, His followers, are
the branches. If we’re honest, we know we’re utterly helpless and
spiritually ineffective apart from Him.

Jesus transforms us spiritually and reproduces His life in us—as we
abide in Him.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, take my life and make it wholly Thine; Fill my poor heart with
Thy great love divine. Take all my will, my passion, self, and pride;
I now surrender, Lord—in me abide. —Orr

A change in behavior begins with Jesus changing our heart.
