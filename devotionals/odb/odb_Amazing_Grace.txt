Amazing Grace

For by grace you have been saved through faith. —
Ephesians 2:8

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 2:1-10

Pressed into service in the Royal Navy, John Newton was dismissed for
insubordination and turned to a career trafficking in slaves.
Notorious for cursing and blasphemy, Newton served on a slave ship
during the cruelest days of trans-Atlantic slavery, finally working
his way up to captain.

A dramatic conversion on the high seas set him on the path to grace.
He always felt a sense of undeservedness for his new life. He became a
rousing evangelical preacher and eventually a leader in the
abolitionist movement. Newton appeared before Parliament, giving
irrefutable eyewitness testimony to the horror and immorality of the
slave trade. We also know him as the author of the lyrics of perhaps
the best-loved hymn of all time, “Amazing Grace.”

Newton described any good in himself as an outworking of God’s grace.
In doing so, he stands with these great heroes—a murderer and
adulterer (King David), a coward (the apostle Peter), and a persecutor
of Christians (the apostle Paul).

This same grace is available to all who call upon God, for “in Him we
have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according
to the riches of His grace” (Eph. 1:7).

Reflect & Pray

Amazing grace—how sweet the sound— That saved a wretch like me! I once
was lost but now am found, Was blind but now I see. —Newton

Lives rooted in God’s unchanging grace can never be uprooted.
