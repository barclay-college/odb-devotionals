Safety Net

Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Matthew 5:48

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 5:43–48

For years I thought of the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5–7) as a
blueprint for human behavior, a standard no one could possibly meet.
How could I have missed the true meaning? Jesus spoke these words not
to frustrate us, but to tell us what God is like.

Why should we love our enemies? Because our merciful Father causes His
sun to rise on the evil and the good. Why store up treasures in
heaven? Because the Father lives there and will lavishly reward us.
Why live without fear and worry? Because the same God who clothes the
lilies and the grass of the field has promised to take care of us. Why
pray? If an earthly father gives his son bread or fish, how much more
will the Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask?

Jesus gave the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5–7) not only to explain
God’s ideal toward which we should never stop striving but also to
show that in this life none of us will ever reach that ideal.

Before God, we all stand on level ground: murderers and tantrum-
throwers, adulterers and lusters, thieves and coveters. We are all
desperate, and that is the only state appropriate to a human being who
wants to know God. Having fallen from the absolute ideal, we have
nowhere to land but in the safety net of absolute grace.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, I am a sinner and I need Your forgiveness. I believe that
You died on the cross to pay the penalty for my sin. You did what I
could not do for myself, and in humility I accept Your gift of grace.
Help me to live a life that is pleasing to You.

Only God can transform a sinful soul into a masterpiece of grace.
