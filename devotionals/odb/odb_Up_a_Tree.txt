Up a Tree

In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.
Jonah 2:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jonah 2:1–10

My mother discovered my kitten Velvet atop the kitchen counter,
devouring homemade bread. With a huff of frustration, she scooted her
out the door. Hours later, we searched our yard for the missing cat
without success. A faint meow whistled on the wind, and I looked up to
the peak of a poplar tree where a black smudge tilted a branch.

In her haste to flee my mother’s frustration over her behavior, Velvet
chose a more precarious predicament. Is it possible that we sometimes
do something similar—running from our errors and putting ourselves in
danger? And even then God comes to our rescue.

The prophet Jonah fled in disobedience from God’s call to preach to
Nineveh, and was swallowed up by a great fish. “From inside the fish
Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. He said: ‘In my distress I called to
the Lord , and he answered me’ ” (Jonah 2:1–2). God heard Jonah’s plea
and, “commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land” (v. 10).
Then God gave Jonah another chance (3:1).

After exhausting our efforts to woo Velvet down, we summoned the local
fire department. With the longest ladder fully extended, a kind man
climbed high, plucked my kitten from her perch, and returned to place
her safely in my arms.

Oh the heights—and the depths—God goes to in rescuing us from our
disobedience with His redeeming love!
