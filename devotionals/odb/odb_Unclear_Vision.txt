Unclear Vision

My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.
Job 42:5

Today's Scripture: Job 19:1-21

My friend Meaghan is an accomplished equestrian, and I’ve been
learning some interesting things about horses from her. For instance,
despite having the largest eyes of all land mammals, horses have poor
eyesight and can see fewer colors than humans. Because of this, they
can’t always identify objects on the ground. When they see a pole,
they don’t know if it’s a pole they can easily step over or a large
snake that might harm them. For this reason, until they are properly
trained horses are easily frightened and quick to run away.

We too may want to run from alarming circumstances. We may feel like
Job who misunderstood his troubles and wished he’d never been born.
Since he couldn’t see that it was Satan who was trying to break him
down, he feared that the Lord, in whom he had trusted, was trying to
destroy him. Overwhelmed, he cried out, “God has wronged me and drawn
his net around me” (Job 19:6).

Like Job’s vision, ours is limited. We want to run away from the
difficult situations that scare us. From God’s perspective, we are not
alone. He understands what confuses and frightens us. He knows we are
safe with Him by our side. This is our opportunity to trust His
understanding rather than our own.

Reflect & Pray

In what ways have you doubted God’s goodness? How have you seen Him
working in your life during a difficult time?

Trusting God’s faithfulness dispels our fearfulness.
