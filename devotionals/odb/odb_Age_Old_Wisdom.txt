Age-Old Wisdom

Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring
understanding?
Job 12:12

Today's Scripture & Insight: 1 Kings 12:1–7, 12–17

In 2010, a newspaper in Singapore published a special report that
contained life lessons gleaned from eight senior citizens. It opened
with these words: “While aging brings challenges to mind and body, it
can also lead to an expansion in other realms. There is an abundance
of emotional and social knowledge; qualities which scientists are
beginning to define as wisdom . . . the wisdom of elders.”

Indeed, wise older people have much to teach us about life. But in the
Bible, we meet a newly crowned king who failed to recognize this.

King Solomon had just died, and in 1 Kings 12:3, we read that “the
whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam” with a petition. They asked
the new king to lighten the harsh labor and heavy taxes his father
Solomon had demanded of them. In return, they would loyally serve
Rehoboam.

At first the young king consulted the elders (v. 6). But he rejected
their advice and accepted the foolish counsel of the young men who had
grown up with him (v. 8). He made the burden on the people even
greater! His rashness cost him most of his kingdom.

All of us need the counsel that comes with years of experience,
especially from those who have walked with God and listened well to
His counsel. Think of the accumulated wisdom God has given them! They
have much to share with us about the Lord. Let’s seek them out and
give a listening ear to their wisdom.
