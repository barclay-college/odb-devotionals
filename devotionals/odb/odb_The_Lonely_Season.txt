The Lonely Season

I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my
prayers.
Ephesians 1:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Timothy 4:9-18

Amid the pile of post-Christmas mail I discovered a treasure—a
handmade Christmas card painted on repurposed cardstock. Simple
watercolor strokes evoked a scene of wintry hills livened with
evergreens. Centered at the bottom, framed by red-berried holly, was
this hand-printed message:

Peace be with you!

The artist was a prisoner and a friend of mine. As I admired his
handiwork, I realized I hadn’t written to him in 2 years!

Long ago, another prisoner was neglected as he waited in prison. “Only
Luke is with me,” wrote the apostle Paul to Timothy (2 Tim. 4:11). “No
one came to my support, but everyone deserted me” (v. 16). Yet Paul
found encouragement even in prison, and he wrote, “The Lord stood at
my side and gave me strength” (v. 17). But surely Paul felt the lonely
ache of abandonment.

On the back of that wonderful Christmas card my friend wrote, “May the
peace and joy and hope and love brought about through the birth of
Jesus be with you and yours.” He signed it, “Your brother in Christ.”
I put the card on my wall as a reminder to pray for him. Then I wrote
to him.

Throughout this coming year let’s reach out to the loneliest of our
brothers and sisters.

Reflect & Pray

What lonely people can I think of right now? Newcomers to town?
Prisoners? People in the hospital or in senior living centers? What
can I do, no matter how small, to reach out to them?

Reach out in friendship and encourage the lonely.
