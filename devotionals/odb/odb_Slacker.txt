Slacker?

How long will you slumber, O sluggard? —
Proverbs 6:9

Today's Scripture: Proverbs 6:6-11

While studying the book of Proverbs in my small-group Bible study, our
leader suggested that we change the description of a lazy person from
a sluggard to a slacker (6:6,9). Ah, now he was speaking my lingo. I
immediately started thinking of all the people I consider to be
slackers.

Like the men and women who fail to teach and discipline their
children. Or that guy who refuses to help around the house. Or those
teenagers who neglect their studies and play Internet games day and
night.

If we’re honest, we’re all susceptible to this. What about being a
“prayer slacker” (1 Thess. 5:17-18), or a “Bible-reading slacker” (Ps.
119:103; 2 Tim. 3:16-17), or a “non-exercising-of-our-spiritual-gift
slacker” (Rom. 12:4-8), or a “non-witnessing slacker”? (Matt.
28:19-20; Acts 1:8).

If we are not doing what we know God wants us to do, we are certainly
spiritual slackers. In fact, when we refuse to obey God, we are
sinning.

Listen to these challenging and convicting words from the book of
James: “It is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it”
(4:17 NLT). Let’s not be spiritual slackers.

Reflect & Pray

When we know what God wants us to do, But then we refuse to obey,
We’re ignoring the voice of the Lord, And sinfully choosing our way.
—Sper

We may make excuses for not obeying God, but He still calls it
disobedience.
