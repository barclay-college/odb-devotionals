Anywhere

I remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and
followed me through the wilderness.
Jeremiah 2:2

Today's Scripture & Insight: Jeremiah 2:1–8; 3:14–15

As I flipped through a box of my old wedding photographs, my fingers
stopped at a picture of my husband and me, newly christened “Mr. and
Mrs.” My dedication to him was obvious in my expression. I would
go anywhere with him.

Nearly four decades later, our marriage is tightly threaded with love
and a commitment that has carried us through both hard and good times.
Year after year, I’ve recommitted my dedication to go anywhere with
him.

In Jeremiah 2:2, God yearns for His beloved but wayward Israel, “I
remember the devotion of your youth, how as a bride you loved me and
followed me.” The Hebrew word for devotion conveys the highest loyalty
and commitment possible. At first, Israel expressed this unwavering
devotion to God, but gradually she turned away.

Despite the undeniably powerful feelings in the early stages of
commitment, complacency can dull the sharp edge of love and a lack of
zeal can lead to unfaithfulness. We know the importance of fighting
against such a lag in our marriages. What about the fervor of our love
relationship with God? Are we as devoted to Him now as we were when we
first came to faith?

God faithfully allows His people to return (3:14–15). Today we can
renew our vows to follow Him—anywhere.

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, help me to keep the promises I’ve made to You. I will follow
You anywhere.

You don’t need to know where you’re going if you know God is leading.
