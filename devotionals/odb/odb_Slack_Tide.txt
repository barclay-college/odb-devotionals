Slack Tide

He said to them, “Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and
rest a while.” —
Mark 6:31

Today's Scripture: Mark 6:30-32

I find it fascinating to consider the pull of the moon on our great
oceans, which creates high and low tides. At the changing of the tide,
there is a brief period of time called “slack tide” when the water is
neither high nor low. According to scientists, this is when the water
is “unstressed.” It is a quiet pause before the surging of tidal flow
begins again.

Sometimes in our busy schedules we may feel pulled in different
directions by competing responsibilities. In Jesus’ ministry, we see
how He understood the demands made on His followers and the need for
rest. Returning from a traveling ministry in teams of two, the Twelve
reported the wonderful things that God had done through them (Mark
6:7-13,30). But Jesus responded: “‘Come aside by yourselves to a
deserted place and rest a while.’ For there were many coming and
going, and they did not even have time to eat. So they departed to a
deserted place in the boat by themselves” (vv.31-32).

What responsibilities are pulling on you today? It is certainly
acceptable to plan some rest and relaxation time to rejuvenate your
body and soul for more fruitful service to others. Jesus advised it,
and we all need it. He will meet you there.

Reflect & Pray

My Shepherd is the Lord Who knows my needs, and I am blest; By quiet
streams, in pastures green, He leads and makes me rest. —Psalter

Spending quiet time with God can bring quiet rest from God.
