Pulling Together

Let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good
deeds.
Hebrews 10:24

Today's Scripture & Insight: Hebrews 10:19–25

Why do more than five million people a year pay money to run several
miles over an obstacle course where they must ascend vertical walls,
slog through mud, and climb up inside a vertical pipe with water
pouring down on them? Some see it as a personal challenge to push
their limit of endurance or conquer their fears. For others, the
attraction is teamwork where competitors help and support each other.
One person called it “a no-judgment zone” where people who are
strangers will reach out to help each other finish the race (Stephanie
Kanowitz, The Washington Post).

The Bible urges us to pursue teamwork as a model of living out our
faith in Jesus. “Let us consider how we may spur one another on toward
love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in
the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as
you see the Day approaching” (Hebrews 10:24–25).

Our goal is not to “finish first” in the race of faith, but to reach
out in tangible ways of encouragement by setting an example and
lending a helping hand along the way.

The day will come when we complete our life on earth. Until then,
let’s spur each other on, be ready to help, and keep pulling together
every day.

Reflect & Pray

Father in heaven, give us eyes to see and strength to help each other
in the race of faith today.

We run together in the race of faith.
