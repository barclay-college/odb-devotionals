Beautiful Unity

Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of
peace.
Ephesians 4:3

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ephesians 4:1–6

Seeing three large predatory animals cuddle and play together is
extremely unusual. Yet this is precisely what happens daily in an
animal sanctuary in Georgia. In 2001, after months of neglect and
abuse, a lion, a Bengal tiger, and a black bear were rescued by Noah’s
Ark Animal Sanctuary. “We could have separated them,” said the
assistant director. “But since they came as a kind of family, we
decided to keep them together.” The trio had found comfort in each
other during their time of mistreatment, and, despite their
differences, they live peacefully together.

Unity is a beautiful thing. But the unity Paul wrote about in his
letter to the believers in Ephesus is unique. Paul encouraged the
Ephesians to live up to their calling as members of one body in Christ
(Eph. 4:4–5). By the power of the Holy Spirit they would be able to
live in unity as they developed humility, gentleness, and patience.
These attitudes also allow us to lovingly bear “with one another in
love” through the common ground we have in Christ Jesus (4:2).

Despite our differences, as members of the family of God we have been
reconciled to Him through the death of our Savior and reconciled to
each other through the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

Reflect & Pray

Heavenly Father, help me to grow in gentleness and patience toward
others. Show me how to love others, even when we may have differences.

We keep unity by being united in the Spirit.
