The Lord Rejoices

[God] will rejoice over you with singing.
Zephaniah 3:17

Today's Scripture & Insight: Zephaniah 3:14–20

My grandmother recently sent me a folder full of old photographs, and
as I thumbed through them, one caught my eye. In it, I’m two years
old, and I’m sitting on one end of a hearth in front of a fireplace.
On the other end, my dad has his arm around my mom’s shoulders. Both
are gazing at me with expressions of love and delight.

I pinned this photo to my dresser, where I see it every morning. It’s
a wonderful reminder of their love for me. The truth is, though, that
even the love of good parents is imperfect. I saved this photo because
it reminds me that although human love may fail sometimes, God’s love
never fails—and according to Scripture, God looks at me the way my
parents are looking at me in this picture.

The prophet Zephaniah described this love in a way that astounds me.
He describes God as rejoicing over His people with singing. God’s
people had not earned this love. They had failed to obey Him or to
treat each other with compassion. But Zephaniah promised that in the
end, God’s love would prevail over their failures. God would take away
their punishment (Zephaniah 3:15), and He would rejoice over them (v.
17). He would gather His people into His arms, bring them home, and
restore them (v. 20).

That’s a love worth reflecting on every morning.
