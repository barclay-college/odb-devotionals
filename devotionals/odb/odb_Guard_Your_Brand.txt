Guard Your Brand

Above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection. —
Colossians 3:14

Today's Scripture: Colossians 3:1-14

A popular clothing retailer requires that its sales clerks dress like
the models in the store windows who advertise its clothes. This
practice is referred to as “guarding their brand.” The idea behind it
is that shoppers will be more likely to purchase clothes because they
will want to look like the people they see wearing them.

In a consumer-oriented culture, it’s easy to be seduced into thinking
that we can “buy” acceptance by wearing the things that beautiful
people wear. Retailers would have us believe that looking good will
make us desirable.

Sometimes we even convince ourselves that we can win followers for God
by making ourselves attractive to the world. But the Bible is clear
about what’s really important to God. He wants us to look like Jesus
in our character. In a sense, Jesus is our “brand,” for we are being
conformed to His image (Rom. 8:29). We attract others to Christ when
we put on His attributes, which include tender mercies, kindness,
humility, meekness, longsuffering (Col. 3:12), and, above all, love
(v.14).

Instead of polishing and protecting our own image, we need to be
guarding and reflecting the image of God, which is being perfected in
us through Christ.

Reflect & Pray

O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer, This is my constant longing and
prayer; Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures, Jesus, Thy
perfect likeness to wear. —Chisholm

One of the Spirit’s roles is to form the likeness of Christ in us.
