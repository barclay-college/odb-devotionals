Fragrant Living

I am full, having received . . . the things sent from you, a sweet-
smelling aroma . . . well pleasing to God. —
Philippians 4:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 4:10-20

I’m grateful that God has given us the sense of smell so we can enjoy
the many fragrances of life. I think of how much I enjoy something as
simple as the fresh and inviting aroma of after-shave lotion in the
morning. Or the mellow smell of fresh-cut grass in the spring. I
especially enjoy sitting in the backyard when the delicate scent of my
favorite roses fills the air. And then there are the savory aromas of
delicious food.

So it catches my attention when the apostle Paul says that our
generous acts of love toward others are like a “sweet-smelling aroma,
an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God” (Phil. 4:18). When we
think of helping those in need, we usually think of it as the right
thing to do—or even the Christlike thing to do. But Paul says that our
intentional act of reaching out to meet someone’s need actually fills
the throne room of God with a fragrance that brings pleasure to Him.

We can please God with the aromas that rise from being a blessing to
others! What an added incentive this is for us to perform deeds of
kindness in His name.

Who might need your act of kindness today? Ask God to lead you to
someone. Be a blessing. It’s a fragrant thing to do!
