Here to Serve

[Jesus] poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’
feet.
John 13:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 13:3–17

It was time for our church to commission a new group of leaders. To
symbolize their roles as servant-leaders, the church elders
participated in a memorable foot-washing ceremony. Each of the
leaders—including the pastor—washed each other’s feet as the
congregation observed them.

What they did that day was modeled for us by Jesus Christ, as recorded
in John 13. In that incident, which happened at what is called the
Last Supper, Jesus “got up from the meal, . . . poured water into a
basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet” (John 13:4–5). Later, as
Jesus was explaining to His disciples why He had done this, He said,
“No servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater
than the one who sent him” (v. 16). He also said, “I am among you as
one who serves” (Luke 22:27).

If it is not below Jesus’s dignity to do such a lowly task, it is not
below any of us to serve others. What an amazing example He set for
all of us. Indeed, He “did not come to be served, but to serve” (Mark
10:45). He showed us what it means to be a leader and a servant.
That’s Jesus, the One who serves.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me serve others. Guide me to set aside my personal
interests and desires to provide help to those who need it.

No deed is small when done for Christ.
