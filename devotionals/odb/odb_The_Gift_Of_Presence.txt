The Gift Of Presence

Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to
comfort them concerning their brother. —
John 11:19

Today's Scripture: John 11:14-27

A number of years ago, when I was a new human resource manager for a
company, I attended the visitation and funeral of a long-time employee
I had never met. The worker, a bricklayer, was loved by his co-
workers, yet very few came to see his widow. I listened to someone
trying to console her by saying that many people stay away because
they are afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing and making the
family more miserable.

In times of distress, however, people rarely remember what we say.
What they most remember is that we were there. Familiar faces offer
strength beyond description; they provide comfort for the deep
feelings of loneliness setting in from the loss. This “gift of
presence” is one we’re all capable of offering, even if we’re tongue-
tied or uncomfortable.

Martha and Mary were surrounded by friends and mourners who comforted
them when their brother Lazarus died (John 11:19). Then the One they
most longed to see—Jesus—came and wept with them (vv.33-35). The
people responded, “See how He loved him!” (v.36).

In loss of any kind, Jesus always gives His comforting presence, and
we have the ability to give deeply of His compassion simply by the
gift of our presence.

Reflect & Pray

O may I never fail to see The comfort you may need from me; And may
you know that I am there To bind our souls as grief we share. —Kilgore

Often the best comfort is just being there.
