Working For The Wind

What profit has he who has labored for the wind? —
Ecclesiastes 5:16

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ecclesiastes 5:10-17

Howard Levitt lost his $200,000 Ferrari on a flooded Toronto highway.
He had driven into what seemed like a puddle before realizing that the
water was much deeper and rising quickly. When the water reached the
Ferrari’s fenders, its 450-horsepower engine seized. Thankfully he was
able to escape the car and get to high ground.

Howard’s soggy sports car reminds me of Solomon’s observation that
“riches perish through misfortune” (Eccl. 5:14). Natural disasters,
theft, and accidents may claim our dearest belongings. Even if we
manage to protect them, we certainly can’t haul them with us to heaven
(v.15). Solomon asked, “What profit has he who has labored for the
wind?” (v.16). There is futility in working only to acquire belongings
that will ultimately disappear.

There is something that doesn’t spoil and we can “take with us.” It is
possible to store up eternal heavenly treasure. Pursuing virtues such
as generosity (Matt. 19:21), humility (5:3), and spiritual endurance
(Luke 6:22-23) will yield lasting rewards that can’t be destroyed.
Will the kind of treasure you seek expire on earth? Or, are you
seeking “those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the
right hand of God”? (Col. 3:1).

Reflect & Pray

Dear God, please give me a passion for the unseen, eternal rewards
that You offer. Make me indifferent to the temporary pleasures of this
world.

Treasures on earth can’t compare with the treasures in heaven.
