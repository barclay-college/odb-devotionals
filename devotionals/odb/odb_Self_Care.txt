Self-Care

Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.
Mark 6:31

Today's Scripture & Insight: Exodus 18:14-24

After my husband underwent emergency heart surgery, I spent an anxious
night by his hospital bed. Mid-morning, I remembered a scheduled
haircut. “I’ll have to cancel,” I said, raking my fingers distractedly
through my straggly hair.

“Mom, just wash your face and go to your appointment,” my daughter
said.

“No, no,” I insisted. “It doesn’t matter. I need to be here.”

“I’ll stay,” Rosie said. “Self-care, Mom. . . . Self-care. You’re of
more use to Dad if you take care of yourself.”

Moses was wearing himself out serving alone as judge over the
Israelites. Jethro cautioned his son-in-law Moses: “You will only wear
[yourself] out. The work is too heavy . . . you cannot handle it
alone” (Ex. 18:18). He then explained ways that Moses could delegate
his work and share his heavy load with others.

Though it may seem paradoxical for the Christian, self-care is
essential for a healthy life (Matt. 22:37-39; Eph. 5:29-30). Yes, we
must love God first and love others as well, but we also need to get
adequate rest to renew our body and spirit. Sometimes self-care means
stepping away and graciously allowing others to help us with our
burdens.

Jesus often slipped away to rest and pray (Mark 6:30-32). When we
follow His example, we will be more effective in our relationships and
better able to give care to others.
