The Blessed Hope

[We look] for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God
and Savior Jesus Christ. —
Titus 2:13

Today's Scripture: 2 Peter 3:10-18

So many predictions of the end of the world have come and gone. Those
predictions are unsettling and often fill people with fear. Yet the
Bible does refer to a time called “the day of the Lord” when He will
return. It will happen, but only God knows when.

It’s a day that Jesus’ followers can look forward to. In light of that
time to come, the apostle Peter tells us how the believer can live
with a joyful purpose (2 Peter 3:10-18). We can look upward by living
Christ-honoring lives (v.11). We can look inward by making every
effort to be found at peace with God (v.14). And we can look outward
by being on guard so we aren’t carried away by the wrong influence of
others (v.17).

How do we do this? By “grow[ing] in the grace and knowledge of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (v.18). When we grow in character
through His written Word, we begin to relate more closely to Jesus,
the Living Word. The Holy Spirit takes God’s Word and guides us in the
way to live.

The day of the Lord shouldn’t be a fearful day for Jesus’ followers.
Our King will return to make all things right and to rule forever. We
wait for that time with great anticipation. It is our “blessed hope”
(Titus 2:13).
