Tough And Tender

Mark the blameless man, and observe the upright; for the future of
that man is peace. But the transgressors shall be destroyed. —
Psalm 37:37-38

Today's Scripture: Psalm 37:30-40

“Any fool can start a quarrel” (Prov. 20:3). “The name of the wicked
will rot” (10:7). “He who hates correction is stupid” (12:1).

Is it right for God’s Word to call people fools, wicked, and stupid?
Isn’t God all about love and kindness?

Indeed, God is love. God is kindness. He created a world with great
possibilities for joy and contentment.

Yet God reminds us that in His love He does not overlook the
foolishness of our hearts and actions. Those verses from Proverbs can
remind us that while God is love, He has great expectations for us.
Life is tougher than it needs to be for those who bring self-imposed
trouble upon themselves.

Each negative word in those proverbs has a counterpart—an alternative
that gives God’s preferred way to live. A fool quarrels, but the
honorable man avoids strife (20:3). The name of the wicked rots, but
the memory of the righteous is blessed (10:7). The stupid reject
correction, but those who love instruction also love knowledge (12:1).

There’s always a choice in this life. Live God’s way and enjoy His
smile of approval—or live as a fool and find destruction. That’s the
tough and tender truth about living in God’s world. Which do you
choose?
