Beautiful

She has done a beautiful thing to me.
Mark 14:6

Today's Scripture: Luke 7:36–50

Picture two teenage girls. The first girl is strong and healthy. The
other girl has never known the freedom of getting around on her own.
From her wheelchair she faces not only the emotional challenges common
to life, but also a stream of physical pains and struggles.

But both girls are smiling cheerfully as they enjoy each other’s
company. Two beautiful teenagers—each seeing in the other the treasure
of friendship.

Jesus devoted much of His time and attention to people like the girl
in the wheelchair. People with lifelong disabilities or physical
deformities as well as those who were looked down on by others for
various reasons. In fact, Jesus let one of “those people” anoint Him
with oil, to the disdain of the religious leaders (Luke 7:39). On
another occasion, when a woman demonstrated her love with a similar
act, Jesus told her critics, “Leave her alone . . . . She has done a
beautiful thing to me” (Mark 14:6).

God values everyone equally; there are no distinctions in His eyes. In
reality, we are all in desperate need of Christ’s love and
forgiveness. His love compelled Him to die on the cross for us.

May we see each person as Jesus did: made in God’s image and worthy of
His love. Let’s treat everyone we meet with Christlike equality and
learn to see beauty as He does.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Lord, help me to see people as You see them—not important because
of what they can do or how they look, but because they are made in
God’s image and You loved them enough to die for them.

Everyone we meet bears the image of God.
