A Good Inheritance

I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your
grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice.
2 Timothy 1:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: 2 Timothy 1:1–5

Grandpa and Grandma Harris didn’t have a lot of money, yet they
managed to make each Christmas memorable for my cousins and me. There
was always plenty of food, fun, and love. And from an early age we
learned that it was Christ who made this celebration possible.

We want to leave the same legacy to our children. When we got together
last December to share Christmas with family, we realized this
wonderful tradition had started with Grandpa and Grandma. They
couldn’t leave us a monetary inheritance, but they were careful to
plant the seeds of love, respect, and faith so that we—their
children’s children—might imitate their example.

In the Bible we read about grandma Lois and mom Eunice, who shared
with Timothy genuine faith (2 Tim. 1:5). Their influence prepared this
man to share the good news with many others.

We can prepare a spiritual inheritance for those whose lives we
influence by living in close communion with God. In practical ways, we
make His love a reality to others when we give them our undivided
attention, show interest in what they think and do, and share life
with them. We might even invite them to share in our celebrations!
When our lives reflect the reality of God’s love, we leave a lasting
legacy for others.

Reflect & Pray

Father, may I leave a good spiritual inheritance to my family as You
use me to show Your everlasting love.

If someone has left you a godly inheritance, invest it in others.
