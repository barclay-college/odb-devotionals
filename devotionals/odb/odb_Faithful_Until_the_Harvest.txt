Faithful Until the Harvest

Let us not become weary in doing good.
Galatians 6:9

Today's Scripture & Insight: Galatians 6:7–10

A woman I know planned an event at a local park and invited all the
neighborhood children to participate. She was excited about the
opportunity to share her faith with her neighbors.

She recruited her three grandchildren and two high school students to
help her, gave the assignments, planned a number of games and other
activities, prepared food, prepared a Bible story about Jesus to
present to the children, and waited for them to gather.

Not a single child showed up the first day. Or the second day. Or the
third day. Yet, each day my friend went through that day’s activities
with her grandchildren and helpers.

On the fourth day, she noticed a family picnicking nearby and invited
the children to join in the games. One little girl came, entered into
the fun, ate with them, and listened to the story about Jesus. Perhaps
years from now she’ll remember. Who knows what the outcome will be?
God, through the book of Galatians, encourages us, “Let us not become
weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if
we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good
to all people” (6:9–10).

Don’t worry about numbers or other visible measures of success. Our
job is to be faithful to what He wants us to do and then leave the
harvest to Him. God determines the outcomes.

Reflect & Pray

What best-laid plans of yours have gone wrong? How can you learn to
trust God with the outcome despite disappointment?

God, I’m grateful that You’re the one in charge of the results. You’re
the one at work. Help me to do what You ask no matter what.
