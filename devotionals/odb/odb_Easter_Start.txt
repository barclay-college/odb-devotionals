Easter Start

Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and
believe.
John 20:27

Today's Scripture & Insight: John 20:24-31

One detail in the Easter story has always intrigued me. Why did Jesus
keep the scars from His crucifixion? Presumably He could have had any
resurrected body He wanted, and yet He chose one identifiable mainly
by scars that could be seen and touched. Why?

I believe the story of Easter would be incomplete without those scars
on the hands, the feet, and the side of Jesus (John 20:27). Human
beings dream of pearly straight teeth and wrinkle-free skin and ideal
body shapes. We dream of an unnatural state: the perfect body. But for
Jesus, being confined in a skeleton and human skin was the unnatural
state. The scars are a permanent reminder of His days of confinement
and suffering on our planet.

From the perspective of heaven, those scars represent the most
horrible event that has ever happened in the history of the universe.
Even that event, though, turned into a memory. Because of Easter, we
can hope that the tears we shed, the struggles we endure, the
emotional pain, the heartache over lost friends and loved ones—all
these will become memories, like Jesus’ scars. Scars never completely
go away, but neither do they hurt any longer. Someday we will have re-
created bodies and a re-created heaven and earth (Rev. 21:4). We will
have a new start, an Easter start.

Reflect & Pray

Thank You, Lord, for the hope that the resurrection of Jesus
brings—for now and for eternity. I put my trust in You today.

Christ’s resurrection is the guarantee of our own.
