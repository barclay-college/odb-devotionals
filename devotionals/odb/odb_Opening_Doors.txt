Opening Doors

Therefore go and make disciples of all nations.
Matthew 28:19

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 28:16-20

Charlie Sifford is an important name in American sports. He became the
first African-American playing member of the Professional Golfers
Association (PGA) Tour, joining a sport that, until 1961, had a
“whites only” clause in its by-laws. Enduring racial injustice and
harassment, Sifford earned his place at the game’s highest level, won
two tournaments, and in 2004 was the first African-American inducted
into the World Golf Hall of Fame. Charlie Sifford opened the doors of
professional golf for players of all ethnicities.

Opening doors is also a theme at the heart of the gospel mission.
Jesus said, “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely
I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (Matt. 28:19-20).

The word nations (v. 19) is from the Greek word ethnos, which is also
the source of the word ethnic. In other words, “Go and make disciples
of all ethnicities.” Jesus’ work on the cross opened the way to the
Father for everyone.

Now we have the privilege of caring for others as God has cared for
us. We can open the door for someone who never dreamed they’d be
welcomed personally into the house and family of God.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, help me to be sensitive to others I meet today. Give me the
words to tell others about You.

Jesus opened the doors of salvation to all who will believe.
