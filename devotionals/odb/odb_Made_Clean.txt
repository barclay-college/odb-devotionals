Made Clean

I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean.
Ezekiel 36:25

Today's Scripture & Insight: Ezekiel 36:24–32

When I opened our dishwasher, I wondered what went wrong. Instead of
seeing sparkling clean dishes, I removed plates and glasses that were
covered in a chalky dust. I wondered if the hard water in our area was
wreaking havoc, or if the machine was broken.

God’s cleansing, unlike that faulty dishwasher, washes away all of our
impurities. We see in the book of Ezekiel that God is calling His
people back to Himself as Ezekiel shared God’s message of love and
forgiveness. The Israelites had sinned as they proclaimed their
allegiance to other gods and other nations. The Lord, however, was
merciful in welcoming them back to Himself. He promised to cleanse
them “from all [their] impurities and all [their] idols” (36:25). As
He put His Spirit in them (v. 27), He would bring them to a place of
fruitfulness, not famine (v. 30).

As in the days of the prophet Ezekiel, today the Lord welcomes us back
to Him if we go astray. When we submit ourselves to His will and His
ways, He transforms us as He washes us clean from our sins. With His
Holy Spirit dwelling within us, He helps us to follow Him day by day.

Reflect & Pray

Lord God, the feeling of being cleansed and forgiven is like no other.
Thank You for transforming me into a new person. Teach me to submit to
You daily that I might grow more and more closely into the likeness of
Jesus.

The Lord makes us clean.
