Who Are You?

Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men. —
Matthew 4:19

Today's Scripture: Matthew 4:18-25

If someone were to ask, “Who are you?” my guess is that you would tell
a little about yourself and what you do—“I’m an electrician” or “I’m a
nurse.” But that’s not really who you are—it’s what you do. Which
leads to the question, If what you do is who you are, who will you be
when you stop doing what you’re doing?!

Who you are is found in your relationship to Jesus. And this sense of
identity will drive your behavior. Take Matthew, for example. As a tax
collector during the reign of the Roman Empire, his life was driven by
greed. But everything changed the day Jesus showed up and invited
Matthew to follow Him (Matt. 9:9). Suddenly Matthew had a whole new
identity as a follower of Christ! And he wasn’t the only one. We also
read about four fishermen in Matthew 4:18-25, Peter, Andrew, James,
and John, who left their nets to follow Him.

Jesus is a compelling Person, and He is still looking for followers.
He wants to make something of your life by giving you the identity of
a follower of Jesus. It doesn’t mean giving up your career, but it
does mean that you will do your work—and all of life—according to His
will and ways.

So next time someone asks, “Who are you?” I hope you’ll answer, “I’m a
follower of Jesus”!
