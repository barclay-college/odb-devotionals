Let’s Be Ready

Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself. —
1 John 3:3

Today's Scripture: 1 John 2:28–3:3

Happy New Year! Looking forward to what this new year might bring, I
can’t help but wonder if 2012 will be the year when Jesus comes back.
But then I also wonder if I’m ready.

All of my life I’ve had to “be ready.” As a child, I had to be ready
for dinner by washing my hands. As an adult, being ready for important
responsibilities continues to be an ongoing reality. But I’ve come to
realize that nothing is more important than being ready for our
reunion with Jesus.

Speaking of Christ’s return, John tells us that “everyone who has this
hope in Him purifies himself” (1 John 3:3). Looking forward to Jesus’
return fills us with hope—not a wish-list kind of hope, but a solid
expectation that motivates us to keep our hearts from sinful
distractions and rivets our attention on becoming more like Him. If we
really believe that this might be the year of His return, we will be
more ready to forgive, to seek forgiveness, and to share God’s
unconditional love with others.

As we consider the possibility that Jesus could return this year,
let’s be sure that we are ready. Let’s strive to be pure as He is
pure, anticipating the day when tears and sorrow, pain and death will
all be replaced with the everlasting joy of His presence.
