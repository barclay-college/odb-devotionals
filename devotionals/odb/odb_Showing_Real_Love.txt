Showing Real Love

By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for
one another. —
John 13:35

Today's Scripture: John 13:1-5,33-35

Chinese New Year happens to fall on the same day as Valentine’s Day in
2010. While these two festivals have very different origins, there are
some similarities in how they are celebrated. In both cases, loved
ones give gifts to express love for one another. Whether it is giving
roses to your beloved on Valentine’s Day or hong bao (red packets with
money) to family and friends on Chinese New Year, they represent
tokens of love.

Our Lord Jesus Christ commanded His disciples to “love one another,”
because “by this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have
love for one another” (John 13:34-35).

The love that our Lord wants His disciples to have for one another is
different from the romantic kind displayed between loving couples and
the brotherly kind shown between friends or family. It’s an unselfish
love. The Greek word John used in Jesus’ command is agape—God’s kind
of love that expects nothing in return. That was what Jesus showed to
His disciples when He “poured water into a basin and began to wash the
disciples’ feet” (v.5). That is the kind of love He displayed when He
went to the cross for us.

Today, look for someone to whom you can show such unselfish love.

Reflect & Pray

Lord, teach us the secret of loving, The love You are asking today;
Then help us to love one another; For this we most earnestly pray.
—Anon.

Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
—Galatians 6:2
