Words and Actions

Let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.
1 John 3:18

Today's Scripture & Insight: Matthew 21:28-32

The email from the student in my college writing class expressed
urgency. It was the end of the semester, and he realized he needed a
better grade to participate in sports. What could he do? He had missed
some assignments, so I gave him two days to complete those papers and
improve his grade. His response: “Thank you. I’ll do it.”

Two days—and the deadline—passed, and no papers appeared. He didn’t
back up his words with action.

Jesus told about a young man who did something similar. The boy’s dad
asked him to do some work in the vineyard. The son said, “I will, sir”
(Matt. 21:30). But he was all talk and no action.

In commenting on this parable, Matthew Henry concluded: “Buds and
blossoms are not fruit.” The buds and blossoms of our words, which
breed anticipation of what we might do, are empty without the fruit of
our follow-through. Jesus’ main application was to religious leaders
who spoke of obedience yet refused to follow through with repentance.
But the words apply to us as well. It is in following God “with
actions and in truth” (1 John 3:18)—not in making empty promises—that
we honor our Lord and Savior.

Our actions in obeying God show Him more love, honor, and praise than
any empty words we might say to try to appear good.

Reflect & Pray

Dear Father, help me to follow through on my promises to You and to
all who depend on me. Especially help me to do Your will and not just
talk about it.

Words are the blossoms, action the fruit.
