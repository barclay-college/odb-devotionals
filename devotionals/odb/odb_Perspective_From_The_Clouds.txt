Perspective From The Clouds

I have heard of You . . . but now my eye sees You. —
Job 42:5

Today's Scripture & Insight: Job 3:3-5; 42:5-6

In 1927 the silent film Wings, a World War I film about two American
aviators, won the first Academy Award for Best Picture. When it was
being filmed, production stopped for several days. Frustrated
producers asked the director why. He responded: “All we have is blue
sky. The conflict in the air will not be as visible without clouds.
Clouds bring perspective.” He was right. Only by seeing aerial combat
with clouds as a backdrop could the viewer see what was really going
on.

We often wish for blue skies instead of storm clouds. But cloudy skies
may reveal God’s faithfulness. We gain perspective on how God has been
faithful in our trials as we look back on the clouds.

At the beginning of his terrible suffering, Job lamented: “May the day
perish on which I was born . . . . May a cloud settle on it” (Job
3:3-5). His experience of despair continued for a long time until God
spoke. Then Job exclaimed, “I have heard of You . . . but now my eye
sees You” (42:5). Job had encountered the sovereign Creator, and that
changed his perspective on God’s purposes.

Do clouds of trouble fill your skies today? Sooner than you think, God
may use these clouds to help you gain perspective on His faithfulness.

Reflect & Pray

God, give us wings to rise above The clouds of trial that block the
sun, To soar above gray skies and see The love and goodness of Your
Son. —Sper

Often the clouds of sorrow reveal the sunshine of His face. —Jasper
