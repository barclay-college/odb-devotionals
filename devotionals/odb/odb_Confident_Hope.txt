Confident Hope

For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
Philippians 1:21

Today's Scripture & Insight: Philippians 1:19–26

Dr. William Wallace was serving as a missionary surgeon in Wuzhou,
China, in the 1940s when Japan attacked China. Wallace, who was in
charge of Stout Memorial Hospital at the time, ordered the hospital to
load his equipment on barges and continue to function as a hospital
while floating up and down rivers to avoid infantry attacks.

During dangerous times, Philippians 1:21—one of Wallace’s favorite
verses—reminded him that if he lived, he had work to do for the
Savior; but if he died, he had the promise of eternity with Christ.
The verse took on special meaning when he died while falsely
imprisoned in 1951.

Paul’s writing reflects a deep devotion we can aspire to as followers
of Jesus, enabling us to face trials and even danger for His sake. It
is devotion enabled by the Holy Spirit and the prayers of those
closest to us (v. 19). It’s also a promise. Even when we surrender
ourselves to continued service under difficult circumstances, it is
with this reminder: when our life and work end here, we still have the
joy of eternity with Jesus ahead of us.

In our hardest moments, with hearts committed to walking with Christ
now, and with our eyes firmly fixed on the promise of eternity with
Him, may our days and our acts bless others with the love of God.

Reflect & Pray

Make of me, Father, a willing servant in times of weakness and times
of strength.

Sacrifices offered to God are opportunities to showcase His love.
